# Pointing nouns

## Introduction

Pointing nouns are the Arabic equivalents of words like "this", "that", "these", "those". We call them pointing nouns because a person saying "This man.", for example, could be pointing to a man near him. Pointing nouns are used in sentences like:

+ "This is a house."
+ "These women are good."
+ "That is a book."

The pointing nouns in Arabic are:

|Person|Pointing noun (u-state)|Pointing noun (a-state and i-state)|
|:--|:--|:--|
|this~masc.~ one         |[هَـٰذَا]{.ar}   [hApA]{.trn}     | same |
|this~fem.~ one          |[هَـٰذِهِ]{.ar}   [hApihi]{.trn}   | same |
|these~dual\ masc.~ ones |[هَـٰذَانِ]{.ar}  [hApAni]{.trn}   |[هَـٰذَيْنِ]{.ar}  [hApayni]{.trn}   |
|these~dual\ fem.~ ones  |[هَاتَانِ]{.ar}  [hAtAni]{.trn}   |[هَاتَيْنِ]{.ar}  [hAtayni]{.trn}   |
|these~pl.~ ones         |[هَـٰؤُلَاءِ]{.ar} [hAEulAEi]{.trn} | same  |
|that~masc.~ one         |[ذَ ٰلِكَ]{.ar}   [pAlika]{.trn}   | same  |
|that~fem.~ one          |[تِلْكَ]{.ar}    [tilka]{.trn}    | same  |
|those~dual\ masc.~ ones |[ذَ ٰنِكَ]{.ar}   [pAnika]{.trn}   |[ذَيْنِكَ]{.ar}   [paynika]{.trn}   |
|those~dual\ fem.~ ones  |[تَانِكَ]{.ar}   [tAnika]{.trn}   |[تَيْنِكَ]{.ar}   [taynika]{.trn}   |
|those~pl.~ ones         |[أُولَـٰئِكَ]{.ar} [EulAEika]{.trn} | same |

Note the following regarding the pointing nouns shown above:

+ Many of the pointing nouns contain small [Ealif]{.trn} [◌ٰ]{.ar}. For most of them, this is how they must be written. It would be incorrect to write [هَـٰذَا]{.ar} [hApA]{.trn} as [هَاذَا]{.ar}.
+ The pointing nouns are the same in all states except for the dual, where [ـَانِ]{.ar} [-Ani]{.trn} in the u-state becomes [ـَيْنِ]{.ar} [-ayni]{.trn} in the a-state and i-state.
+ The pointing nouns for the plural are the same for both masculine and feminine genders.

## Usage of pointing nouns

### In noun-phrases with common nouns

A pointing noun can be used in a noun phrase for expressions like "this man". We can express this using the pointing noun 
[هَـٰذَا]{.ar} [hApA]{.trn} "this~masc.~ one" and the noun being pointed to [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrujulu]{.trn} "the man". We put the two nouns together thus:

[هَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}  
[hApA -rrujulu]{.trn}  
"this one, the man" = "this man"

We can also switch the order of the two nouns with the same meaning:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ هَـٰذَا]{.ar}  
[Earujulu hApA]{.trn}  
"the man, this one" = "this man"

Both of these orders are permissible with the same meaning with the first order ([هَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}) being more common.

These noun-phrases are very similar to the ones we learned for desccribers. In fact, we can add a describer to the noun-phrases above:

[هَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ]{.ar}  
[hApA -rrujulu -lkarImu]{.trn}  
"this one, the noble man" = "this noble man"

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ هَـٰذَا]{.ar}  
[Earujulu -lkarImu hApA]{.trn}  
"the noble man, this one" = "this noble man"

These noun-phrases can be used in sentences too:

[هَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ عَظِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
[hApA -rrujulu -lkarImu eaPImun.]{.trn}  
"This one, the noble man, is great" = "This noble man is great."

Here are some more examples with some of the other pointing nouns:

+ [ضَرَبَتْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ تِلْكَ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
+ [قَرَأَ ذَ ٰنِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَانِ تَيْنِكَ ٱلرِّسَالَتَيْنِ ٱلطَّوِيلَتَيْنِ.]{.ar}
+ [هَاتَانِ ٱلْهِرَّتَانِ ٱلصَّغِيرَتَانِ لَكُمَا وَهَـٰذَانِ ٱلْكَلْبَانِ لَنَا.]{.ar}
+ [هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالُ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلْغِلْمَانُ خَرَجُوا مِنَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}

### Independent pointing nouns in subject-information sentences

A pointing noun is considered definite even though it does not have [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. It can be used as a subject in subject information sentences. Here are some examples:

[هَـٰذَا رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[hApA rajulun]{.trn}  
"This is a man."

Such phrases consist of a pointing noun ("this") and the noun being pointed to ("man"). 

In Arabic, pointing nouns

In Arabic we cannot express a pointed-to noun like "man". We have to say either [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" or [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrujulu]{.trn} "the man". We choose the definite noun [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrujulu]{.trn}

Both the pointing noun and the noun being pointed to are considered definite.

In English, the noun being pointed to does not have the word "the". However, in Arabic the noun being pointed to will have [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. 

Also, in English, the pointing noun comes before the noun being pointed to. In Arabic, the pointing noun may come before or 

### In subject-information sentences

A pointing noun is considered definite even though it does not have [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. It can be used as a subject in subject information sentences. Here are some examples:

+ 
[هَـٰذَا رَجُلٌ]{.ar}   [hApA]{.trn}     
[هَـٰذِهِ]{.ar}   [hApihi]{.trn}   
[هَـٰذَانِ]{.ar}  [hApAni]{.trn}   
[هَاتَانِ]{.ar}  [hAtAni]{.trn}   
[هَـٰؤُلَاءِ]{.ar} [hAEulAEi]{.trn} 
[ذَ ٰلِكَ]{.ar}   [pAlika]{.trn}   
[تِلْكَ]{.ar}    [tilka]{.trn}    
[ذَ ٰنِكَ]{.ar}   [pAnika]{.trn}   
[تَانِكَ]{.ar}   [tAnika]{.trn}   
[أُولَـٰئِكَ]{.ar} [EulAEika]{.trn}
