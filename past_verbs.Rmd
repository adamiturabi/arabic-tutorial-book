# Completed-action verbs

## Introduction

Verbs are action words. Verbs can be either _completed-action_ verbs where the action of the verb has been completed, e.g., "The boy went." or _incomplete-action_ verbs where the action of the verb is on-going or not yet completed, e.g., "The boy goes." In this chapter we will study _completed-action_ verbs.

## Arabic word roots

We take this oppurtunity to learn about Arabic roots. 
Native Arabic words, both nouns and verbs, are generally derived from roots. Most roots are comprised of three letters. A smaller number are comprised of four or more letters. 

Words are derived from their roots according to patterns. In traditional Arabic grammar studies, the root [فعل]{.arroot} is used as a template for three-letter roots to showcase word and meaning patterns. 

Now, we will learn some examples of completed-action verbs and see how they are derived from their roots.

## Form of the completed-action verb

Here are some examples of the basic form of completed-action verbs in Arabic:

Root | Verb basic form | Meaning
:----|:----|:----
[فعل]{.arroot} |[فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} |"did"
[ذهب]{.arroot} |[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} |"went"
[كتب]{.arroot} |[كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} |"wrote"
[جعل]{.arroot} |[جَعَلَ]{.ar} [jaeala]{.trn} |"made"
[ضرب]{.arroot} |[ضَرَبَ]{.ar} [Daraba]{.trn} |"hit"
[علم]{.arroot} |[عَلِمَ]{.ar} [ealima]{.trn} |"knew"
[عمل]{.arroot} |[عَمِلَ]{.ar} [eamila]{.trn} |"worked"
[كبر]{.arroot} |[كَبُرَ]{.ar} [kabura]{.trn} |"grew"

Note this basic form consists only of the three letters of the root. The first and the final letter always have an [a]{.trn}-mark while the middle letter's vowel is variable. It may have an [a]{.trn}-mark, [i]{.trn}-mark, or an [u]{.trn}-mark, depending on the verb. Using the root template [فعل]{.arroot}, we can say that the basic form the verb occurs in the patterns [فَعَلَ]{.ar}, [فَعِلَ]{.ar}, and [فَعُلَ]{.ar}. 

A good dictionary will tell us the middle vowel mark of a particular verb. However, as a trend, the [a]{.trn}-mark is the most common for the middle vowel mark, followed by the [i]{.trn}-mark, while the [u]{.trn}-mark is the least common.

Interestingly, there can exist multiple verbs from the same root, each with its own distinct meaning, that differ only in the vowel mark on the middle letter. The most common example is:

+ [حَسَبَ]{.ar} [Hasaba]{.trn} "computed"
+ [حَسِبَ]{.ar} [Hasiba]{.trn} "deemed"

Note, by the way, that [فعل]{.arroot}, in addition to being used as a root template, also has a verb in its own right: [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} "did".

You can see above how the verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "wrote" is derived from the root [كتب]{.arroot}. We have already, by the way, learned another word derived from this root: the noun [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book", which is on the pattern [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}. Note how both the verb and the noun derived from this root have a meaning that is common and has to do with writing or of something written. 
In a similar manner, you will often see that words derived from the same root generally share some common meaning, although this common meaning may not always be obvious or straightforward.

## Verbs with noun doers

When a verb is in a sentence, it requires a doer. A doer is a noun or a pronoun that does the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence "The boy went.", the noun "the boy" is the doer of the verb.

### Verbs with a masculine doer noun

Consider the sentence:

"The boy went." 

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy went." 

[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "went" is the verb and [ٱلْغُلَامُ]{.ar} [algulAmu]{.trn} "the boy" is the doer. Note how the doer is in the u-state. Also note that in English the doer comes before the verb whereas in Arabic the doer comes after the verb.
In Arabic, a doer noun shall always be in the u-state and shall come after the verb in word order.

The basic form of the verb [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} is specifically for masculine doers. We shall see in the next section how the verb is modified for feminine doers. 

The doer may be definite, indefinite, a common noun, or a proper noun. Examples:

A boy went.

Muhammad went.

The time went.

### Verbs with a feminine doer noun

Now consider the sentence:

"A girl went." 

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatun]{.trn}  
"A girl went." 

Note that we have modified the verb by adding on the letter [تْ]{.ar} at the end. This [تْ]{.ar} is to indicate that the doer is feminine and is called the [تْ]{.ar} of femininity. If the word following the noun begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} then we add a helper vowel to the [تْ]{.ar} and it becomes [تِ]{.ar}. Examples:

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْبَقَرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -lbaqaratu.]{.trn}  
"The cow went."

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -mraEatun.]{.trn}  
"A woman went."

Note that whether or not we add a helper vowel to [تْ]{.ar}, the letter before it always has an [a]{.trn}-mark.

## Verbs with direct doees

Consider the sentence:

"The man wrote a book."

In this sentence, "wrote" is the verb, "the man" is the doer, and "a book" is what we shall call the _doee_. In fact, it is what we shall call a _direct doee_ because it comes directly after the verb. A doee is the noun to whom the action of verb is done. 

Some verbs take an _indirect doee_ which occurs with a preposition before it.  We will learn about indirect doees in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, once we have studied prepositions.

In Arabic, we will express the sentence "The man wrote a book." by saying:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrajulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

Note how in Arabic the doee [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" is in the a-state. This is because, in Arabic, verbs shall cause a direct doee to be in the a-state. This is true whether the direct doee is definite or indefinite. Here is another example:

[ضَرَبَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabati -lmarEatu -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"The woman hit the girl."

Note again how [ٱلْجَارِيَةَ]{.ar} [aljAriyata]{.trn} "the girl" is in the a-state because it is a direct doee.

### Multiple direct doees

Some verbs can take more than one direct doee. In this case, all direct doees shall be in the a-state. For example,

[جَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُسْلِمًا.]{.ar}  
[jaeala -llAhu -rrajula musliman.]{.trn}  
"[#allAh]{.trn2} made the man a Muslim."

In this sentence both [ٱلرَّجُلَ]{.ar} [arrajula]{.trn} "the man" and [مُسْلِمًا]{.ar} [musliman]{.trn} "a Muslim" are direct doees of the verb [جَعَلَ]{.ar} [jaeala]{.trn} and therefore both are placed in the a-state.

### Indirect doees

// Move this section to prepositions chapter.



By the way, it is entirely possible that an English verb may take a direct doee, while the corresponding Arabic verb may only take an indirect doee. The reverse is also quite possible. For example,

[غَفَرَ ٱللَّـٰهُ لِلْمُسْلِمِ.]{.ar}  
[gafara -llAhu -lmuslimi.]{.trn}  
"[#allAh]{.trn2} forgave the Muslim."

It is also possible that an English verb may take an indirect doee with a particular preposition whereas the corresponding Arabic verb may take the indirect doee with a different preposition. For example,

[غَضِبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ مِنَ ٱلْغُلَامِ.]{.ar}  
[gaDiba -rrajulu mina -lgulAmi.]{.trn}  
"The man was angry with the boy."

## Verbs with doer pronouns

A pronoun may replace a noun as the doer of a verb. For example, instead of saying "Zayd went", you can say "he went", or "you went", etc. In Arabic, doer pronouns are either visible or invisible.

In Arabic, visible doer pronouns exist for "I" and "you". "You" is differentiated for masculine and feminine doers whereas "I" is not. Visible doer pronouns are attached to the basic form of the verb while modifying the vowel on the final letter of the verb. For example,

Doer pronoun | Verb | Transcription | Meaning
:---|:---|:---|:---
[تُ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتُ]{.ar} | [pahabtu]{.trn} | "I went"
[تَ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتَ]{.ar} | [pahabta]{.trn} | "You~masc.~ went"
[تِ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتِ]{.ar} | [pahabti]{.trn} | "You~fem.~ went"

The remaining singular doer pronouns: "he" and "she" are invisible in Arabic. So if we wish to say "He went." we will simply say:

[ذَهَبَ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba.]{.trn}  
"He went."

And for "She went." we will say:

[ذَهَبَتْ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat.]{.trn}  
"She went."

Take care to note that doer pronouns modify the final letter of the basic verb, whereas the [تْ]{.ar} of "she" or feminine doer nouns does not. So make sure you see the difference in the following two sentences:

[ضَرَبْتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabti -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"You~fem.~ hit the girl."

[ضَرَبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabati -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"She hit the girl."

## Verbs with doee pronouns

Just like doer nouns may be replaced with doer pronouns, doee nouns may too be replaced with _doee pronouns_. Doee pronouns are also attached to the end of the verb, while not modifying the vowel on the final letter of the verb. The doee pronouns are:

Person | Doee pronoun
:------| :--
Non-participating person (masc.) "him" | [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}
Non-participating person (fem.)  "her" | [هَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn}
Spoken-to person (masc.)  "you~masc.~" | [كَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn}
Spoken-to person (fem.)  "you~fem.~"   | [كِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn}
Speaking person (masc. and fem.)  "me" | [ي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn} or [يَ]{.ar} [-ya]{.trn}

Here are some notes regarding their usage:

+ Doee pronouns shall always be attached to the verb. So if there is a doer noun then it shall be placed after the attached doee pronoun. For example:

  [سَأَلَهُ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
  [saEalahu -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
  "The boy asked him."

+ If however, the doer is also a pronoun, then it shall be attached first to the verb and then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the doer pronoun. For example,

  [سَأَلْتُكِ.]{.ar}  
  [saEaltuki.]{.trn}  
  "I asked you~fem.~."

+ If the doer pronoun is invisible, then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the verb again directly with only a possible [تْ]{.ar} of femininity intervening. For example:

  [سَأَلَهَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalahA.]{.trn}  
  "He asked her."

  [سَأَلَتْكَ.]{.ar}  
  [saEalatka.]{.trn}  
  "She asked you~masc.~."

+ If the doee pronoun [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn} "him" is preceded by the vowels [i]{.trn}, [I]{.trn}, or [ay]{.trn} then it shall instead become [هِ]{.ar} [hi]{.trn} with no change in meaning. For example,

  [سَأَلْتِهِ.]{.ar}  
  [saEaltihi]{.trn}  
  "You~fem.~ asked him."

+ There are two options for the doer pronoun for "me":

  1. [ي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}
  2. [يَ]{.ar} [ya]{.trn}

  Both are written with an intervening [نِ]{.ar} between the verb and the doee pronoun. For example:

  [سَأَلَنِي زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
  [saEalanI zaydun.]{.trn}  
  "Zayd asked me."

  [سَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
  [saEalaniya -rrujulu.]{.trn}  
  "The man asked me."

  The [نِ]{.ar} is purely for intervening between the verb and the doee pronoun and has no meaning on its own. If there is a doer pronoun used, it shall come before the intervening [نِ]{.ar} so that the [نِ]{.ar} is always connected to the doee pronoun. For example,

  [سَأَلْتَنِي.]{.ar}  
  [saEaltanI]{.trn}  
  "You~(masc.)~ asked me."

  So why don't we simply incorporate the [نِ]{.ar} with the doee pronoun and say that the doee pronoun for "me" is [نِي]{.ar} [-nI]{.trn} and [نِيَ]{.ar} [-niya]{.trn}? This is because in addition to their use as doee pronouns, these same pronouns are also used in other places as we shall see in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, and in those cases there is often no intervening [نِ]{.ar} for the speaking person pronoun. <!--exceptions like منّي and others -->

  Note how we used [يَ]{.ar} [-ya]{.trn} when it was followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} ([سَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}), and [ي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn} when it was not followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} ([سَأَلَنِي زَيْدٌ]{.ar}). Such is often the case. But it is also quite common for [ي]{.ar} to be used when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. When this happens, the vowel will be shortened to [i]{.trn} in pronunciation, although the [ي]{.ar} is retained in writing. For example,

  [سَأَلَنِي ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
  [saEalani -rrujulu.]{.trn}  
  "The man asked me."

  However, [يَ]{.ar} [-ya]{.trn} is typically not used as a doee pronoun if not followed by a connecting [hamza]{.trn}. 

  To summarize, generally speaking, although both are often permissible, [ي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn} is the more commonly used in all circumstances except in specific cases where [ي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn} is impermissible and [يَ]{.ar} [-ya]{.trn} is required. We will mention those cases when we encounter them, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

## Order of words in a sentence

### Changing the order of words for emphasis

In Arabic, the doer always follows the verb. So the normal order of a sentence is verb-doer-doee. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

However, we will often come across sentences like:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kataba kitAban.]{.trn}

It may appear as if [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} is the doer and it is coming before the verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn}. But actually, this is a subject-information sentence. 

Here [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} "the man" is the subject of the sentence, and [كَتَبَ كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kataba kitAban.]{.trn} "he wrote a book" is the information about the subject. So the translation of the sentence is technically:

"The man, he wrote a book."

However, this is an awkward sentence in English so we will translate it as "The man wrote a book." But this is also the translation of:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

So why then would we say [ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [Earrujulu kataba kitAban.]{.trn} instead of the more normal [كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}? The answer is that this change in the sentence's word order is done in order to give more emphasis to the doer, as if to say:

"_The man_ wrote a book."

So in Arabic, the order of words is generally more flexible than in English and this is often used to give emphasis to certain words.

### Indefinite doers

If a verb's doer is an indefinite noun, it is often, but not always, placed at the end of the sentence. This too is for emphasis. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ رَجُلٌ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -lkitAba rajulun.]{.trn}  
"A man wrote the book."

### Multiple verbs for one doer

In a sentence that has multiple verbs separated by "and", normally one of them is placed before the doer and the rest after it. For example,

[أَكَلَ ٱلرَّجُلُ وَشَرِبَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -rrajulu wacariba.]{.trn}  
"The man ate and drank."

## Separating doee pronouns from the verb

We have mentioned that doee pronouns are attached to the verb. Sometimes there is a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb. When separating the doee pronoun from the verb, it is instead attached to the prefix [إِيَّا]{.ar} [EiyyA]{.trn}. So then we get the following doee pronouns:

1. [إِيَّاهُ]{.ar} [EiyyAhu]{.trn} "him".
2. [إِيَّاهَا]{.ar} [EiyyAhA]{.trn} "her".
3. [إِيَّاكَ]{.ar} [EiyyAka]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
4. [إِيَّاكِ]{.ar} [EiyyAki]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
5. [إِيَّايَ]{.ar} [EiyyAya]{.trn} "me (masc. & fem)". Note that an [a]{.trn}-mark is placed on the [ي]{.ar}.

But why is there a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb? This can occur for a couple of reasons:

i. If there are multiple doee pronouns, only one of them can be attached to the verb. Example,

   [ضَرَبَتْنِي وَإِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
   [DarabatnI wa EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  
   "She hit me and him."

ii. If the doee is placed before the verb for emphasis. Example,

    [إِيَّايَ ضَرَبَتْ.]{.ar}  
    [EiyyAya Darabat.]{.trn}  
    "She hit _me_."
