# Completed-action verbs

## Introduction

Verbs are action words. Every verb needs a noun that does the action of the verb. This noun is called the _doer_. 

## Verbs with a masculine doer noun

Consider the sentence:

"The boy went." 

In this sentence the word "went" is the verb, and "the boy" is the doer of the verb. This verb in this sentence is a _completed-action_ verb. It is called so because the action "went" has been completed. The _incomplete-action_ verb associated with this action is "goes". In this chapter we will learn about _complete-action_ verbs only.

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy went." 

[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "went" is the verb and [ٱلْغُلَامُ]{.ar} [algulAmu]{.trn} "the boy" is the doer. Note that in English the doer comes before the verb whereas in Arabic the doer comes after the verb.

The for of the verb [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} is specifically for masculine doers. We shall see in the next section how the verb is modified for feminine doers. With this verb, the masculine doer may be definite, indefinite, a common noun, or a proper noun. Examples:

A boy went.

Muhammad went.

The time went.

## Verbs with a feminine doer noun

Now consider the sentence:

"A girl went." 

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatun]{.trn}  
"A girl went." 

---


We will classify verbs into completed-action verbs and incomplete-action verbs.

Here are some English sentences with completed-action verbs:

+ He wrote a book.
+ She wrote a book.
+ You wrote a book.
+ I wrote a book.

Each of these sentences has:

1. a pronoun ("he", "she", "you", "I") which is the doer of the verb,
2. the verb itself: "wrote", and
3. the doee of the verb, i.e., the object upon whom the action of the verb is done: "a book".

Notice in each sentence that the verb "wrote" remains the same irrespective of the doer of the verb.

## Verb doer-modifications

In Arabic, we don't require a separate pronoun for the doer when using a verb. The verb itself is modified for each doer. The basic verb stem is used for the doer pronoun "he", for example [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "he wrote". And this basic verb stem is modified for the other doer pronouns:

1. [كَتَبَ]{.ar}   [kataba]{.trn} "He wrote."
2. [كَتََبَتْ]{.ar}  [katabat]{.trn} "She wrote."
3. [كَتَبْتَ]{.ar}  [katabta]{.trn} "You (sing. masc.) wrote."
4. [كَتَبْتِ]{.ar}  [katabti]{.trn} "You (sing. fem.) wrote."
5. [كَتَبْتُ]{.ar}  [katabtu]{.trn} "I wrote."

Note the same verb doer-modification for the speaking person is used for both masculine and feminine doers. 

## Verbs with doees

### Direct doees

The examples in the previous section are complete sentences in and of themselves. However, we can add to the sentence a noun that the action of the verb is done to. This noun is called the doee. For example, in the sentence "He wrote a book.", "he" is the doer and "a book" is the doee. In fact it is a direct doee because there is not preposition before the doee. In Arabic, the direct doee of a verb is placed in the a-state. Examples:

1.  [كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [kataba kitAban.]{.trn} "He wrote a book."
2. [كَتََبَتْ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabat kitAban.]{.trn} "She wrote a book."
3. [كَتَبْتَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabta kitAban.]{.trn} "You~sing.\ masc.~ wrote a book."
4. [كَتَبْتِ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabti kitAban.]{.trn} "You~sing.\ fem.~ wrote a book."
5. [كَتَبْتُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabtu kitAban.]{.trn} "I wrote a book."

Note that in each of the above examples, the doee [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" is in the a-state which is indicated by the [an]{.trn}-mark on the final letter.

The doee may be a definite noun instead of an indefinite noun, in which case it shall lose the [n]{.trn}-mark and be prefixed with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. However, it shall still be in the a-state. For example,

+ [كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
  [kataba -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
  "He wrote the book."
  
+ [كَتَبَتِ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
  [katabati -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
  "She wrote the book."

  Note that in this sentence, a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} followed the verb [كَتَبَتْ]{.ar} [katabat]{.trn} so the null-vowel mark on the final letter was changed to an [i]{.trn}-mark: [كَتَبَتِ]{.ar} [katabati]{.trn}. Care must be taken to distinguish this from [كَتَبْتِ]{.ar} [katabti]{.trn} "You~fem.~ wrote".

It is possible for a verb to have more than one direct doee. In this case, both doees shall be in the u-state. For example,

[جَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُسْلِمًا.]{.ar}  
[jaeala -llAhu -rrajula musliman.]{.trn}  
"[#allAh]{.trn2} made the man a Muslim."

### Indirect doees

So far we have seen examples of a verb with a direct doee. Indirect doees are possible as well...

### Remove

In Arabic the doer pronoun is attached to the completed-action verb as a suffix. For example, the verb "wrote" in Arabic is [كَتَبْ]{.ar} [katab]{.trn}. And these are the doer pronoun suffixes:

1. [◌َ]{.ar}  [a]{.trn}  "he"
2. [ـَتْ]{.ar} [at]{.trn} "she"
3. [تَ]{.ar}  [ta]{.trn} "you (sing. masc.)"
4. [تِ]{.ar}  [ti]{.trn} "you (sing. fem.)"
5. [تُ]{.ar}  [tu]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.)"

Each of these can be attached to the basic verb stem [كَتَبْ]{.ar} [katab]{.trn} "wrote":

1. [◌َ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبَ]{.ar}   [kataba]{.trn} "He wrote."
2. [ـَتْ]{.ar} + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتََبَتْ]{.ar}  [katabat]{.trn} "She wrote."
3. [تَ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتَ]{.ar}  [katabta]{.trn} "You (sing. masc.) wrote."
4. [تِ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتِ]{.ar}  [katabti]{.trn} "You (sing. fem.) wrote."
5. [تُ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتُ]{.ar}  [katabtu]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.) wrote."

## Verbs with noun doers

So far we have seen verbs whose doers were pronouns ("he", "she", "you", "I"). Similar to English, instead of these pronouns, verbs may have nouns as doers. When a verb has a doer noun, the doer-modification is still kept (but not translated). Also, the doer noun may be placed before or after the verb. In this regard, Arabic sentence word order is more flexible than English. Normally, though, the verb comes before the doer-noun.

For example,

+ [كَتَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
  [katabat jAriyatun kitAban.]{.trn}  
  "A girl wrote a book."
+ [ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
  [Earrujulu kataba -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
  "The man wrote the book."

Arabic uses noun-state rather than word order to determine who the doer and the doee is. Note that the doer noun in the u-state and that the doee is in the a-state. Note also, as we mentioned, that the verb keeps its doer-modification when the doer noun is mentioned. In translating the sentence to English, however, we will not translate the doer prefix in sentences when the doer noun is present.

### Remove

+ Even when the doer is a noun, the doer-modifications for "he" or "she" are still attached to the verb depending on the gender of the doer. However, they are not translated.
+ The doer nouns are in the u-state. Doer nouns shall generally be in the u-state. 
+ (FIXME: also add doer before verb). The doer noun follows the verb. Sentence word order is somewhat flexible in Arabic but normally a verb's doer comes after the verb. English primarily uses word order to determine who the doer of a verb is and who the doee is. Conversely, Arabic uses the nouns' states to determine the doer and doee. As mentioned, the doer will be in the u-state and the doee will be in the a-state.

## Vowel marks in the completed-action verb

The completed-action verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "he wrote" has an [a]{.trn}-mark on all three letters. For now we will be studying completed-action verbs comprising of only three letters. But actually only the first and third letter are guaranteed to have an [a]{.trn}-mark. Depending on the verb, the middle letter can carry an [i]{.trn}-mark or [u]{.trn}-mark instead of an [a]{.trn}-mark. So, for example, we can have,

+ [عَمِلَ]{.ar} [eamila]{.trn} "he worked"
+ [كَبُرَ]{.ar} [kabura]{.trn} "he became big"

The vowel mark on the middle letter is preserved for all doer-modifications. So "I worked" will be [عَمِلْتُ]{.ar}.

Interestingly, there can exist two verbs, each with its own distinct meaning, that have the same three letters and differ only in the vowel mark on the middle letter. The most common example is:

+ [حَسَبَ]{.ar} [Hasaba]{.trn} "he computed"
+ [حَسِبَ]{.ar} [Hasiba]{.trn} "He deemed"

## Attached pronouns for the doee

We had learned in the previous sentence that we can replace nouns with pronouns. And we learned the following detached pronouns:

1. [هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} "he".
2. [هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} "she".
3. [أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
4. [أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
5. [أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.)". 

Here we will learn that we can replace a doee noun with a pronoun too. In this case we will use _attached pronouns_. These pronouns are attached to the verb. Here are the attached pronouns for the singular:

1. [ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn} "him". This pronoun becomes[هِ]{.ar} [hi]{.trn} if it is preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar}. <!-- [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}.-->
2. [ـهَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn} "her".
1. [ـكَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
2. [ـكِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
1. [ـنِي]{.ar} [-nI]{.trn} "me (masc. & fem)". 

Here are some examples of verbs with both doer and doee pronouns:

+ [ضَرَبَهُ.]{.ar}  
  [Darabahu.]{.trn}  
  "He hit him."
+ [ضَرَبْتِهِ.]{.ar}  
  [Darabtihi.]{.trn}  
  "You~fem.~ hit him."
+ [ضَرَبَتْهَا]{.ar}  
  [DarabathA]{.trn}  
  "She hit her."
+ [ضَرَبُتُكَ.]{.ar}  
  [Darabtuka.]{.trn}  
  "I hit you~masc.~."
+ [ضَرَبَكِ.]{.ar}  
  [Darabaki]{.trn}  
  "He hit you~fem.~."
+ [ضَرَبْتَنِي.]{.ar}  
  [DarabtanI.]{.trn}  
  "You~masc.~ hit me."

Where the verb has a doee pronoun and doer noun is mentioned, the doer noun must not come between the verb and the attached pronoun for the doee. Examples:

+ [ضَرَبَنِي ٱلرَّجُلُ..]{.ar}  
  [Darabani -rrujulu.]{.trn}  
  "The man hit me."
  or  
  [ٱَلرُّجُلُ ضَرَبَنِي.]{.ar}  
  [Earrujulu DarabanI.]{.trn}  
  "The man hit me."

## Detached pronouns with verbs

So far we have seen that verbs are modified for the doer and that attached pronouns are used for the doee. Now we will show that the detached pronouns, that we have already learned, can be added to emphasize either the doer or the doee. Here some examples:

+ [هُوَ ضَرَبَنِي.]{.ar}  
  [huwa DarabanI.]{.trn}  
  "*He* hit me."

+ [ضَرَبَتْنِي أَنَا.]{.ar}  
  [DarabatnI Eana.]{.trn}  
  "She hit *me*."

+ [أَنْتَ ضَرَبْتَ ٱلْغُلَامَ.]{.ar}  
  [Eanata Darabta -lgulAma.]{.trn}  
  "*You~sing.\ masc.~* hit the boy."

The location of this emphasizing detached pronoun is somewhat flexible but usually it will be placed before the verb for the doer and right after the attched doee pronoun for the doee.

## Sentence word order

### Flexibility in word order

As we mentioned, Arabic sentence word order is more flexible than English. The normal word order is verb-doer-doee. Foe example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrujulu -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote the book."

The second most common word order is doer-verb-doee. This may be used to emphasize the doer. For example,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kataba -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
"**The man** wrote the book."

In addition to the two more common sentence word orders above, other combinations are possible as well. Here is an example of a sentence with the word order doee-verb-doer. This sentence word may be employed to emphasize the doee.

[ٱَلْكِتَابَ كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
[EalkitAba kataba -rrajulu.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote **the book**."

Note that in all the examples above, the doer is in the u-state and the doee is in the a-state.

### Indefinite doers

If a verb's doer is an indefinite noun, it is often, but not always, placed at the end of the sentence, after any doee or prepositional phrase. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ رَجُلٌ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -lkitAba rajulun.]{.trn}  
"A man wrote the book."

[ذَهَبَتْ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat Eila -lbayti -mraEatun.]{.trn}  
"A woman went to the house."

### Multiple verbs for one doer

In a sentence that has multiple verbs separated by "and", normally one of them is placed before the doer and the rest after it. For example,

[أَكَلَ ٱلرَّجُلُ وَشَرِبَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -rraujulu washariba.]{.trn}  
"The man ate and drank."

It is also possible to place both verbs after the doer, like:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ أَكَلَ وَشَرِبَ.]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu Eakala washariba.]{.trn}  
"The man ate and drank."

## Separating doee pronouns from the verb

We have mentioned that doee pronouns are attached to the verb. Sometimes there is a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb. When separating the doee pronoun from the verb, it is instead attached to the prefix [إِيَّا]{.ar} [EiyyA]{.trn}. There is also a slight modification specifically for the speaking-person pronoun. So then we get the following doee pronouns:

1. [إِيَّاهُ]{.ar} [EiyyAhu]{.trn} "him".
2. [إِيَّاهَا]{.ar} [EiyyAhA]{.trn} "her".
3. [إِيَّاكَ]{.ar} [EiyyAka]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
4. [إِيَّاكِ]{.ar} [EiyyAki]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
5. [إِيَّايَ]{.ar} [EiyyAya]{.trn} "me (masc. & fem)". Note that the [ن]{.ar} in [ـنِي]{.ar} is deleted and an [a]{.trn}-mark is placed on the [ي]{.ar}.

But why is there a need to separae the doee pronoun from the verb? This can occur for a couple of reasons:

i. If there are multiple doee pronouns, only one of them can be attached to the verb. Example,

   [ضَرَبَتْنِي وَإِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
   [DarabatnI wa EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  
   "She hit me and him."

ii. If the doee is placed before the verb for emphasis. Example,

    [إِيَّايَ ضَرَبَتْ.]{.ar}  
    [EiyyAya Darabat.]{.trn}  
    "She hit _me_."
