# Completed-action verbs

## Introduction

Verbs are action words. Verbs can be either _completed-action_ verbs where the action of the verb has been completed, e.g., "The boy went." or _incomplete-action_ verbs where the action of the verb is on-going or not yet completed, e.g., "The boy goes." In this chapter we will study _completed-action_ verbs.

## Form of the completed-action verb

Here are some examples of the basic form of completed-action verbs in Arabic:

Verb | Transcription | Meaning
:----|:----|:----
[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} |[pahaba]{.trn} |"went"
[كَتَبَ]{.ar} |[kataba]{.trn} |"wrote"
[جَعَلَ]{.ar} |[jaeala]{.trn} |"made"
[ضَرَبَ]{.ar} |[Daraba]{.trn} |"hit"
[عَلِمَ]{.ar} |[ealima]{.trn} |"knew"
[عَمِلَ]{.ar} |[eamila]{.trn} |"worked"
[كَبُرَ]{.ar} |[kabura]{.trn} |"grew"

Note the basic form consists of three letters. The first and the third letter always have an [a]{.trn}-mark while the second letter's vowel is variable. It may have an [a]{.trn}-mark, [i]{.trn}-mark, or an [u]{.trn}-mark, depending on the verb. A good dictionary will tell us the middle vowel mark of a particular verb. However, [a]{.trn}-marks are the most common followed by the [i]{.trn}-mark, while [u]{.trn}-marks is the most uncommon.

Interestingly, there can exist two verbs, each with its own distinct meaning, that have the same three letters and differ only in the vowel mark on the middle letter. The most common example is:

+ [حَسَبَ]{.ar} [Hasaba]{.trn} "he computed"
+ [حَسِبَ]{.ar} [Hasiba]{.trn} "He deemed"

//Every verb needs a noun that does the action of the verb. This noun is called the _doer_. 

## Verbs with noun doers

When a verb is in a sentence, it requires a doer. A doer is a noun or a pronoun that does the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence "The boy went.", the noun "the boy" is the doer of the verb.

### Verbs with a masculine doer noun

Consider the sentence:

"The boy went." 

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy went." 

[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "went" is the verb and [ٱلْغُلَامُ]{.ar} [algulAmu]{.trn} "the boy" is the doer. Note that in English the doer comes before the verb whereas in Arabic the doer comes after the verb.

The basic form of the verb [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} is specifically for masculine doers. We shall see in the next section how the verb is modified for feminine doers. 

The doer may be definite, indefinite, a common noun, or a proper noun. Examples:

A boy went.

Muhammad went.

The time went.

### Verbs with a feminine doer noun

Now consider the sentence:

"A girl went." 

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatun]{.trn}  
"A girl went." 

Note that we have modified the verb by adding on the letter [تْ]{.ar} at the end. This [تْ]{.ar} is to indicate that the doer is feminine and is called the [تْ]{.ar} of femininity. If the word following the noun begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} then we add a helper vowel to the [تْ]{.ar} and it becomes [تِ]{.ar}. Examples:

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْبَقَرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -lbaqaratu.]{.trn}  
"The cow went."

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -mraEatun.]{.trn}  
"A woman went."

Note that whether or not we add a helper vowel to [تْ]{.ar}, the letter before it always has an [a]{.trn}-mark.

## Verbs with direct doees

Consider the sentence:

"The man wrote a book."

In this sentence, "wrote" is the verb, "the man" is the doer, and "a book" is what we shall call the _doee_. In fact, it is what we shall call a _direct doee_. A doee is the noun to whom the action of verb is done. In Arabic, we will express this by saying:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrajulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

Note how in Arabic the doee [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" is in the a-state. This is because, in Arabic, verbs shall cause a direct doee to be in the a-state. This is true whether the direct doee is definite or indefinite. Here is another example:

[ضَرَبَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabati -lmarEatu -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"The woman hit the girl."

Note again how [ٱلْجَارِيَةَ]{.ar} [aljAriyata]{.trn} "the girl" is in the a-state because it is a direct doee.

We will learn about _indirect doees_ in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, once we have studied prepositions.

### Indirect doees

// Move this section to prepositions chapter.

Some verbs instead of taking a direct doee, take an _indirect doee_. This too is a noun that the action of the verb is done to. However, it is preceded by a preposition. In this case, the indirect doee shall not be in the a-state. Rather it shall be in the i-state because is preceded by the preposition. For example,


By the way, it is entirely possible that an English verb may take a direct doee, while the corresponding Arabic verb may only take an indirect doee. The reverse is also quite possible. For example,

[غَفَرَ ٱللَّـٰهُ لِلْمُسْلِمِ.]{.ar}  
[gafara -llAhu -lmuslimi.]{.trn}  
"[#allAh]{.trn2} forgave the Muslim."

It is also possible that an English verb may take an indirect doee with a particular preposition whereas the corresponding Arabic verb may take the indirect doee with a different preposition. For example,

[غَضِبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ مِنَ ٱلْغُلَامِ.]{.ar}  
[gaDiba -rrajulu mina -lgulAmi.]{.trn}  
"The man was angry with the boy."

## Verbs with doer pronouns

A pronoun may replace a noun as the doer of a verb. For example, "he went", "I wrote", etc. In Arabic, doer pronouns are either visible or invisible.

In Arabic, visible doer pronouns exist for "I" and "you". "You" is differentiated for masculine and feminine doers whereas "I" is not. Visible doer pronouns are attached to the basic form of the verb while modifying the vowel on the final letter of the verb. For example,

Doer pronoun | Verb | Transcription | Meaning
:---|:---|:---|:---
[تُ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتُ]{.ar} | [pahabtu]{.trn} | "I went"
[تَ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتَ]{.ar} | [pahabta]{.trn} | "You~masc.~ went"
[تِ]{.ar} |[ذَهَبْتِ]{.ar} | [pahabti]{.trn} | "You~fem.~ went"

The remaining singular doer pronouns: "he" and "she" are invisible in Arabic. So if we wish to say "He went." we will simply say:

[ذَهَبَ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba.]{.trn}  
"He went."

And for "She went." we will say:

[ذَهَبَتْ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat.]{.trn}  
"She went."

Take care to note that doer pronouns modify the final letter of the basic verb, whereas the [تْ]{.ar} of "she" or feminine doer nouns does not. So make sure you see the difference in the following two sentences:

[ضَرَبْتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabti -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"You~fem.~ hit the girl."

[ضَرَبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.]{.ar}  
[Darabati -ljAriyata.]{.trn}  
"She hit the girl."

## Verbs with doee pronouns

Just like doer nouns may be replaced with doer pronouns, doee nouns may too be replaced with _doee pronouns_. Doee pronouns are also attached to the end of the verb, while not modifying the vowel on the final letter of the verb. The doee pronouns are:

Doee pronoun | Transcription | Meaning
:---|:---|:---
[هُ]{.ar}  | [-hu]{.trn} | "him"
[هَا]{.ar} | [-hA]{.trn} | "her"
[كَ]{.ar}  | [-ka]{.trn} | "you~masc.~"
[كِ]{.ar}  | [-ki]{.trn} | "you~fem.~"
[ي]{.ar}  | [-I]{.trn}  | "me"

Here are some notes regarding their usage:

Doee pronouns shall always be attached to the verb. So if there is a doer noun then it shall be placed after the attached doee pronoun. For example:

[سَأَلَهُ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[saEalahu -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy asked him."

If however, the doer is also a pronoun, then it shall be attached first to the verb and then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the doer pronoun. For example,

[سَأَلْتُكِ.]{.ar}  
[saEaltuki.]{.trn}  
"I asked you~fem.~."

If the doer pronoun is invisible, then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the verb again directly with only a possible [تْ]{.ar} of femininity intervening. For example:

[سَأَلَهَا.]{.ar}  
[saEalahA.]{.trn}  
"He asked her."

[سَأَلَتْكَ.]{.ar}  
[saEalatka.]{.trn}  
"She asked you~masc.~."

If the doee pronoun [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn} "him" is preceded by the vowels [i]{.trn}, [I]{.trn}, or [ay]{.trn} then it shall instead become [هِ]{.ar} [hi]{.trn} with no change in meaning. For example,

[سَأَلْتِهِ.]{.ar}  
[saEaltihi]{.trn}  
"You~fem.~ asked him."

The doee pronoun [ي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn} "me" is always attached to the verb following an invervening [نِ]{.ar}. For example,

[سَأَلَنِي.]{.ar}  
[saEalanI.]{.trn}  
"He asked me."

So why don't we simply say that the doee pronoun for "me" is [نِي]{.ar} [nI]{.trn}? This is because these same doee pronouns are also attached to nouns and prepositions as we shall see in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, and in those cases there is no intervening [نِ]{.ar}.

## Order of words in a sentence

### Changing the order of words for emphasis

In Arabic, the doer always follows the verb. So the normal order of a sentence is verb-doer-doee. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

However, we will often come across sentences like:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kataba kitAban.]{.trn}

It may appear as if [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} is the doer and it is coming before the verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn}. But actually, this is a subject-information sentence. 

Here [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} "the man" is the subject of the sentence, and [كَتَبَ كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kataba kitAban.]{.trn} "he wrote a book" is the information about the subject. So the translation of the sentence is technically:

"The man, he wrote a book."

However, this is an awkward sentence in English so we will translate it as "The man wrote a book." But this is also the translation of:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

So why then would we say [ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [Earrujulu kataba kitAban.]{.trn} instead of the more normal [كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [kataba -rrujulu kitAban.]{.trn}? The answer is that this change in the sentence's word order is done in order to give more emphasis to the doer, as if to say:

"_The man_ wrote a book."

So in Arabic, the order of words is generally more flexible than in English and this is often used to give emphasis to certain words.

### Indefinite doers

If a verb's doer is an indefinite noun, it is often, but not always, placed at the end of the sentence. This too is for emphasis. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ رَجُلٌ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -lkitAba rajulun.]{.trn}  
"A man wrote the book."

### Multiple verbs for one doer

In a sentence that has multiple verbs separated by "and", normally one of them is placed before the doer and the rest after it. For example,

[أَكَلَ ٱلرَّجُلُ وَشَرِبَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -rrajulu wacariba.]{.trn}  
"The man ate and drank."

## Separating doee pronouns from the verb

We have mentioned that doee pronouns are attached to the verb. Sometimes there is a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb. When separating the doee pronoun from the verb, it is instead attached to the prefix [إِيَّا]{.ar} [EiyyA]{.trn}. So then we get the following doee pronouns:

1. [إِيَّاهُ]{.ar} [EiyyAhu]{.trn} "him".
2. [إِيَّاهَا]{.ar} [EiyyAhA]{.trn} "her".
3. [إِيَّاكَ]{.ar} [EiyyAka]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
4. [إِيَّاكِ]{.ar} [EiyyAki]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
5. [إِيَّايَ]{.ar} [EiyyAya]{.trn} "me (masc. & fem)". Note that an [a]{.trn}-mark is placed on the [ي]{.ar}.

But why is there a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb? This can occur for a couple of reasons:

i. If there are multiple doee pronouns, only one of them can be attached to the verb. Example,

   [ضَرَبَتْنِي وَإِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
   [DarabatnI wa EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  
   "She hit me and him."

ii. If the doee is placed before the verb for emphasis. Example,

    [إِيَّايَ ضَرَبَتْ.]{.ar}  
    [EiyyAya Darabat.]{.trn}  
    "She hit _me_."
