# Prepositions

Prepositions are words like "in", "on", "at", etc. 

We saw that nouns can be definite or indefinite, they can be preceded by [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} or ended with an [n]{.trn}-mark, and that they can have three states (u-state, a-state, and i-state). Prepositions do not have these properties.

Prepositions come before a noun and put it in the i-state. For example the preposition [فِي]{.ar} [fI]{.trn} means "in". We can put it before the noun [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house":

[فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[fI baytin]{.trn}  
"in a house"

Note how the noun [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} "a house" is in the i-state because of the [in]{.trn}-mark under the  [tAE]{.trn} [تٍ]{.ar}.

Arabic has two types of prepositions: _true_ prepositions and _pseudo_-prepositions.

## True prepositions

Here is a list of the more common true prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[فِي]{.ar}  |[fI]{.trn}   | in
[بِ]{.ar}   |[bi]{.trn}   | with, by, next to
[ل]{.ar}   |[li]{.trn}   | for
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} |[ealA]{.trn} | on
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} |[EilA]{.trn} | to
[مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
[عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about
[كَ]{.ar}   |[ka]{.trn}   | like

Notes:

+ Prepositions that are a single letter (like 
[بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn}, [ل]{.ar} [li]{.trn}, [كَ]{.ar} [ka]{.trn}) are joined to the following noun in writing. Example:
  
  [بِقَلَمٍ]{.ar}  
  [biqalamin]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

  [لِرَجُلٍ]{.ar}  
  [lirajulin]{.trn}  
  "for a man"

  [كَٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [ka-mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "like a woman"

+ When a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the preposition is generally joined to the [alif]{.trn} in the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. The [alif]{.trn} is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}). Example:

  [بِٱلْقَلَمِ]{.ar}  
  [bi-lqalami]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

+ The only exception is the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}. When joined to a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the [alif]{.trn} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} is dropped and we write two [lAm]{.trn}s together. Example:

  [لِلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
  [li-rrajuli]{.trn}  
  "for the man"

  However, if the noun too starts with a [lAm]{.trn}, then we drop the entire [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. This way we don't have three [lAm]{.trn}s joined to each other. Example:

  [ٱَللُّعْبَةُ]{.ar}  
  [Ealluebatu]{.trn}  
  "the toy"

  becomes

  [لِلُّعْبَةِ]{.ar}  
  [li-lluebati]{.trn}  
  "for the toy"

+ The prepositions 
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} [ealA]{.trn} "on" and
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [EilA]{.trn} "to" have a long-[A]{.trn} vowel at the end but it is written with a [yAE]{.trn} [ىٰ]{.ar} instead of an [alif]{.trn}. (We have already learned that some words are written this way.)

+ Prepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:

  [إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [EilA madrasatin]{.trn}  
  "to a school"

+ If a preposition ends with a long vowel, then (just like other words that end with long vowels), when it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, the ending is pronounced as a short vowel that connects to the following word.. Examples:

  [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
  "in the house"

  [إِلَى ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [Eila -mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "to a woman"

+ If a preposition ends with a round mark [◌ْ ]{.ar} and it is followed by a word that begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, then the round mark is changed to a short vowel according to the following rules:

  + The ending of the preposition [عَنْ]{.ar} [ean]{.trn} gets an [i]{.trn}-mark and becomes [عَنِ]{.ar} [eani]{.trn}. Examples:
    
    [عَنِ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [eani -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "about the man"

    [عَنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [eani -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "about the woman"

  + The ending of the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar}  [min]{.trn} gets an [a]{.trn}-mark if followed by the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} of a definite noun. Otherwise it gets an [i]{.trn}-mark if followed by any other connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:

    [مِنَ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [mina -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "from the man"

    [مِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [mini -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "from the woman"

## Pseudo-prepositions

Pseudo-prepositions behave just like true prepositions. They are called pseudo-prepositions because they are actually nouns. When used as nouns (as we will see later if Allah wills), they may be definite or indefinite, and can have a state, like other nouns. But as prepositions they are similar in behavior to true prepositions.

Here is a list of some common pseudo-prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[عِنْدَ]{.ar} | [einda]{.trn} | at
[مَعَ]{.ar}  | [maea]{.trn}  | together with
[فَوْقَ]{.ar} | [fawqa]{.trn} | above
[تَحْتَ]{.ar} | [taHta]{.trn} | below
[قَبْلَ]{.ar} | [qabla]{.trn} | before
[بَعْدَ]{.ar} | [baeda]{.trn} | after
[أَمَامَ]{.ar}| [EamAma]{.trn}| in front of
[خَلْفَ]{.ar} | [xalfa]{.trn} | behind
[بَيْنَ]{.ar} | [bayna]{.trn} | between

Here are some examples using pseudo-prepositions:

## Meaning of prepositions and translating them

For each preposition that we have listed above, we have also given its meaning. For example,

+ [فِي]{.ar}[fI]{.trn} "in"
+ [بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn} "with", "by", "next to"

These meanings are not always fixed. And there is some degree of overlap in meanings as well. For example, in order to say "in the city" we will usually say
[فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ]{.ar}[fi -lmadInati]{.trn} but sometimes we can also say
[بِٱلْمَدِينَةِ]{.ar} [bi -lmadInati]{.trn} with the same meaning. As you keep learning, practicing, and reading Arabic, you will learn how to choose which preposition to use.

We will also see that English often uses one preposition to express a meaning, while Arabic will use another preposition to express the same meaning. For example, in English we say "angry _with_".  But Arabic usually uses the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} [min]{.trn} "from" with [غَاضِبٌ]{.ar} [gADibun]{.trn} "angry" instead of using [بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn} "with". So in Arabic we would say [غَاضِبٌ مِنْ]{.ar} [gADibun min]{.trn} but we will still translate it as "angry with". This usage is idiomatic, and as you keep learning you will learn which prepositions to use in which circumstances.

## Sentences and phrases with prepositions

We have seen how a noun can be used after a preposition to get a prepositional phrase, for example:

[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"in the house"

We can put an indefinite noun in front of this structure:

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"a man in the house"

Note that the preposition has no effect on the state of the noun it. In this case, it is in the u-state. Only the noun after the preposition is put in the i-state.

We can also put a definite noun in front of the prepositional phrase. Now the resulting structure can have two meanings. For example,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"The man is in the house." OR "the man in the house"

The second meaning "the man in the house" will typically only be valid when the pstructure is part of a larger sentence. For example, "He met _the man in the house_."

We haven't learned verbs like "met" in Arabic yet so we won't give this sentence in Arabic right now. But hopefully, you can appreciate how the the structure "the man in the house" is part of a larger sentence.

By the way, the first meaning can also be valid as part of a larger sentence. For example, "He said that _the man is in the house_".

Don't worry right now about how to identify which meaning is intended. Usually it will be clear from the context. And sometimes the nouns and prepositions used will only easily support one meaning. This will also be clear from the sentence and the context.

### A sentence with an indefinite noun and a prepositional phrase

We have learned how to say "The man is in the house".
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"The man is in the house."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "the man" is the subject of the sentence, and 
[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  "in the house" is the information. In this sentence, the subject is a definite noun.

Can we now say this sentence with an indefinite subject? For example, "A man is in the house.:w



"The man is in the house."
### To have

inda, maea, li


[هَٰذَا هَـٰذَا]{.ar}

### pseudo

## State of noun after prep

### adjectives 

## phrases and sentences

### indef phrase only

### Def phrase or sentence

A preposition and following noun after a definite noun will usually be a sentence with a subject and information. For example

[الكتاب في الحقيبة]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati]{.trn}  
The book is in the bag.

However, sometimes it is possible that the whole structure (noun+prep+noun) can be a phrase:

[الكتاب في الحقيبة ثقيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati vaqIlun]{.trn}  
The book in the bag is heavy.

This doesn't work for all prepositions and nouns in all cases. Only if the meaning is correct.

(noun+li+noun) is unlikely to be a phrase.
