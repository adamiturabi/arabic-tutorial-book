# Prepositions

Prepositions are words like "in", "on", "at", etc. 

We saw that nouns can be definite or indefinite, they can be preceded by [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} or ended with an [n]{.trn}-mark, and that they can have three states (u-state, a-state, and i-state). Prepositions do not have these properties.

Prepositions come before a noun and put it in the i-state. For example the preposition [فِي]{.ar} [fI]{.trn} means "in". We can put it before the noun [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house":

[فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[fI baytin]{.trn}  
"in a house"

Note how the noun [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} "a house" is in the i-state because of the [in]{.trn}-mark under the  [tAE]{.trn} [تٍ]{.ar}.

Arabic has two types of prepositions: _true_ prepositions and _pseudo_-prepositions.

## True prepositions

Here is a list of the more common true prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[فِي]{.ar}  |[fI]{.trn}   | in
[بِ]{.ar}   |[bi]{.trn}   | with, by
[ل]{.ar}   |[li]{.trn}   | for
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} |[ealA]{.trn} | on
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} |[EilA]{.trn} | to
[مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
[عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about
[كَ]{.ar}   |[ka]{.trn}   | like

Notes:

+ Prepositions that are a single letter (like 
[بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn}, [ل]{.ar} [li]{.trn}, [كَ]{.ar} [ka]{.trn}) are joined to the following noun in writing. Example:
  
  [بِقَلَمٍ]{.ar}  
  [biqalamin]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

  [لِرَجُلٍ]{.ar}  
  [lirajulin]{.trn}  
  "for a man"

  [كَٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [ka-mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "like a woman"

+ When a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the preposition is generally joined to the [alif]{.trn} in the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. The [alif]{.trn} is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}). Example:

  [بِٱلْقَلَمِ]{.ar}  
  [bi-lqalami]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

+ The only exception is the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}. When joined to a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the [alif]{.trn} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} is dropped and we write two [lAm]{.trn}s together. Example:

  [لِلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
  [li-rrajuli]{.trn}  
  "for the man"

  However, if the noun too starts with a [lAm]{.trn}, then we drop the entire [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. This way we don't have three [lAm]{.trn}s joined to each other. Example:

  [ٱَللُّعْبَةُ]{.ar}  
  [Ealluebatu]{.trn}  
  "the toy"

  becomes

  [لِلُّعْبَةِ]{.ar}  
  [li-lluebati]{.trn}  
  "for the toy"

+ The prepositions 
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} [ealA]{.trn} "on" and
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [EilA]{.trn} "to" have a long-[A]{.trn} vowel at the end but it is written with a [yAE]{.trn} [ىٰ]{.ar} instead of an [alif]{.trn}. (We have already learned that some words are written this way.)

+ Prepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:

  [إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [EilA madrasatin]{.trn}  
  "to a school"

+ If a preposition ends with a long vowel, then (just like other words that end with long vowels), when it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, the ending is pronounced as a short vowel that connects to the following word.. Examples:

  [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
  "in the house"

  [إِلَى ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [Eila -mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "to a woman"

+ If a preposition ends with a round mark [◌ْ ]{.ar} and it is followed by a word that begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, then the round mark is changed to a short vowel according to the following rules:

  + The ending of the preposition [عَنْ]{.ar} [ean]{.trn} gets an [i]{.trn}-mark and becomes [عَنِ]{.ar} [eani]{.trn}. Examples:
    
    [عَنِ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [eani -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "about the man"

    [عَنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [eani -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "about the woman"

  + The ending of the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar}  [min]{.trn} gets an [a]{.trn}-mark if followed by the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} of a definite noun. Otherwise it gets an [i]{.trn}-mark if followed by any other connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:

    [مِنَ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [mina -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "from the man"

    [مِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [mini -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "from the woman"

## Pseudo-prepositions

Pseudo-prepositions behave just like true prepositions. They are called pseudo-prepositions because they are actually nouns. When used as nouns (as we will see later if Allah wills), they may be definite or indefinite, and can have a state, like other nouns. But as prepositions they are similar in behavior to true prepositions.

Here is a list of some common pseudo-prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[عِنْدَ]{.ar} | [einda]{.trn} | at
[مَعَ]{.ar}  | [maea]{.trn}  | together with
[فَوْقَ]{.ar} | [fawqa]{.trn} | above
[تَحْتَ]{.ar} | [taHta]{.trn} | below
[قَبْلَ]{.ar} | [qabla]{.trn} | before
[بَعْدَ]{.ar} | [baeda]{.trn} | after

Here are some examples using pseudo-prepositions:

## Meaning of prepositions and translating them

For each preposition that we have listed above, we have also given its meaning. For example,

+ [فِي]{.ar}[fI]{.trn} "in"
+ [بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn} "with", "by"
+ [مَعَ]{.ar} [maea]{.trn}"together with"

These meanings are not always fixed. And there is some degree of overlap in meanings as well. For example, in order to say "in a city" we can use either 
[فِي]{.ar}[fI]{.trn} or
[بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn}
In some contexts one will be preferred over another.
When we translate sentences that have prepositions from Arabic to English, we may use different pr

[فِي]{.ar}  |[fI]{.trn}   | in
[بِ]{.ar}   |[bi]{.trn}   | with, by
[ل]{.ar}   |[li]{.trn}   | for
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} |[ealA]{.trn} | on
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} |[EilA]{.trn} | to
[مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
[عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about



[هَٰذَا هَـٰذَا]{.ar}

### pseudo

## State of noun after prep

### adjectives 

## phrases and sentences

### indef phrase only

### Def phrase or sentence

A preposition and following noun after a definite noun will usually be a sentence with a subject and information. For example

[الكتاب في الحقيبة]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati]{.trn}  
The book is in the bag.

However, sometimes it is possible that the whole structure (noun+prep+noun) can be a phrase:

[الكتاب في الحقيبة ثقيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati vaqIlun]{.trn}  
The book in the bag is heavy.

This doesn't work for all prepositions and nouns in all cases. Only if the meaning is correct.

(noun+li+noun) is unlikely to be a phrase.
