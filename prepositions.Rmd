# Prepositions

## General

Prepositions come before a noun and put it in the i-state. For example [فِي]{.ar} [fI]{.trn} means "in". We can put it before the noun [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house":

[فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[fI baytin]{.trn}  
"in a house"

Note house the noun [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} "a house" is in the i-state because of the [in]{.trn}-mark under the  [tAE]{.trn} [تٍ]{.ar}.

Here is a list of the more common prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[فِي]{.ar}  |[fI]{.trn}   | in
[بِ]{.ar}   |[bi]{.trn}   | with, at
[ل]{.ar}   |[li]{.trn}   | for
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} |[ealA]{.trn} | on
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} |[EilA]{.trn} | to
[مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
[كَ]{.ar}   |[ka]{.trn}   | like
[عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about

Notes:

+ Prepositions that are a single letter (like 
[بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn}, [ل]{.ar} [li]{.trn}, [كَ]{.ar} [ka]{.trn}) are joined to the following noun. Example:
  
  [بِقَلَمٍ]{.ar}  
  [biqalamin]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

  [لِرَجُلٍ]{.ar}  
  [lirajulin]{.trn}  
  "for a man"

  [كَٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [ka-mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "like a woman"

+ When a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the preposition is generally joined to the [alif]{.trn} in the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. The [alif]{.trn} is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}). Example:

  [بِٱلْقَلَمِ]{.ar}  
  [bi-lqalami]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

+ The only exception is the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}. When joined to a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the [alif]{.trn} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} is dropped and we write two [lAm]{.trn}s together. Example:

  [لِلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
  [li-rrajuli]{.trn}  
  "for the man"

  However, the noun too starts with a [lAm]{.trn}, then we drop the entire [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. This way we don't have three [lAm]{.trn}s joined to each other. Example:

  [ٱَللُّعْبَةُ]{.ar}  
  [Ealluebatu]{.trn}  
  "the toy"

  [لِلُّعْبَةِ]{.ar}  
  [li-lluebati]{.trn}  
  "for the toy"

+ The prepositions end with yaa instead of alif

+ Prepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:

  [إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [EilA madrasatin]{.trn}  
  "to a school"

+ If a preposition ends with a long vowel, then the ending is prornounced as a short vowel if it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:

  [إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ]{.ar}  
  [Eila -lmadrasati]{.trn}  
  "to the school"

+ 




### pseudo

## State of noun after prep

### adjectives 

## phrases and sentences

### indef phrase only

### Def phrase or sentence

A preposition and following noun after a definite noun will usually be a sentence with a subject and information. For example

[الكتاب في الحقيبة]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati]{.trn}  
The book is in the bag.

However, sometimes it is possible that the whole structure (noun+prep+noun) can be a phrase:

[الكتاب في الحقيبة ثقيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati vaqIlun]{.trn}  
The book in the bag is heavy.

This doesn't work for all prepositions and nouns in all cases. Only if the meaning is correct.

(noun+li+noun) is unlikely to be a phrase.
