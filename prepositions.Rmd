# Prepositions

Prepositions are words like "in", "on", "at", etc. 

We saw that nouns can be definite or indefinite, they can be preceded by [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} or ended with an [n]{.trn}-mark, and that they can have three states (u-state, a-state, and i-state). Prepositions do not have these properties.

Prepositions come before a noun and put it in the i-state. For example the preposition [فِي]{.ar} [fI]{.trn} means "in". We can put it before the noun [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house":

[فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[fI baytin]{.trn}  
"in a house"

Note how the noun [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} "a house" is in the i-state because of the [in]{.trn}-mark under the  [tAE]{.trn} [تٍ]{.ar}.

Arabic has two types of prepositions: _true_ prepositions and _pseudo_-prepositions.

## True prepositions

Here is a list of the more common true prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[فِي]{.ar}  |[fI]{.trn}   | in
[بِ]{.ar}   |[bi]{.trn}   | with, by, next to
[ل]{.ar}   |[li]{.trn}   | for
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} |[ealA]{.trn} | on
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} |[EilA]{.trn} | to
[مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
[عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about
[كَ]{.ar}   |[ka]{.trn}   | like

Notes:

+ Prepositions that are a single letter (like 
[بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn}, [ل]{.ar} [li]{.trn}, [كَ]{.ar} [ka]{.trn}) are joined to the following noun in writing. Example:
  
  [بِقَلَمٍ]{.ar}  
  [biqalamin]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

  [لِرَجُلٍ]{.ar}  
  [lirajulin]{.trn}  
  "for a man"

  [كَٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [ka-mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "like a woman"

+ When a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the preposition is generally joined to the [alif]{.trn} in the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. The [alif]{.trn} is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}). Example:

  [بِٱلْقَلَمِ]{.ar}  
  [bi-lqalami]{.trn}  
  "with a pen"

+ The only exception is the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}. When joined to a definite noun with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}, the [alif]{.trn} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} is dropped and we write two [lAm]{.trn}s together. Example:

  [لِلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
  [li-rrajuli]{.trn}  
  "for the man"

  However, if the noun too starts with a [lAm]{.trn}, then we drop the entire [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn}. This way we don't have three [lAm]{.trn}s joined to each other. Example:

  [ٱَللُّعْبَةُ]{.ar}  
  [Ealluebatu]{.trn}  
  "the toy"

  becomes

  [لِلُّعْبَةِ]{.ar}  
  [li-lluebati]{.trn}  
  "for the toy"

+ The prepositions 
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} [ealA]{.trn} "on" and
[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [EilA]{.trn} "to" have a long-[A]{.trn} vowel at the end but it is written with a [yAE]{.trn} [ىٰ]{.ar} instead of an [alif]{.trn}. (We have already learned that some words are written this way.)

+ Prepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:

  [إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [EilA madrasatin]{.trn}  
  "to a school"

+ If a preposition ends with a long vowel, then (just like other words that end with long vowels), when it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, the ending is pronounced as a short vowel that connects to the following word.. Examples:

  [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
  "in the house"

  [إِلَى ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
  [Eila -mraEatin]{.trn}  
  "to a woman"

+ If a preposition ends with a round mark [◌ْ ]{.ar} and it is followed by a word that begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}, then the round mark is changed to a short vowel according to the following rules:

  + The ending of the preposition [عَنْ]{.ar} [ean]{.trn} gets an [i]{.trn}-mark and becomes [عَنِ]{.ar} [eani]{.trn}. Examples:
    
    [عَنِ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [eani -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "about the man"

    [عَنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [eani -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "about the woman"

  + The ending of the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar}  [min]{.trn} gets an [a]{.trn}-mark if followed by the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} of a definite noun. Otherwise it gets an [i]{.trn}-mark if followed by any other connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:

    [مِنَ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
    [mina -rrajuli]{.trn}  
    "from the man"

    [مِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar}  
    [mini -mraEatin]{.trn}  
    "from the woman"

## Pseudo-prepositions

Pseudo-prepositions behave just like true prepositions. They are called pseudo-prepositions because they are actually nouns. When used as nouns (as we will see later if Allah wills), they may be definite or indefinite, and can have a state, like other nouns. But as prepositions they are similar in behavior to true prepositions.

Here is a list of some common pseudo-prepositions:

Preposition | Transcription | Meaning
:-------|:-------|:-------------
[عِنْدَ]{.ar} | [einda]{.trn} | at
[مَعَ]{.ar}  | [maea]{.trn}  | together with
[فَوْقَ]{.ar} | [fawqa]{.trn} | above
[تَحْتَ]{.ar} | [taHta]{.trn} | below
[قَبْلَ]{.ar} | [qabla]{.trn} | before
[بَعْدَ]{.ar} | [baeda]{.trn} | after
[أَمَامَ]{.ar}| [EamAma]{.trn}| in front of
[خَلْفَ]{.ar} | [xalfa]{.trn} | behind
[بَيْنَ]{.ar} | [bayna]{.trn} | between

Here are some examples using pseudo-prepositions:

...

The preposition [عِنْدَ]{.ar} [einda]{.trn} "at" can be used with a person to mean  "the place of the person". For example

[عِنْدَ ٱلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}  
[einda -rrajuli]{.trn}  

can be used to mean "at the man's [house, etc]."

bayna repeated

## Meaning of prepositions and translating them

For each preposition that we have listed above, we have also given its meaning. For example,

+ [فِي]{.ar}[fI]{.trn} "in"
+ [بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn} "with", "by", "next to"

These meanings are not always fixed. And there is some degree of overlap in meanings as well. For example, in order to say "in the city" we will usually say
[فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ]{.ar}[fi -lmadInati]{.trn} but sometimes we can also say
[بِٱلْمَدِينَةِ]{.ar} [bi -lmadInati]{.trn} with the same meaning. As you keep learning, practicing, and reading Arabic, you will learn how to choose which preposition to use, if Allah wills.

Similarly, sometimes we have two or more prepositions with almost the same meaning. For example,

+ [مِنْ]{.ar}  |[min]{.trn}  | from
+ [عَنْ]{.ar}  |[ean]{.trn}  | from, about

Knowing which one is used where will also take practice.

We will also see that English often uses one preposition to express a meaning, while Arabic will use another preposition to express the same meaning. For example, in English we say "angry _with_".  But Arabic usually uses the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} [min]{.trn} "from" with [غَاضِبٌ]{.ar} [gADibun]{.trn} "angry" instead of using [بِ]{.ar} [bi]{.trn} "with". So in Arabic we would say [غَاضِبٌ مِنْ]{.ar} [gADibun min]{.trn} but we will still translate it as "angry with". This usage is idiomatic, and as you keep learning you will learn which prepositions to use in which circumstances.

## Sentences and phrases with prepositions

We have seen how a noun can be used after a preposition to get a prepositional phrase, for example:

[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"in the house"

We can put an indefinite noun in front of this structure:

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"a man in the house"

Note that the preposition has no effect on the state of the noun it. In this case, it is in the u-state. Only the noun after the preposition is put in the i-state.

We can also put a definite noun in front of the prepositional phrase. Now the resulting structure can have two meanings. For example,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"The man is in the house." OR "the man in the house"

The second meaning "the man in the house" will typically only be valid when the pstructure is part of a larger sentence. For example, "He met _the man in the house_."

We haven't learned verbs like "met" in Arabic yet so we won't give this sentence in Arabic right now. But hopefully, you can appreciate how the the structure "the man in the house" is part of a larger sentence.

By the way, the first meaning can also be valid as part of a larger sentence. For example, "He said that _the man is in the house_".

Don't worry right now about how to identify which meaning is intended. Usually it will be clear from the context. And sometimes the nouns and prepositions used will only easily support one meaning. This will also be clear from the sentence and the context.

## A sentence with an indefinite noun and a prepositional phrase

We have learned how to say "The man is in the house".

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"The man is in the house."

The definite noun [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrajulu]{.trn} "the man" is the subject of the sentence, and 
[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  "in the house" is the information. 

Can we now say this sentence with an indefinite subject? For example, "A man is in the house."

We can't say

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  

because this only means "a man in the house", not "A man is in the house.".

As we've said before, sentences with indefinite subjects are not straightforward in Arabic. But actually this case, they're not too complicated. To express this sentence in Arabic, we put the information
[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  [fi -lbayti]{.trn}  "in the house" before the subject [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man":

[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[fi -lbayti rajulun]{.trn}  
"A man is in the house."

By the way, in English we usually express this sentence as "There is a man in the house." In Arabic, however, we will use the same sentence
[فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}
[fi -lbayti rajulun]{.trn}
as a translation.

## To have something

English uses the word "have" or "has" to express that someone 
Arabic does not have a word for "have" or "has". In order to express sentences like

"I have a book."  
"The boy has a father."  

Arabic uses prepositions like 

+ [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} "for"
+ [عِنْدَ]{.ar} [einda]{.trn} "at"
+ [لَدَىٰ]{.ar} [ladA]{.trn} "at"
+ [مَعَ]{.ar} [maea]{.trn} "together with"

Here are some examples:

[لِلْغُلَامِ أَبٌ]{.ar}  
[li -lgulAmi Eabun]{.trn}
"The boy has a father." (literally "For the boy is a father.")

[عِنْدَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
[einda -rrajuli kitAbun]{.trn}  
"The man has a book." (literally "At the man is a book.")

[مَعَ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ لُعْبَةٌ]{.ar}  
[maea -ljAriyati luebatun]{.trn}  
"The girl has a toy." (literally "With the girl is a toy.")

Here are some notes that can help you choose which preposition to use to express "has" or "have":

+ [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} "for" is used to express personal relationships, like "I have a friend", "I have a son", etc. It is also used when you wish to imply that you own the object. For example, the sentence

  [لِلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
  [li -rrajuli kitAbun]{.trn}  

  implies that the man owns a book. But it is possible that he has lent it to someone else so he does not actually have it on his person or at his house, etc.

+ [عِنْدَ]{.ar} [einda]{.trn} "at" is used to express that the person has the object in his possession, but not necessarily that he has it with him right now. For example the sentence

  [عِنْدَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
  [einda -rrajuli kitAbun]{.trn}  

  implies that the man has a book in his possession. But it is possible that it may not be with him right now. It may be at his house or elsewhere.

+ [لَدَىٰ]{.ar} [ladA]{.trn} "at" is used to express that the person has the object in his possession and that he has it with him right now. For example the sentence

  [لَدَى ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
  [lada -rrajuli kitAbun]{.trn}  

  implies that the man has a book in his possession and that he has it with him right now.

+ [مَعَ]{.ar} [maea]{.trn} "together with" is used to express that the person has the object with him right now. But it doesn't necessarily imply ownership. For example, the sentence 

  [مَعَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
  [maea -rrajuli kitAbun]{.trn}  

  means that the man has a book with him right now. But it is possible that he does not own it and that someone else has lent it to him.

There is some degree of overlap in meaning and you will get a feeling of which preposition is more appropriate in which circumstance as you progress in your learning, if Allah wills. For now, if you find that the object can be used with all of these prepositions, you might go with [عِنْدَ]{.ar} [einda]{.trn} as it is more commonly used.

## Adjectives with prepositional phrases

### Adjective separated from described noun

usually for indefinite
kitabun fi -lHaqIbati vaqIlun
"a book in the bag which is heavy"
OR
"a heavy book in the bag"

inda, maea, li


[هَٰذَا هَـٰذَا]{.ar}

### pseudo

## State of noun after prep

### adjectives 

## phrases and sentences

### indef phrase only

### Def phrase or sentence

A preposition and following noun after a definite noun will usually be a sentence with a subject and information. For example

[الكتاب في الحقيبة]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati]{.trn}  
The book is in the bag.

However, sometimes it is possible that the whole structure (noun+prep+noun) can be a phrase:

[الكتاب في الحقيبة ثقيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu fi -lHaqIbati vaqIlun]{.trn}  
The book in the bag is heavy.

This doesn't work for all prepositions and nouns in all cases. Only if the meaning is correct.

(noun+li+noun) is unlikely to be a phrase.
