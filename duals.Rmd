# Duals

## Introduction

English has only a singular and a plural nouns. For any number greater than one, English uses the plural. For example,

"One house, two houses, three houses, etc."

On the other hand, Arabic uses the plural only for nouns in number three and higher. For nouns that are two in number Arabic uses the _dual_.

## Forming the dual

The dual is formed by appending [ـَانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} when the noun is in the u-state and [ـَانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. Example:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "a house"  | [بَيْتٌ]{.ar}<br>[baytun]{.trn}| [بَيْتًا]{.ar}<br>[baytan]{.trn} |[بَيْتٍا]{.ar}<br>[baytin]{.trn} | 
| "two houses"  | [بَيْتَانِ]{.ar}<br>[baytAni]{.trn}| [بَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[baytayni]{.trn} | [بَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[baytayni]{.trn} |

Note that there are no [n]{.trn} marks for the dual. Definite dual nouns are also formed in the same way:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "the house"  | [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar}<br>[Ealbaytu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْبَيْتَ]{.ar}<br>[Ealbayta]{.trn} |[ٱَلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}<br>[Ealbayti]{.trn} | 
| "the two houses"  | [ٱَلْبَيْتَانِ]{.ar}<br>[EalbaytAni]{.trn}| [ٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[Ealbaytayni]{.trn} | [ٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[Ealbaytayni]{.trn} |

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is converted to a regular [tAE]{.trn} [ت]{.ar} before appending the dual suffix:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "a tree"  | [شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[cajaratun]{.trn}| [شَجَرَةً]{.ar}<br>[cajaratan]{.trn} |[شَجَرَةٍ]{.ar}<br>[cajaratin]{.trn} | 
| "two trees"  | [شَجَرَتَانِ]{.ar}<br>[cajaratAni]{.trn}| [شَجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[cajaratayni]{.trn} | [شَجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar}<br>[cajaratayni]{.trn} |

Note that if a feminine noun does not have a looped [tAE]{.trn} then it will simply be appended with [ـَانِ]{.ar} or [ـَيْنِ]{.ar}. For example, "two mothers" is [أُمَّانِ]{.ar} [EummAni]{.trn} and [أُمَّيْنِ]{.ar} [Eummayni]{.trn}.

If a noun ends with an [Ealif]{.trn} followed by a [hamzah]{.trn} ([اء]{.ar}) then the [hamzah]{.trn} may get converted to a [wAw]{.trn} before adding the dual suffix. This is done based on the following rules:

1. If the [اء]{.ar} is a feminine marker then the [hamzah]{.trn} becomes a [wAw]{.trn}. For example,  
   [صَفْرَاء]{.ar} [SafrAE]{.trn} becomes [صَفْرَاوَانِ]{.ar} [SafrAwAni]{.trn} and [صَفْرَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [SafrAwayni]{.trn}.  
   [صَحْرَاء]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} becomes [صَحْرَاوَانِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAni]{.trn} and [صَحْرَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwayni]{.trn}.  
2. If [اء]{.ar} is not a feminine marker, then the [hamzah]{.trn} usually remains a [hamzah]{.trn} when adding the dual suffix. Examples:  
   [دُعَاء]{.ar} [dueAE]{.trn} becomes [دُعَاءَانِ]{.ar} [dueAEAni]{.trn} and [دُعَاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [dueAEayni]{.trn}.  
   [بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn} becomes [بِنَاءَانِ]{.ar} [binAEAni]{.trn} and [بِنَاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [binAEayni]{.trn}.  
   Sometimes, however, the [hamzah]{.trn} may become either a [wAw]{.trn} or a [yAE]{.trn} depending on the root of the word. We will learn these cases later, if Allah wills.

If a noun ends with the feminine marker [ىٰ]{.trn}, then:

1. If the [ىٰ]{.ar} is a feminine marker it becomes a [yAE]{.trn} with an [a]{.trn}-mark [يَ]{.ar} when adding the dual suffix . For example,  
   [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} becomes [غَضْبَيَانِ]{.ar} [gaDbayAni]{.trn} and [غَضْبَيَيْنِ]{.ar} [gaDbayayni]{.trn}.
2. If [ىٰ]{.ar} is not a feminine marker, then the [hamzah]{.trn} shall become either a [wAw]{.trn} or a [yAE]{.trn} depending on the root of the word. We will learn these cases later, if Allah wills.

## Sentences with duals

In subject-information sentences, if the subject is a dual, then the information will typically match it in being a dual. For example:

[ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  
[EalmarEatAni EummAni]{.trn}  
"The two women are mothers."

Note that both [ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ]{.ar} [EalmarEatAni]{.trn} "the two women" and [أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  [EummAni]{.trn}  "two mothers" are in the u-state because, just like for sentences with singulars, the subject and information are put in the u-state.

Sometimes, however, the subject and information may not match in number because of the meaning of the sentence. For example,

[ٱَلْبِنَاءَانِ مَدْرَسَةً]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEAni madrasatan]{.trn}  
"The two buildings are a school"

## Duals of descriptive nouns

Just like common nouns, descriptive nouns can also be duals. When a descriptive noun is used to describe a dual noun, the descriptive noun will also be dual. Examples:

The two women are noble.

The two men are very angry.

The big books are heavy.

The man read two heavy books.
