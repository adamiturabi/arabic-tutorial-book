# Duals

## Introduction

English has only a singular and a plural nouns. For any number greater than one, English uses the plural. For example,

"One house, two houses, three houses, etc."

On the other hand, Arabic uses the plural only for nouns in number three and higher. For nouns that are two in number Arabic uses the _dual_.

## Forming the dual

The dual is formed by appending [ـَانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} when the noun is in the u-state and [ـَانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. Example:

| States |  a house | two houses
:-------|:-------|:-------
u-state | [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} | [بَيْتَانِ]{.ar} [baytAni]{.trn}
a-state | [بَيْتًا]{.ar} [baytan]{.trn}| [بَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [baytayni]{.trn}
i-state | [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} | [بَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [baytayni]{.trn}

Note that there are no [n]{.trn} marks for the dual, despite it being indefinite. Definite dual nouns are also formed in the same way:

| States |  the house | the two houses
:-------|:-------|:-------
u-state | [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [Ealbaytu]{.trn}    | [ٱَلْبَيْتَانِ]{.ar} [EalbaytAni]{.trn}
a-state | [ٱَلْبَيْتَ]{.ar} [Ealbayta]{.trn}    | [ٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Ealbaytayni]{.trn}   
i-state | [ٱَلْبَيْتِ]{.ar} [Ealbayti]{.trn}    | [ٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Ealbaytayni]{.trn}

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is converted to a regular [tAE]{.trn} [ت]{.ar} before appending the dual suffix:

| States |  a tree | two trees
:-------|:-------|:-------
u-state | [شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn}| [شَجَرَتَانِ]{.ar} [cajaratAni]{.trn}
a-state | [شَجَرَةً]{.ar} [cajaratan]{.trn}| [شَجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar} [cajaratayni]{.trn}
i-state | [شَجَرَةٍ]{.ar} [cajaratin]{.trn}| [شَجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar} [cajaratayni]{.trn}

Note that if a feminine noun does not have a looped [tAE]{.trn} then it will simply be appended with [ـَانِ]{.ar} or [ـَيْنِ]{.ar}. For example, "two mothers" is [أُمَّانِ]{.ar} [EummAni]{.trn} and [أُمَّيْنِ]{.ar} [Eummayni]{.trn}.

### The dual for words ending with [اء]{.ar}

If a noun ends with an [Ealif]{.trn} followed by a [hamzah]{.trn} ([اء]{.ar}) then the [hamzah]{.trn} may get converted to a [wAw]{.trn} before adding the dual suffix. This is done based on the following rules:

1. If the [اء]{.ar} is a feminine marker then the [hamzah]{.trn} becomes a [wAw]{.trn}. For example,  
   + REMOVE (a because duals of non-descriptive nouns not yet discussed): [صَفْرَاء]{.ar} [SafrAE]{.trn} becomes [صَفْرَاوَانِ]{.ar} [SafrAwAni]{.trn} and [صَفْرَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [SafrAwayni]{.trn}.  
   + [صَحْرَاء]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} becomes [صَحْرَاوَانِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAni]{.trn} and [صَحْرَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwayni]{.trn}.  
2. If [اء]{.ar} is not a feminine marker, then the [hamzah]{.trn} can either remain a [hamzah]{.trn}, or turn into a [و]{.ar} when adding the dual suffix, depending on the root of the word. If [hamzah]{.trn} is part of the root of the word then it will remain a [hamzah]{.trn} when adding the dual suffix. For example, the root of [خَطَّاءٌ]{.ar} [xaTTAEun]{.trn} is [خطء]{.arroot}. With the dual suffix it becomes [خَطَّاءَانِ]{.ar} [xaTTAEAni]{.trn} and [خَطَّاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [xaTTAEayni]{.trn}. On the other hand, if the [hamzah]{.trn} was originally a [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar} in the root, then it may either remain a [hamzah]{.trn} or turn into a [و]{.ar} when adding the dual suffix.  Examples:  
   + [دُعَاء]{.ar} [dueAE]{.trn} (root: [دعو]{.arroot}) becomes either [دُعَاءَانِ]{.ar} [dueAEAni]{.trn} and [دُعَاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [dueAEayni]{.trn} or [دُعَاوَانِ]{.ar} [dueAwAni]{.trn} and [دُعَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [dueAwayni]{.trn}.  
   + [بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn} (root: [بني]{.arroot}) becomes either [بِنَاءَانِ]{.ar} [binAEAni]{.trn} and [بِنَاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [binAEayni]{.trn} or [بِنَاوَانِ]{.ar} [binAwAni]{.trn} and [بِنَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [binAwayni]{.trn}.  

   We recommend that you retain the [hamzah]{.trn} when forming the dual, and we will specify if [و]{.ar} is preferred for a particular word.

<!-- This wordreference forum thread mentions that the hamza can become a waw or a yaa depending on the original root: https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/%D9%80%D8%A7-%D9%80%D9%89-%D9%80%D8%A7%D8%A1-dual-suffix.337799/. However this is rejected by this forum thread: http://www.alfaseeh.com/vb/showthread.php?t=81133 which say that the hamza may onlu become a waw. Wright (vol. i, sect. 299, rem. c, p. 188) and al-nahw al-wafi (part 4, p. 622) also agree with alfaseeh.-->

### The dual for words ending with [ىٰ]{.ar}

If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar}, then whether the [ىٰ]{.ar} is a feminine marker or not, it becomes a [yAE]{.trn} with an [a]{.trn}-mark [يَ]{.ar} when adding the dual suffix . For example,  

+ [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} (root: [غضب]{.arroot}) becomes [غَضْبَيَانِ]{.ar} [gaDbayAni]{.trn} and [غَضْبَيَيْنِ]{.ar} [gaDbayayni]{.trn}.
+ [ٱَلْهُدَىٰ]{.ar} [EalhudA]{.trn} (root: [هدي]{.arroot}) becomes [ٱَلْهُدَيَانِ]{.ar} [EalhudayAni]{.trn} and [ٱَلْهُدَيَيْنِ]{.ar} [Ealhudayayni]{.trn}.

<!-- Don't discuss duals of defective nouns in detail here. Discuss them in the chapter of defective nouns.-->

## Sentences with duals

In subject-information sentences, if the subject is a dual, then the information will typically match it in being a dual. For example:

[ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  
[EalmarEatAni EummAni]{.trn}  
"The two women are mothers."

Note that both [ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ]{.ar} [EalmarEatAni]{.trn} "the two women" and [أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  [EummAni]{.trn}  "two mothers" are in the u-state because, just like for sentences with singulars, the subject and information are put in the u-state.

Sometimes, however, the subject and information may not match in number because of the meaning of the sentence. For example,

[ٱَلْبِنَاءَانِ مَدْرَسَةً]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEAni madrasatan]{.trn}  
"The two buildings are a school"

## Duals of descriptive nouns

Just like common nouns, descriptive nouns can also be duals. When a descriptive noun is used to describe a dual noun, the descriptive noun will also be dual. Examples:

The two women are noble.

The two men are very angry.

The big books are heavy.

The man read two heavy books.

## Pronouns of the dual

We have learned detached pronouns, past-tense verb doer pronouns, and attached pronouns for the singular. Here we will add the corresponding pronouns for the dual:

|Person|Detached pronoun|Past-tense verb doer pronoun|Attached pronoun|
|:---|:----|:--|:----|
| he/him |[هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} |[◌َ]{.ar}  [-a]{.trn}  |[ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}|
| she/her |[هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} |[ـَتْ]{.ar} [-at]{.trn} |[ـهَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ masc.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[ـَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ fem.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[ـَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ masc.~ |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} |[ـتَ]{.ar} [-ta]{.trn} |[ـكَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ fem.~ |[أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} |[ـتِ]{.ar}  [-ti]{.trn} |[ـكِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn}|
| you~dual~ |[أَنْتُمَا]{.ar} [EantumA]{.trn} |[ـتُمَا]{.ar} [-tumA]{.trn} |[ـكُمَا]{.ar} [-kumA]{.trn}|
| I/me |[أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} |[ـتُ]{.ar}  [-tu]{.trn} |[ـنِي]{.ar} [-nI]{.trn}/[ـِي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn}|
| we/us~dual~ |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} |[ـنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} |[ـنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}|

The following rules are to be followed when using the above pronouns:

+ The dual attached and detached pronouns for the non-participator "they/them~dual\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn}.
+ Only the dual past-tense verb doer pronoun for the non-participator differentiates between the masculine ([ـَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn}) and feminine ([ـَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn}). Otherwise, the same pronouns are used in the dual for both genders.
+ Speaker pronouns do not differentiate between the masculine and feminine genders.
+ The attached and past-tense verb doer pronouns for the dual speaker "we/us" are the same: [نَا]{.ar} [nA]{.trn}.
+ The [u]{.trn}-mark on the attached pronouns [ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn} and [ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark ([ـهِ]{.ar} [-hi]{.trn} and [ـهِمَا]{.ar} [-himA]{.trn} respectively) when they are preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}. Examples: 
  + [عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}, [ealayhi]{.trn} "on him"
  + [فِيهِمَا]{.ar} [fIhimA]{.trn} "in them~dual~"

Examples with dual pronouns:

+ [هُمَا جَارِيَتَانِ]{.ar}  
  [humA jAriyatAni]{.trn}  
  "They~dual~ are two girls."

## Verbs with dual doer nouns

We have just learned that if the doer of a verb is a dual pronoun, we add the dual doer pronoun suffix. For the non-participator person this suffix is [ـَا]{.ar} [A]{.trn}. For example,

[ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"They~dual~ went to a house."

Here we we like to add that if a dual doer noun is mentioned then, just like for singular doers, we keep the non-participator doer pronoun suffix with the verb with the following instructions:

1. If the doer noun is placed before the verb, then the dual doer pronoun suffix is employed.
2. If the doer noun is placed after the verb, then the singular doer pronoun suffix corresponding to the gender of the singular doer noun is employed.

For example,

+ [ٱَلرَّجُلَانِ ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [EarrujalAni pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) men went to a house."

  In this example, the doer [ٱَلرَّجُلَانِ]{.ar} [EarrujulAni]{.trn} "the (two) men" comes before the verb. Therefore the verb has the dual masculine doer pronoun suffix.

+ [ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَتَانِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [pahabati -lmarEatAni EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) women went to a house."

  In this example, the doer [ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ]{.ar} [ElmarEatAni]{.trn} "the (two) women" comes after the verb. Therefore the verb has the singular feminine doer pronoun suffix.
