# Duals

## Introduction

For any number greater than one, English uses the plural. For example, the plural of "house" is "houses". So in English we will say:

"two houses"

Arabic, on the other hand, uses the plural only for nouns in number three and higher. For nouns that are two in number Arabic uses the _dual_.

## Forming the dual

The dual is formed by appending dual suffix [◌َانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} when the noun is in the u-state and [◌َيْنِ]{.ar} [ayni]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. Definite nouns, which have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in their beginning are dualized the same way. 

For example, when we dualize [بَيْت]{.ar} [bayt]{.trn} "house" in order to say "two houses", we get:

| States | Indefinite | Definite
:----|:-------|:-------
u-state         | [بَيْتَانِ]{.ar} [baytAni]{.trn}  | [ٱَلْبَيْتَانِ]{.ar} [EalbaytAni]{.trn}
a- and i-states | [بَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [baytayni]{.trn} | [ٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Ealbaytayni]{.trn}   

Note that indefinite duals don't have [n]{.trn} marks. The only difference between definite and indefinite duals is the prefix [ٱَلْ]{.ar}.

## Duals of nouns that end with feminine markers

### Nouns ending in [ة]{.ar}

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is converted to an open [tAE]{.trn} [ت]{.ar} before appending the dual suffix. For example, dualizing [شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} "tree", we get "two trees":

| States | Indefinite | Definite
:----|:-------|:-------
u-state         | [شَجَرَتَانِ]{.ar} [cajaratAni]{.trn} | [ٱَلشَّجَرَتَانِ]{.ar} [EaccajaratAni]{.trn}
a- and i-states | [شَجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar} [cajaratayni]{.trn}| [ٱَلشَّجَرَتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Eaccajaratayni]{.trn}

If a feminine noun does not have a looped [tAE]{.trn} then it will simply be appended with [◌َانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} and [◌َيْنِ]{.ar} [ayni]{.trn}. For example, dualizing [أُمّ]{.ar} [Eumm]{.trn} "mother" in order to get "two mothers", we get [أُمَّانِ]{.ar} [EummAni]{.trn} in the u-state and [أُمَّيْنِ]{.ar} [Eummayni]{.trn} in the a- and i-states.

### Nouns ending with [اء]{.ar}

If a noun ends with the feminine marker [اء]{.ar} which is external to the word's root then the [ء]{.ar} shall be changed into a [و]{.ar} when appending the dual suffixes [◌َانِ]{.ar} [Ani]{.trn} [◌َيْنِ]{.ar} [ayni]{.trn}. Example:

[صَحْرَاء]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} (root: [صحر]{.arroot}) becomes [صَحْرَاوَانِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAni]{.trn} and [صَحْرَاوَيْنِ]{.ar} [SaHrAwayni]{.trn}.

Remember that there are some words where [اء]{.ar} may be part of the word's root, e.g. [ٱِبْتِدَاء]{.ar} [ibtidAE]{.trn} "a beginning" whose root is [بدء]{.arroot}. Because here the [ء]{.ar} in [ٱبْتِدَاء]{.ar} is part of the word's root, therefore the [ء]{.ar} shall not be changed into a [و]{.ar} when appending the dual suffixes. It remains a [ء]{.ar} thus: [ٱِبْتِدَاءانِ]{.ar} [EibtidAEAni]{.trn} and [ٱِبْتِدَاءَيْنِ]{.ar} [EibtidAEayni]{.trn}.

There are other words where [اء]{.ar} is not external to the word's root, but where the [ء]{.ar} has been changed from an original [و]{.ar} or a [ي]{.ar} in the word's root. We will learn how to form duals of these words later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

### The dual for words ending with [ىٰ]{.ar}

If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar} which is external to the word's root then the [ىٰ]{.ar} shall be changed to a [يَ]{.ar} when adding the dual suffixes. For example,  

[غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} (root: [غضب]{.arroot}) becomes [غَضْبَيَانِ]{.ar} [gaDbayAni]{.trn} and [غَضْبَيَيْنِ]{.ar} [gaDbayayni]{.trn}.

Beware also that, just like in the case of [اء]{.ar}, there are some words where [ىٰ]{.ar} is not external to the word's root, like [ٱَلْهُدَىٰ]{.ar} [EalhudA]{.trn} "the guidance" whose root is [هدي]{.arroot}. We will learn how to form duals of these words later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

<!-- Don't discuss duals of defective nouns in detail here. Discuss them in the chapter of defective nouns.-->

## Subject-information sentences with a dual subject

In subject-information sentences, if the subject is a dual, then the information will typically match it in being a dual. For example:

[ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  
[EalmarEatAni EummAni]{.trn}  
"The two women are mothers."

Note that both [ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ]{.ar} [EalmarEatAni]{.trn} "the two women" and [أُمَّانِ]{.ar}  [EummAni]{.trn}  "two mothers" are in the u-state because, just like for sentences with singulars, the subject and information are put in the u-state.

Sometimes, however, the subject and information may not match in number because of the meaning of the sentence. For example,

[ٱَلْبِنَاءَانِ مَدْرَسَةً]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEAni madrasatan]{.trn}  
"The two buildings are a school"

### Duals of qualitative nouns

Just like common nouns, qualitative nouns can also be duals. When a qualitative noun is used to describe a dual noun, the qualitative noun will also be dual. Examples:

The two women are noble.

The two men are very angry.

The big books are heavy.

The man read two heavy books.

## Detached pronouns for the dual

We have learned the detached pronouns that are used in place of singular nouns. They are:

|Person|Detached pronoun
|:---|:-
Absent person (masc.) "he"             |[هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} 
Absent person (fem.)  "she"            |[هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} 
Addressed person (masc.) "you~masc.~"  |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} 
Addressed person (fem.) "you~fem.~"    |[أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} 
Speaking person (masc. and fem.) "I"   |[أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn}

Here are the detached pronouns for the dual persons:

|Person|Detached pronoun
|:---|:-
Absent person (masc. and fem.) "they~dual~"   |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} 
Addressed person (masc. and fem.) "you~dual~" |[أَنْتُمَا]{.ar} [EantumA]{.trn} 
Speaking person (masc. and fem.) "we"         |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn}

Note that the dual detached pronouns are the same for both genders.

Here are some examples of their use:

[هُمَا مُعَلِّمَتَانِ كَرِيمَتَانِ.]{.ar}  
[humA mueallimatAni karImatAni.]{.trn}  
"They~dual.\ fem.~ are noble teachers."

## Verbal sentences with dual nouns

We learned that the completed-action verb for a masculine doer is on the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar}. And when the doer is feminine, the [ت]{.ar} of femininity is attached to the verb thus: [فَعَلَتْ]{.ar}. We have used these verbs with singular doer nouns. The doer noun always comes after the verb and shall be in the u-state. Examples:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy went." 

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatun]{.trn}  
"A girl went." 

These same verbs are used when the doer noun is a dual. Examples:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامَانِ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmAni.]{.trn}  
"The two boys went." 

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatAni.]{.trn}  
"Two girls went." 

Dual doees shall be in the a-state, just like singular doees. Example:

## Pronouns of the dual

We have learned detached pronouns, completed-action verb doer-modifications, and attached pronouns for the singular. Here we will add the corresponding pronouns for the dual. We use the root [فعلل]{.arroot} as a template to show the verb doer-modifications.

|Person|Detached pronoun|Completed-action verb doer-modification|Attached pronoun|
|:---|:----|:--|:----|
| he/him |[هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} |[فَعَلَ]{.ar}  [-a]{.trn}  |[ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}|
| she/her |[هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} |[فَعَلَتْ]{.ar} [-at]{.trn} |[ـهَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ masc.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[فَعَلَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ fem.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[فَعَلَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ masc.~ |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتَ]{.ar} [-ta]{.trn} |[ـكَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ fem.~ |[أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتِ]{.ar}  [-ti]{.trn} |[ـكِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn}|
| you~dual~ |[أَنْتُمَا]{.ar} [EantumA]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُمَا]{.ar} [-tumA]{.trn} |[ـكُمَا]{.ar} [-kumA]{.trn}|
| I/me |[أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُ]{.ar}  [-tu]{.trn} |[ـنِي]{.ar} [-nI]{.trn}/[ـِي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn}|
| we/us~dual~ |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} |[فَعَلْنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} |[ـنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}|

The following rules are to be followed when using the above pronouns:

+ The dual attached and detached pronouns for the absent person "they/them~dual\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn}.
+ Only the dual verb doer-modification for the absent person differentiates between the masculine ([ـَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn}) and feminine ([ـَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn}). Otherwise, the same pronouns and verb doer-modifications are used in the dual for both genders.
+ Speaking person pronouns and verb doer-modifications do not differentiate between the masculine and feminine genders.
+ The attached pronoun and verb doer-modification for the dual speaking person "we/us" are the same: [نَا]{.ar} [nA]{.trn}.
+ The [u]{.trn}-mark on the attached pronouns [ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn} and [ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark ([ـهِ]{.ar} [-hi]{.trn} and [ـهِمَا]{.ar} [-himA]{.trn} respectively) when they are preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}. Examples: 
  + [عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}, [ealayhi]{.trn} "on him"
  + [فِيهِمَا]{.ar} [fIhimA]{.trn} "in them~dual~"

Examples with dual pronouns:

+ [هُمَا جَارِيَتَانِ]{.ar}  
  [humA jAriyatAni]{.trn}  
  "They~dual~ are two girls."

## Verbs with dual doer nouns {#chap-duals-sec-verbs-dual-doer}

Just like verbs are modified for singular doers, they are also modified for dual doers, using the doer-modifications shown in the previous section. For example:

[ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"They~dual~ went to a house."

However the usage of dual doer-modifications are a little more complicated than the singular doer-modifications. Here are the rules for using doer-modifications for dual doers:

1. If the doer noun is not mentioned, then the dual doer-modification is used.
2. But if the doer noun is mentioned then:
   a. If the doer noun is placed before the verb, then the dual doer-modification is employed.
   b. If the doer noun is placed after the verb, then the singular doer-modification corresponding to the gender of the doers is employed.

Examples:

+ [ٱَلرَّجُلَانِ ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [EarrujalAni pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) men went to a house."

  In this example, the doer [ٱَلرَّجُلَانِ]{.ar} [EarrujulAni]{.trn} "the (two) men" comes before the verb. Therefore the verb has the dual masculine doer-modification.

+ [ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَتَانِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [pahabati -lmarEatAni EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) women went to a house."

  In this example, the doer [ٱَلْمَرْأَتَانِ]{.ar} [ElmarEatAni]{.trn} "the (two) women" comes after the verb. Therefore the verb has the singular feminine doer-modification.

+ [فَتَحَ ٱلرَّجُلَانِ ٱلْبَابَ وَدَخَلَا.]{.ar}  
  [fataHa -rrujalAni -lbAba wadaxalA.]{.trn}  
  "The two men opened the door and entered."

  In this sentence, the doer is after the first verb so the first verb has the singular doer-modification. However, the second verb is after the doer so it has the dual doer-modification.
