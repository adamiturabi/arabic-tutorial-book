# Sentence and government theory

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will study the Arabic grammatical model for constructing sentences.
We will first define some linguistic terms.

### Truth-evaluability

Statements are classified into two types:

 i. a [xabari]{.subs} statement
ii. a [inshai]{.subs} statement

A _[xabari]{.subs}_ statement is one that can be judged to be true or false.
In other words it is falsifiable.
For example, if we have a statement:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The above statement may be judged to have a truth value.
If zayd is actually standing, then the statement is true.
And if zayd is not standing, then the statement is false.

A _[inshai]{.subs}_ statement,
on the other hand,
does not have a truth value.
Here are some examples of [inshai]{.subs} statements:

(@) [اضْرِبْ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    [Beat Zayd!]{.trans}

(@) [لَا تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}  
    [Don't do [it]!]{.trans}

(@) [يَا زَيْدُ]{.ar}  
    [O Zayd]{.trans}

(@) [مَنْ هُوَ]{.ar}  
    [Who is he?]{.trans}


### Syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics

#### Syntax and semantics {.unnumbered}

_Semantics_ is the study of the meanings of words.
And _syntax_ is the study of how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships between the words in a sentence.
For example, consider the [sifah]{.subs} [كَبِير]{.ar}.
Semantically, it gives the meaning of something being big.
When it is in a linguistic environment, like a phrase or a sentence,
then its syntactical role is determined by the grammatical relationships it has with other words in the sentence.

Consider the following sentence:

(@) [الْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
    [The house is big]{.trans}

In the above sentence, 
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is _syntactically_ a [xabar]{.subs}.

Now consider the following sentence:

(@) [دَخَلَ بَيْتًا كَبِيرًا]{.ar}  
    [He entered a big house.]{.trans}

Now the same noun
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is syntactically a [na3t]{.subs}.
In both examples,
[كَبِير]{.ar} has the same semantic signification.

<!--
#### Semantics {.unnumbered}

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words.
Consider the following sentence:

(@) taHaddatha fi al-bayt.

Here the semantic meaning of fi determines the meaning of the sentence.
If fi means "in" then the sentence means "He talked in the house."
And if fi means "regarding", then the sentence means "He talked about the house."

Semantics can affect the syntax of a sentence.

(@) al-af3Alu Hasanatun  
    "The acts are good."

(@) al-af3Alu HasanAtun  
    "The acts are good deeds."
-->

#### Pragmatics {.unnumbered}

<!--
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in context, and with regard to needs of the speaker and the listener.
-->
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in a specific context or situation.


<!--
#### Functional aspects {.unnumbered}

Semantics and pragmatics
-->

#### Stylistics {.unnumbered}

In order to express a meaning, there will often be a normal way to choose words or construct a sentence's structure.
If, for some effect (rhetorical, persuasive, literary, etc.), the speaker chooses to deviate from this norm,
then he is doing so for stylistic reasons.^[Hickey, L, "Stylistics, Pragmatics, and Pragmastylistics"]


## The theory of government

A sentence in Arabic is constituted from elements.
An element can be a noun, a verb, or a particle.
Of these elements, some have the quality of state.
These are called _stateful_ elements.
The stateful elements are nouns and [mudarie]{.subs} verbs.
A noun may be either in the [ustate]{.subs}, [astate]{.subs}, or [istate]{.subs}.
And a [mudarie]{.subs} verb may be either in the [ustate]{.subs}, [astate]{.subs}, or [0state]{.subs}.
The theory of government states that a stateful element is put in a particular state by a _governor_.
For example:

(@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    [in the house]{.trans}

In the above example,
<!--
the particle fii is the governor of the noun al-daari.
The noun al-daar is the governee of its governor fii.
-->
the gpreposition [فِي]{.ar} causes the noun [الدَّار]{.ar} to be in the [istate]{.subs}.
So we say that 
the governor [فِي]{.ar} _governs_ [الدَّار]{.ar} (the _governee_) in the [istate]{.subs}.
<!--
We say that
the preposition fii is the governor of [istate]{.subs} noun al-daar because it is the reason or cause of the noun al-daar being in the [istate]{.subs}.

Here is another example:

(@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr) Daraba zaydun eamran.

In this example, the governor is the verb Daraba.
It has two governees:
the [faa3il]{.subs} zayd,
and the [mafulb]{.subs} eamr.
The governor Daraba governs the [faa3il]{.subs} zayd in the [ustate]{.subs}
and it governs the [mafulb]{.subs} in the [astate]{.subs}.

#### A governee can only have one governor  {.unnumbered}

From example (@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr),
you can see that one goveror may govern multiple governees.
However, one governee cannot be be governed by multiple governors.
In other words, there can be only one governor that causes a stateful element to be in a particular state.

#### The word-order of a governor and its governee(s)  {.unnumbered}

From the above examples,
you can see that a governor typically occurs before its governees in word-order.
For some governor-governee relationships, this word-order is obligatory,
like in example (@3amal_in_house).
For other governor-governee relationships, this word-order is more flexible.
For example, the [maful]{.subs} may occur before its governing verb, thus:

(@3amal_3amran_Daraba_zaydun) eamran Daraba zaydun

<!--
But the [faa3il]{.subs} must always follow its governing verb.
So that is another example of an obligatory word-order for the governor and the governee.
-->

## Some common governees

Let's look at some common governor-governee relationships.
We will make use of the following example:

(@) [قَرَأَ الْغُلَامُ الطَّوِيلُ كِتَابَ الجَارِيَةِ فِي الدَّارِ الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}

#### The [istate]{.subs} noun {.unnumbered}

A noun in the [istate]{.subs} is governed by a preceding preposition or [mudaf]{.subs}.
We have already seen that the
[istate]{.subs} noun [الدَّار]{.ar} is governed by the preceding preposition [فِي]{.ar}.
<!--
We saw an example of a governing preposition in (@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar} above.
-->
We also see that the [istate]{.subs} [mudafil]{.subs} [الجَارِيَةِ]{.ar}
is governed by the [mudaf]{.subs} [كِتَابَ]{.ar}.

#### The [faa3il]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [faa3il]{.subs} of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its [faa3il]{.subs} [الْغُلَامُ]{.ar} in the [ustate]{.subs}.

#### The [mafulb]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [mafulb]{.subs} is also governed by its verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its [mafulb]{.subs} [كِتَابَ]{.ar} in the [astate]{.subs}.

#### The [na3t]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

A [na3t]{.subs} is governed by governor of its [manut]{.subs}.
In our example, the [na3t]{.subs} [الطَّوِيلُ]{.ar} is governed in the [ustate]{.subs} by [قَرَأَ]{.ar}, which is the governor of its [manut]{.subs}
[الْغُلَامُ]{.ar}.
Similarly, the [na3t]{.subs}
[الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}
is governed in the [istate]{.subs} by the preposition [فِي]{.ar} because [فِي]{.ar} also governs its [manut]{.subs} [الدَّارِ]{.ar}.

<!--
Here is an example of an [istate]{.subs} noun 
([زَيْدٍ]{.ar})
being governed by a preceding [mudaf]{.subs}
([كِتَابُ]{.ar}):

(@) [كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd's book]{.trans}

#### The [faa3il]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [faa3il]{.subs} of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its [faa3il]{.subs}
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the [ustate]{.subs}.

#### The [mafulb]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [faa3il]{.subs} of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its [faa3il]{.subs}
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the [ustate]{.subs}.
-->

#### Ungoverned elements {.unnumbered}

Not every element in a sentence is governed by a governor.
For example, the [madi]{.subs} verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} has no state, and thus, no governor.

Here is a diagram depicting the above governor-governee relationships:

DIAGRAM

## The two [3umdah]{.subs} elements of a sentence

In the Arabic grammatical model,
a sentence is analagous to the structure of a simple _lean-to_ building.
<!--
A building is built upon a foundation.
The foundation of the Arabic sentence
-->
This structure
requires two _[3umdah]{.subs}_ elements
in order to be [isnaad_comp]{.subs}.^[Wright 2/250ff; [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 13ff]
These two [3umdah]{.subs} elements are:

 i. The [muxbar3]{.subs}
ii. The [muxbar]{.subs}

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]

\draw[pattern=north west lines, pattern, draw=none] (0,0) rectangle (6,-0.4);
\draw (0,0) -- (6,0);
\draw[fill=lightgray] (2,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=90] {structure-starter} (2.4, 5);
\draw[fill=lightgray, rotate around={30:(5.05,-0.3)}] (5.05,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=-60] {structure-completer} (5.45, 6);

\end{tikzpicture}
```


The [muxbar3]{.subs} is the primary [3umdah]{.subs} element.
It represents whom the sentence is about, i.e. its topic.
The [muxbar]{.subs} rests against the [muxbar3]{.subs}.
<!--
And the [muxbar]{.subs} is meant to provide some interesting comment about the [muxbar3]{.subs}.
-->
It expresses some property about the [muxbar3]{.subs} that completes the meaning of the sentence.

Once the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements are in place,
the sentence is [isnaad_comp]{.subs}.
Other _[fadlah]{.subs}_ elements
(see section\ (ref) below)
may be added in addition to the [3umdah]{.subs} elements to add meaning to the sentence,
but they are not required to make the sentence [isnaad_comp]{.subs}.

Let's look at the [3umdah]{.subs} elements for the two types of Arabic sentences:

<!--
Here are some examples of sentences with only [3umdah]{.subs} elements:
-->

### The [3umdah]{.subs} elements of a [j_ism]{.subs}

In a [j_ism]{.subs} the [mubtada]{.subs} is the [muxbar3]{.subs} and the [xabar]{.subs} is the [muxbar]{.subs}.
Consider the following [j_ism]{.subs}:

(@3amal_zayd_qaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_zayd_qaimun) above is a [j_ism]{.subs}.
The [mubtada]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the [muxbar3]{.subs}. It is the topic of the sentence.
The [xabar]{.subs}
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is the [muxbar]{.subs}.
It is a comment on the topic, giving us some information about
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a [j_ism]{.subs}.
In this [j_ism]{.subs} the [mubtada]{.subs} is the [muxbar3]{.subs},
and the [xabar]{.subs} is the [muxbar]{.subs}.
-->

### The [3umdah]{.subs} elements of a [j_f3l]{.subs}

In a [j_f3l]{.subs} the verb is the [muxbar]{.subs} and its [faa3il]{.subs} is the [muxbar3]{.subs}.
Consider the following [j_f3l]{.subs}:

(@3amal_qaama_zaydun) [قَامَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above is a [j_f3l]{.subs}.
The [faa3il]{.subs}
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the [muxbar3]{.subs}. It is the topic of the sentence.
And the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} is the [muxbar]{.subs}. It is a comment on the topic.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a [j_f3l]{.subs}.
In this [j_f3l]{.subs} the verb is the [muxbar]{.subs},
and the [faa3il]{.subs} is the [muxbar3]{.subs}.
-->
<!--
We will see later, [ia]{.subs} that 
in a [j_f3l]{.subs}
the [muxbar]{.subs} may sometimes be another element, instead of the verb that governs the [faa3il]{.subs}.
-->

## [#pregov]{.subs}

<!--
Besides the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements,
a sentence also needs an [pregov]{.subs}.[Owens §2.3.6.1 54]
-->
In order to build a sentence from the [3umdah]{.subs} elements,
a sentence needs _[pregov]{.subs}_.[Owens §2.3.6.1, 54]
<!--
The [pregov]{.subs} governs the highest governing element(s) of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements of the sentence.
-->
<!--
The [pregov]{.subs} is the source of all government in the sentence.
-->
[#pregov]{.subs} is any and all government prior to, and until, the first governed [3umdah]{.subs} element.

#### One of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements is the [pregov]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

In some sentences, the intitial governor may be one of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements.
In example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above,
the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} governs its [faa3il]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
The [madi]{.subs} verb [قَامَ]{.ar} has no state and thus needs no governor.
So it is, itself, the [pregov]{.subs}.

DIAGRAM

#### Another (non-[3umdah]{.subs}) element is the [pregov]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The intitial governor may be internal to the sentence but not one of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements.
<!--
In such cases,
even though the [pregov]{.subs} is not one of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements,
we don't call it an [fadlah]{.subs} element.
-->

Here are some examples:

(@) [لَمْ يَضْرِبِ الرَّجُلُ غُلَامَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [Owens,\ J., _The foundations of grammar_ §2.2.3, 41]{.citex}  
    [The man did not beat Zayd's slave.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM
    
<!--
(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above,
the verb [كَانَ]{.ar} is the [pregov]{.subs}.
But because it is a [naqis]{.subs} verb, it does not complete the sentence grammatically.
Therefore, it is not an [3umdah]{.subs} element.
But it is needed to govern the [3umdah]{.subs} elements.
-->

#### The abstract [pregov]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

Very commonly, the [pregov]{.subs} is not an actual word, but only an abstract concept.
When there is one or more stateful [3umdah]{.subs} elements in a sentence with no overt (i.e. observable) governor,
then this necessitates bringing in a _abstract_ [pregov]{.subs}.^[Owens,\ J., _The foundations of grammar_ 55; Peled, _Sentence types_ 87--88]
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 87]{.citex}  
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}

The abstract [pregov]{.subs} governs both the [muxbar3]{.subs} (the [mubtada]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}),
and the [muxbar]{.subs} (the [xabar]{.subs} 
[مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar})
in the [ustate]{.subs}.

(@) [يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd stands]{.trans}

The abstract [pregov]{.subs} governs the [muxbar]{.subs} (the [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar}) in the [ustate]{.subs}.
And, as usual, the verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar} governs its [faa3il]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} (the [muxbar3]{.subs}) in the [ustate]{.subs}.

<!--

#### An external element as the [pregov]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, it is possible for an element that is external to the sentence under question, to be its [pregov]{.subs}.
We will learn moe about this case in sections\ (ref) and (ref) below.
-->

<!--
(@) zaydun DAribun abUhu eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, [ia]{.subs}.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example, the smaller sentence is
DAribun abUhu eamran
"His father is beating eamr."
The [ism_fail]{.subs} DAribun governs the its [faa3il]{.subs} abUhu,
and its [mafulb]{.subs} 3amr.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an [ism_fail]{.subs} may have a [faa3il]{.subs} and a [mafulb]{.subs}.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the [ustate]{.subs} because it is the [xabar]{.subs} of the [mubtada]{.subs} zaydun.
by the conceptual governor that governs the larger sentence.

(@) inna zaydan DAribun eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, [ia]{.subs}.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the [pregov]{.subs} is the particle inna.
It governs its [ism_of]{.subs} zaydun in the [astate]{.subs}.
And it governs its [xabar]{.subs} DAribun in the [ustate]{.subs}.
However, its [xabar]{.subs} 
the smaller sentence is
DAribun eamran
"He is beating eamr."
The [ism_fail]{.subs} DAribun governs
and its [mafulb]{.subs} 3amr,
(and also its implied [faa3il]{.subs} "he").
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an [ism_fail]{.subs} may have a [faa3il]{.subs} and a [mafulb]{.subs}.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the [ustate]{.subs} because it is the [xabar]{.subs} of the [pregov]{.subs} inna.
-->

<!--
(@) kāna Zaydun munṭaliqan ʾabūhu
    [peled 207 citing zajjaji]{.citex}

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, [ia]{.subs}.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the [pregov]{.subs} of the outer sentence is the verb kaana.
It governs its [faa3il]{.subs} zaydun in the [ustate]{.subs}.
And it governs its [xabar]{.subs} muntaliqan in the [astate]{.subs}.
However,
muntaliqan and its [faa3il]{.subs} abUhu
also constitute a sentence by themselves.
This is the inner sentence within the outer sentence.
This inner sentence 
muntaliqan abuhu
has two [3umdah]{.subs} elements: 
the [ism_fail]{.subs} muntaliq,
and its [faa3il]{.subs} abUhu.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an [ism_fail]{.subs} can have a [faa3il]{.subs})
muntaliq governs abUhu.
But muntaliq itself is also governed by an [pregov]{.subs} (the verb kaana) that is not in this inner sentence.
-->
<!--
#### More than one element in the [pregov]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, there may be more than one element (in a chain) in the [pregov]{.subs}, before one reaches the first governed [3umdah]{.subs} element.
For example:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the [0state]{.subs}.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a [naqis]{.subs} verb, is not an [3umdah]{.subs} element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the [muxbar3]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the [ustate]{.subs}
and the [muxbar]{.subs} [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the [astate]{.subs}.
Therefore [يَكُنْ]{.ar} is part of the [pregov]{.subs}.
-->

## [#fadlah]{.subs} elements

A [fadlah]{.subs} element is any stateful element in a sentence,
after the [pregov]{.subs},
that is not either of the two [3umdah]{.subs} elements.
The source of government for 
a [fadlah]{.subs} element must be,
directly or indirectly,
one of the [3umdah]{.subs} elements.

We know from section\ (ref) above,
that in a [j_ism]{.subs} the [3umdah]{.subs} elements are the [mubtada]{.subs} and the [xabar]{.subs}.
And that in
a [j_f3l]{.subs} the [3umdah]{.subs} elements are the verb and its [faa3il]{.subs}.
So all other elements besides these 
(and elements that constitute the [pregov]{.subs})
are [fadlah]{.subs} elements.
Here is an (incomplete) list of some common [fadlah]{.subs} elements:
<!--
We will discuss some of [fadlah]{.subs} elements below:

#### The [astate]{.subs} governees of a verb {.unnumbered}

The most prominent [fadlah]{.subs} elements are 
all [astate]{.subs} elements that a verb governs.
These include:
-->

* the [na3t]{.subs}
* the [mafulb]{.subs} (usually)
* the [mmutlaq]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [dharf_zaman]{.subs} and the [dharf_makan]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [mafull]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [mafulm]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [hal]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [tamyiz]{.subs} (see chapter\ (ref))


By the way,
when we say _[fadlah]{.subs}_,
we mean that an element is [fadlah]{.subs} in the sense that it is not required to complete the sentence _structurally_.
We don't mean that it is superfluous in terms of its meaning.
In fact, a [fadlah]{.subs} element may be essential for the correct meaning of the sentence.
For example, consider the [ayah]{.subs}:

(@) [وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا ٱلسَّمَاۤءَ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَمَا بَیۡنَهُمَا لَـٰعِبِینَ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأنبياء]{.ar} 21:16](https://quran.com/21/16) cited by [[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/14](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/13)]{.citex}  
    [And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.]{.trans}

[لَاعِبِينَ]{.ar} is a [hal]{.subs} (see in chapter\ (ref)),
which is a [fadlah]{.subs} element.
If we remove it from the sentence,
then the sentence will be [isnaad_comp]{.subs} but it will have an incorrect meaning.

<!--
The [mafulb]{.subs} is usually a [fadlah]{.subs} element.
In most sentences, if we remove the [mafulb]{.subs} the sentence remains [isnaad_comp]{.subs}.
For example:

However, if a verb is [naqis]{.subs}
(for example [كَانَ]{.ar}),
then its [mafulb]{.subs} is renamed to be the [xabar]{.subs}

We saw an example of this in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.
-->
<!--
#### The [mudafil]{.subs} in an [idaafah]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

Technically,
the [mudafil]{.subs} in an [idaafah]{.subs} is considered a [fadlah]{.subs} unit.
Consider the following example:

(@) abU zaydin axU eamrin

If we remove the [mudafil]{.subs} nouns from the sentence we get:

(@) al-abu al-axu

This is a complete sentence.
al-abu is the [mubtada]{.subs}.
And al-axu is the [xabar]{.subs} (the [muxbar]{.subs}).

However, for convenience, we will often (loosely) treat
the annexation as one unit.
So we may say that the [mubtada]{.subs} is
abu zaydin
and that the [muxbar]{.subs} is axu 3amr.

#### The [tabi3]{.subs}s {.unnumbered}

The [tabi3]{.subs}s are considered [fadlah]{.subs} elements.
These include:

## Refining the definitions of the [j_ism]{.subs} and the [j_f3l]{.subs}

We know that there are two basic types of Arabic sentences:

 i. The [j_ism]{.subs}
ii. The [j_f3l]{.subs}

Previously we had said that a [j_ism]{.subs} is one that begins with a noun.
And a [j_ism]{.subs} is one that begins with a verb.
We will now refine these definitions:

<!--
A _[j_ism]{.subs}_ is one whose first [3umdah]{.subs} element is a noun.
And
a _[j_f3l]{.subs}_ is one whose first [3umdah]{.subs} element is a verb.
-->
A _[j_ism]{.subs}_ is one whose [3umdah]{.subs} elements are two nouns: a [ism_of]{.subs} (as the [muxbar3]{.subs}) and an [xabar]{.subs} (as the [muxbar]{.subs}).
And
a _[j_f3l]{.subs}_ is one whose [3umdah]{.subs} elements are a verb (as the [muxbar3]{.subs}) and and its [faa3il]{.subs} (as the [muxbar]{.subs}).

Consider, for example, the following sentence:

(@) [بَلْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Rather Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence above is [بَلْ]{.ar}.
It is a particle and not a [3umdah]{.subs} element.
Removing it from the sentence, we see that the remaining [3umdah]{.subs} elements are two nouns:
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} (the [mubtada]{.subs}) and [قَائِمٌ]{.ar} (as the [xabar]{.subs}).
So the sentence is a [j_ism]{.subs}.

Let's take a look at another example:

(@) [زَيْدًا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 28]{.citex}  
    [[It was] Zayd I saw.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence is [زَيْدًا]{.ar}.
It is a [mafulb]{.subs}.
We learned in section\ (ref) above that a [mafulb]{.subs} is not usually a [3umdah]{.subs} element.
Rather,
it is usually a [fadlah]{.subs} elements
Stripping the sentence of this [fadlah]{.subs} element, we are left with
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} [I saw]{.trans}.
This is a [j_f3l]{.subs}.
The verb [رَأى]{.ar} is the [muxbar]{.subs} and its [faa3il]{.subs}, the pronoun [تُ]{.ar}, is the [muxbar3]{.subs}.

<!--

## The hybrid sentence

Some sentences do not fall neatly into the categories of a [j_ism]{.subs} or a [j_f3l]{.subs}.
We will refer to such sentences as hybrid sentences.

One example of a hybrid sentence is one that has the verb [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Example:

(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 171]{.citex}  
    [Zayd was standing]{.trans}

On the surface, 
example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above
looks like a verbal sentence because it begins with
[كَانَ]{.ar}, which is a verb.
Its [faa3il]{.subs}
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the [muxbar3]{.subs}, as usual.
But
[كَانَ]{.ar}, as used above,
is a [naqis]{.subs} verb
(see chapter\ (ref).)
This means that it does not have sufficient meaning to [isnaad_comp]{.subs} the sentence by itself.
So it cannot be a [3umdah]{.subs} [muxbar]{.subs}.
Instead,
[كَانَ]{.ar}
requires a [xabar]{.subs} 
([قَائِمًا]{.ar} above)
to be the [muxbar]{.subs}.

In such a sentence,
[كَانَ]{.ar}
can be considered to be the [pregov]{.subs}, and the sentence may be considered a [j_ism]{.subs}.

Similarly consider the sentence:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the [0state]{.subs}.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a [naqis]{.subs} verb, is not an [3umdah]{.subs} element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the [muxbar3]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the [ustate]{.subs}
and the [muxbar]{.subs} [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the [astate]{.subs}.
Therefore both [لَمْ]{.ar} and [يَكُنْ]{.ar} form the [pregov]{.subs}.

[كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).
-->
<!--
Similarly, consider the sentence:

(@) [ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 171]{.citex}  
    [I believed him [to be] standing.]{.trans}

The sentence above begins with the verb [ظَنَّ]{.ar},
which would normally make this a [j_f3l]{.subs}.
But the sentence with just the verb and its [faa3il]{.subs} 
[ظَنَنْتُ]{.ar}
[I believed]{.trans}
seems incomplete.

[ظَنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).
-->
<!--
We will see another example of a hybrid sentence in section\ (aqaaimun zaydun).
-->


<!--
## Identifying the [3umdah]{.subs} elements

### Identifying the [3umdah]{.subs} elements in a [j_f3l]{.subs}

Identifying the [3umdah]{.subs} elements in a [j_f3l]{.subs} is relatively straightforward.
The [muxbar3]{.subs} is always the [faa3il]{.subs} of the verb.
And 
except in the case of a [naqis]{.subs} verb,
the [muxbar]{.subs} is usually the verb.
We saw an example of the [3umdah]{.subs} elements of a [j_f3l]{.subs} in example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above.

In the case of a [naqis]{.subs} verb,
like [كَانَ]{.ar},
the verb does not complete the sentence grammatically.
So the [mafulb]{.subs} of the verb becomes the [muxbar]{.subs}.
We saw an example of the [3umdah]{.subs} elements of a [j_f3l]{.subs} with a [naqis]{.subs} verb in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.
-->

## Identifying the [3umdah]{.subs} elements in a [j_ism]{.subs}

It can sometimes be complicated to tell
which of the twp [3umdah]{.subs} elements in a [j_ism]{.subs} is the [muxbar3]{.subs} and which is the [muxbar]{.subs}.
We will discuss several cases below:

### When there is an overt [pregov]{.subs}

When there is an overt [pregov]{.subs},
like [إِنَّ]{.ar},
[كَانَ]{.ar}, etc.,
then it is usually easy to tell which is the [muxbar3]{.subs} and which is the [muxbar]{.subs}.
For example:

(@3amal_fainna_hasbaka_allahu) [فَإِنَّ حَسۡبَكَ ٱللَّهُ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأنفال]{.ar} 8:62](https://quran.com/8/62)]{.citex}  
    [then sufficient for you is Allāh]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_fainna_hasbaka_allahu) above,
[حَسْب]{.ar} is in the [astate]{.subs} as the [ism_of]{.subs} and 
the word [ٱللَّهُ]{.ar} is in the [ustate]{.subs} as the [xabar]{.subs}.
This tells us that
[حَسْب]{.ar} is the [muxbar3]{.subs} and the word
[ٱللَّهُ]{.ar} is the [muxbar]{.subs}.


### One [3umdah]{.subs} element is definite and the other [3umdah]{.subs} element is indefinite

When 
one [3umdah]{.subs} element is definite and the other [3umdah]{.subs} element is indefinite,
then it is usually the case that the definite element is the [muxbar3]{.subs} (as the [mubtada]{.subs})
and the indefinite element is the [muxbar]{.subs} (as the [xabar]{.subs}).

In terms of pragmatics, the [muxbar3]{.subs} and the [muxbar]{.subs} represent 'given' and 'new' information.
That is, the listener knows who the [muxbar3]{.subs} is and can identify him or it. So the [muxbar3]{.subs} is a 'given' to the listener.
And the speaker is providing 'new' information about the [muxbar3]{.subs} to the listener.
The definite element represents the 'given' information, which the listener already knows.
And the indefinite element represents 'new' information.

Let's take a look at an example:

(@3amal_tamimiyyun_ana) [تَمِيمِيٌّ أَنَا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 121]{.citex}  
    [A [#tamIm]{.trn2}ite I am.]{.trans}

The pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} is definite. Therefore it is the [muxbar3]{.subs} (as the [mubtada]{.subs}).
And the word
[تَمِيمِيٌّ]{.ar}
is indefinite.
Therefore it is the [muxbar]{.subs} (as the [xabar]{.subs}).
Example (@3amal_tamimiyyun_ana) is an inverted order sentence where the [xabar]{.subs} is fronted and the [mubtada]{.subs} is placed after it.

In special cases, some grammarians hold that it is possible to have an indefinite [mubtada]{.subs} and a definite [xabar]{.subs}.^[<https://alababmisr.com/%D8%B3%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE/>]
One special case is when a question noun is the [mubtada]{.subs}.
(Question nouns are considered indefinite.)
For example:

(@) [كَمْ مَالُكَ]{.ar}
    [[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/231]{.citex}  
    [How much is your wealth?]{.trans}

(@) [أَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ]{.ar}
    [[[جامع الترمذي]{.ar} :3513](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3513)]{.citex}  
    [Which night is the night of Decree]{.trans}

Another special case is when the [mubtada]{.subs} is an indefinite [af3al]{.subs} in sentences like:

(@) [خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/231]{.citex}  
    [Better than you is Zayd]{.trans}

In the above sentence, [خَيْرٌ]{.ar} is considered the [mubtada]{.subs} of the sentence.
<!--
Typically, an indefinite [af3al]{.subs} would be a [xabar]{.subs} instead of a [mubtada]{.subs}.
For example: zaydun xayrun minka.
But imagine a scenario where someone says:
3amrun xayrun minni.
In response to this, another person may reply
xayrun minka zaydun.
The given information is xayrun minka.
And the new information is zayd.
-->
<!--
Besides these two special cases,
there are words like
[حَسْب]{.ar},
[مِثْل]{.ar},
[نَحْو]{.ar}, etc.
We will see in chapter\ (ref) that these words (exceptionally) remain indefinite when annexed to a definite noun.
So, for example, these words (as [mudaf]{.subs}s to definite [mudafil]{.subs}s) may be used as [na3t]{.subs}s to an indefinite noun.
For example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسْبِكَ ِمْن َرُجٍل]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/139]{.citex}

There is some debate amongst the grammarians with regards to whether these indefinite noun may occur as a [mubtada]{.subs} to a definite [xabar]{.subs}.^[[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/277]
So if we have a sentence: 

(@) [حسبُك زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Sufficient for you is Zayd.]{.trans}

then one may deem zayd as the [mubtada]{.subs} because it is more definite than hasbuka.

But see also the [tafsir]{.subs}s of the following [ayah]{.subs}s:

(@) faHasbuhu jahannamu

(@) Hasbuhum jahannamu yaSlawnahA
-->

### Both [3umdah]{.subs} elements are definite

When both [3umdah]{.subs} elements are definite, then typically the first is the [mubtada]{.subs} and the second is the [xabar]{.subs}.
For example:

(@) [الدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ]{.ar}
    [[[صحيح مسلم]{.ar} :55a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:55a)]{.citex}  
    [The Religion is sincerity.]{.trans}

However, if it is known from context that one if the two elements is the 'given' information and the other is the 'new' information,
then the given information will be the [mubtada]{.subs} and the new information will be the [xabar]{.subs}, regardless of word-order.^[[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/233](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/232); [[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/168](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/167)]

For example, consider a situation where one wishes to say, 
"[#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is [like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}."
([#imAm #abU #yUsuf]{.trn2}
was the foremost student of
[#imAm #abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}.)
The normal way to express this sentence is:

(@3amal_abu_hanifah_abu_yusuf) [أَبُو يُوسُفَ أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar}
    [[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/233](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/232)]{.citex}  
    [[#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is [like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

However, if it is pragmatically known that the topic of the sentence is 
[أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar},
then it is 'given' that
[أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar}
is the [muxbar3]{.subs} (as the [mubtada]{.subs}).
Similarly, it is known that likening him to
[أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar}
is the 'new' information.
Therefore,
[أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar} is the [muxbar]{.subs} (as the [xabar]{.subs}).
In this case, the sentence order can be flexible, and the [xabar]{.subs} can be fronted (stylistically), for the same meaning, thus:

(@) [أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar}  
    [[Like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}, [#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

### Both [3umdah]{.subs} elements are indefinite

When both [3umdah]{.subs} elements are indefinite then,
again,
the first is likely to be the [mubtada]{.subs}
and the second to be the [xabar]{.subs}.
Examples:

(@) [أَفْضَلُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/232](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/231#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[The person] better than Zayd is better than [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [وَجَزَ ٰ⁠ۤؤُا۟ سَیِّئَةࣲ سَیِّئَةࣱ مِّثۡلُهَاۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الشورى]{.ar} 42:40](https://quran.com/42/40)]{.citex}  
    [And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it]{.trans}

## The [xabar]{.subs} as a complete sentence

In a [j_ism]{.subs},
the [xabar]{.subs} is, by default, a single noun.
See example (@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) again:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun),
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is a single word and it is the [xabar]{.subs}.
This is what we may call a _simple_ [j_ism]{.subs}.

In contrast,
in a _compound_ [j_ism]{.subs},
the [xabar]{.subs} is itself a complete sentence.
For example:

(@3amal_zaydun_yaqoomu) [زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- he stands]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_yaqoomu) above,
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the [mubtada]{.subs} and
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is the [xabar]{.subs}.
But 
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is not a single word here.
It is in fact a complete sentence.
This is because, as we know, a verb _must_ be followed by its [faa3il]{.subs}.
And if there is no overt [faa3il]{.subs}, then a [mustatir]{.subs} [faa3il]{.subs} pronoun is implicated.
So [يَقُومُ]{.ar} is a a [j_f3l]{.subs} with the meaning
[he stands]{.trans}.

Here is example of a compound [j_ism]{.subs}, whose [xabar]{.subs} is also a [j_ism]{.subs}:

(@3amal_zaydun_aboohu_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/26](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/1040)]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father is standing.]{.trans}

(FIXME: MOVE THIS TO KAANA CHAPTER):

Compound sentences are very common with [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Remember from section\ (ref) above that
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is a [naqis]{.subs} verb, and thus needs a [xabar]{.subs} to grammatically the sentence.
This [xabar]{.subs} may be a single word, like:

(@) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was standing.]{.trans}

Or the [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} may be a complete sentence:

(@) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd used to stand.]{.trans}

(END FIXME)

The [xabar]{.subs} of a compound [j_ism]{.subs} is typically a [xabari]{.subs} sentence.
But it need not be so.
A [inshai]{.subs} sentence is also valid as a [xabar]{.subs}^[[شرح جمل الزجاجي لابن عصفور]{.ar} 1/347; [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/27]
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar}
    [[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/27]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- hit him!]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [Hit Zayd!]{.trans})

### The government of the compound [j_ism]{.subs} sentence

The [xabar]{.subs} of a compound [j_ism]{.subs} is a complete sentence.
Therefore, it has its own independent internal government for all elements within it
(including its own [pregov]{.subs}).
But the _entire_ [xabar]{.subs} is governed, albeit not markedly,  by a governor in the outer sentence.
For example, consider the following compound [j_ism]{.subs}:

(@3amal_zaydun_lam_yadrib_3amran) [زَيْدٌ لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- he did not hit [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_lam_yadrib_3amran) above,
[لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is a complete sentence that is the [xabar]{.subs} of the outer sentence.
This inner sentence has its own internal government,
starting with its [pregov]{.subs} [لَمْ]{.ar}.
The [pregov]{.subs} [لَمْ]{.ar}
governs the verb [يَضْرِبْ]{.ar} in the [0state]{.subs}.
And the verb [يَضْرِبْ]{.ar}
governs an implicated [mustatir]{.subs} [faa3il]{.subs} pronoun ([هُوَ]{.ar}) in the [ustate]{.subs},
and the [mafulb]{.subs} [عَمْرًا]{.ar} in the [astate]{.subs}.

We will say that the inner sentence 
[لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is _in place_ of a [ustate]{.subs} noun as the [xabar]{.subs} of the outer sentence.

The government of this compound sentence is illustrated in the diagram below:

DIAGRAM

<!--
The governments of the other examples of compound sentences that we gave above, is ilustrated in the diagrams below:
-->

### Invalid inner sentences

Some sentences are not valid as inner sentences:

* A sentence beginning with [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}, [حَتَّى]{.ar}, or [بَلْ]{.ar} is not valid.^[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]
* A vocative sentence is not valid.^[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]
  So. we cannot say, for example:

  (@) [x]{.subs} [زيد يا أخاه]{.ar}
      [[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]{.citex}  
      "Zayd -- O his brother."

### The [rabt]{.subs} between the inner and outer sentence

It is usually necessary for there to be a [rabt]{.subs} between the inner sentence, and the [mubtada]{.subs} of the outer sentence.
This [rabt]{.subs} is typically supplied by a pronoun.
Let's look at some examples:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaama_aboohu) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}
    [[المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father stood up.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaama_aboohu) above, the [rabt]{.subs} is the pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in abuuhu.

(@3amal_zaydun_qaama) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ]{.ar}
    [[المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- he stood up.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaama) above, the [rabt]{.subs} is the implied singular masculine pronoun that is the [faa3il]{.subs} of [قَامَ]{.ar}.

Generally, if there is no such [rabt]{.subs} between the inner sentence and the [mubtada]{.subs} of the outer sentence,
then the compound sentence is invalid.^[Peled, _Sentence types_ 94 citing [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]{.ar}; [المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar}]{.citex}
So we cannot say, for example:

(@) [x]{.subs} [زَيْدٌ قَامَ عَمْرٌ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 94 citing [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]{.ar}]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- [#eamr]{.trn2} stood up]{.trans}

#### A [ism_isharah]{.subs} as the [rabt]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

Instead of a pronoun,
an [ism_isharah]{.subs} may serve as the [rabt]{.subs}.
For example:

(@) [وَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ خَیۡرࣱۚ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأعراف]{.ar} 7:26](https://quran.com/7/26) cited by [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [But the clothing of righteousness - that is best.]{.trans}

#### A repeated [mubtada]{.subs} as the [rabt]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [mubtada]{.subs} of the outer sentence may be repeated in the inner sentence, and this is sufficient as the [rabt]{.subs}.
For example:

(@) [ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝١ مَا ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝٢]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الحاقة]{.ar} 69:1-2](https://quran.com/69/1-2) cited by [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [The Inevitable Reality - What is the Inevitable Reality?]{.trans}


#### No need for the [rabt]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

In cases where the [xabar]{.subs} of the outer sentence is more general than its [mubtada]{.subs} a [rabt]{.subs} is not needed.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- an excellent man]{.trans}

The [rabt]{.subs} is also not needed when the [mubtada]{.subs} of the outer sentence and its [xabar]{.subs} are perfectly identical in meaning.
For example:

(@) [نُطْقِي اللَّهُ حَسْبِي]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [My utterance is "[#allAh]{.trn2} is sufficient for me."]{.trans}

(@) [قَوْلِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [My saying is "There is no god but [#allAh]{.trn2}."]{.trans}

#### An implied [rabt]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The [rabt]{.subs}, even when technically required, is sometimes omitted.
But it remains implied.
This is in cases in which the sense is perfectly clear without it.^[Wright 2/256B]
For example:

(@) [ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256C; [المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278; [شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 1/238]{.citex}  
    [The ghee is (at the rate of) two [manA]{.trn2}s for a dirham.]{.trans}  

In the example above,
the sentence with the [rabt]{.subs} restored is 
[ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ **مِنْهُ** بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar} 
[two [manA]{.trn2}s **of it** for a dirham.]{.trans}



## Other complete sentences in place of nouns

It is not only the [xabar]{.subs} which can be replaced with a complete sentence.
Other grammatical categories are also, by default, a single noun, but which can be replaced with complete sentences.
We will discuss some of these categories below,
and treat other categories in their respective chapters
(like the [hal]{.subs}, the [jawab_shart]{.subs}, and [af3aal_quloob]{.subs}).

<!--
### The [naib]{.subs} [faa3il]{.subs} as a complete sentence
-->

### The [mafulb]{.subs} as a complete sentence

A sentence which is direct speech occurs in the place of a [mafulb]{.subs}.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة مريم]{.ar} 19:30](https://quran.com/19/30) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/23](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/32#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh.]{.trans}

In the example above, the sentence 
[إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ]{.ar}
is in place of the [astate]{.subs} [mafulb]{.subs} of [قَالَ]{.ar}.

A complete sentence can also occur as a [mafulb]{.subs} with [af3aal_quloob]{.subs}.
Examples:

(@) [ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا يَقْرَأُ]{.ar}
    [[[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/24](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/33#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I believed Zayd [to be] reading.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the [j_f3l]{.subs}
[يَقْرَأُ]{.ar}
is in place of the [astate]{.subs} [mafulb]{.subs} of [ظَنَنْتُ]{.ar}.
We will learn more about this category in chapter\ (ref), [ia]{.subs}.

### The [na3t]{.subs} as a complete sentence

The [na3t]{.subs} is,
in principle,
a single noun.

However, an sentence entire sentence may occur in place of the single noun.
For example, instead of saying
[مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ قَائِمٍ]{.ar},
we can replace
the single word [na3t]{.subs}
[قَائِمٍ]{.ar}
with the sentence
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَقُومُ]{.ar}
    [[الإيضاح للفارسي]{.ar} 308]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man [that] stands.]{.trans}  
    (literally: [I passed by a 'he stands' man.]{.trans}

Note that the [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is in the [ustate]{.subs}.
This is because
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is a complete sentence (with an implied [faa3il]{.subs} pronoun).
So it has its own internal government that is not affected by any element in the outer sentence.
Thus, the state of the [manut]{.subs}
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar} has no effect on any state within the sentence-[na3t]{.subs}.
However, the entire sentence [na3t]{.subs} is _in place_ of a [istate]{.subs} noun as the [na3t]{.subs} of 
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar}.

Substituing a single-noun [na3t]{.subs} with its corresponding [mudarie]{.subs} verb is the most basic form of the sentence-[na3t]{.subs}.
However, more complex sentence-[na3t]{.subs}s may also be formed.
For example:

(@3amal_quran_2_281) [وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة البقرة]{.ar} 2:281](https://quran.com/2/281) cited by [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/276]{.citex}  
    [And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allāh.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_quran_2_281) above,
the sentence
[تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ]{.quran}
is a [na3t]{.subs} of [يَوْمًا]{.ar}.

<!--
Also note that when we translate such sentences into English, we need to use a _relative pronoun_ like
_that_, _which_, _who_, etc.
But in Arabic no such relative pronoun is needed or used.
Arabic does have the equivalent of the relative pronoun, called the _[ism_mawsul]{.subs}_,
but it has its own use cases.
We will discuss the [ism_mawsul]{.subs} in chapter\ (ref), [ia]{.subs}.
-->

There are three conditions that must be met in order for a sentence to occur as a [na3t]{.subs}^:
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/275--278]{.citex}  

1. The [manut]{.subs} must be indefinite, either in wording or in meaning.
2. The sentence-[na3t]{.subs} must contain a [rabt]{.subs} that links back to the [manut]{.subs}.
2. The sentence-[na3t]{.subs} should be [xabari]{.subs}.

Let's discuss each of these conditions.

#### Indefiniteness of the [manut]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

We already saw an example of an indefinite (in wording) [manut]{.subs} in example (@3amal_quran_2_281) above.
Here is an example of a [manut]{.subs} which is definite in wording, but indefinite in meaning:

(@3amal_walaqad_amurru) [وَلَقَدْ أَمُرُّ عَلَى اللَّئِيمِ يَسُبُّنِي]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/276]{.citex}  
    [And indeed I pass by the ignoble [person that] insults me]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_walaqad_amurru)
the [manut]{.subs} [اللَّئِيمِ]{.ar} is referring to a general person, and is therefore indefinite in meaning.

#### A [rabt]{.subs} that links back to the [manut]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

In example (@3amal_quran_2_281), the [rabt]{.subs},
which links back to the [manut]{.subs} [يَوْمًا]{.ar},
is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in [فِيهِ]{.ar}.

Sometimes the [rabt]{.subs} is not explicit, but is implied.
For example:

(@) [وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا لَّا تَجۡزِی نَفۡسٌ عَن نَّفۡسࣲ شَیۡـࣰٔا]{.quran}
    [[[سورة البقرة]{.ar} 2:123](https://quran.com/2/123) cited by [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/277]{.citex}  
    [And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all]{.trans}

The implied [rabt]{.subs}
is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in an implied [فِيهِ]{.ar},
i.e. [لَا تَجْزِی **فِيهِ**]{.ar}.

#### The sentence-[na3t]{.subs} should be [xabari]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

The following sentence is impermissible because the [na3t]{.subs} [اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar} is a [inshai]{.subs} sentence.

(@) [x]{.subs} [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/278]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man -- hit him]{.trans}
    
### The [mudafil]{.subs} in an [idaafah]{.subs} as a complete sentence

The [mudafil]{.subs} in an [idaafah]{.subs} may be a complete sentence instead of a single noun.
For example:

(@3amal_yawmu_yanfa3) [هَـٰذَا یَوۡمُ یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّـٰدِقِینَ صِدۡقُهُمۡۚ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة المائدة]{.ar} 5:119](https://quran.com/5/119) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/28](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/37)]{.citex}  
    [This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_yawmu_yanfa3) above the entire sentence
[یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّادِقِینَ صِدْقُهُمْ]{.ar}
is the [mudafil]{.subs} to the [mudaf]{.subs} [يَوْمُ]{.ar}.
As with sentence-[xabar]{.subs}s and sentence-[na3t]{.subs}s,
the sentence-[mudafil]{.subs} has its own internal government.
And the sentence-[mudafil]{.subs} is _in place_ of an [istate]{.subs} noun.

Here is another example:

(@) [یَوۡمَ هُم بَـٰرِزُونَۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة غافر]{.ar} 40:16](https://quran.com/40/16) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/29](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/38#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Day they come forth]{.trans}

## A foreign element separating a governor from its governee

A foreign element is one that is not _directly_ governed by a governor.
In most cases,
a foreign element should not come between (and thus separate) a governor from its governee(s).
For example, consider the following sentence:

(@) [عَلِمْتُ مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا]{.ar}
    [[الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 66]{.citex}  
    [I knew [#muHammad]{.trn2} [to be] writing a book.]{.trans}

In the example above the [j_f3l]{.subs}
[يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is in place of the second [mafulb]{.subs} of
[عَلِمْتُ]{.ar}.
The noun
[كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is governed directly by the verb
[يُؤَلِّفُ]{.ar}.
So 
[كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is a foreign element for the verb
[عَلِمْتُ]{.ar}.
Therefore, the following sentence is impermissible:

(@) [x]{.subs} [عَلِمْتُ كِتَابًا مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ]{.ar}
    [[الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 66]{.citex}  


## The [damir_shan]{.subs}

Usually, for pronouns, the pronoun's referent is a single noun that occurs before it.
For example,
if we say 

(@) [زَيْدٌ هَوَ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}

Then the pronoun
[هُوَ]{.ar}
refers to the noun [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} which occurs before it.

There is a special pronoun, called the _[damir_shan]{.subs}_
([ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ]{.ar})
that behaves differently from other pronouns
It is used to begin compound [j_ism]{.subs}s.
Here is an example of a sentence with a [damir_shan]{.subs}:

(@) [هُوَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/57](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/56)]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}  

The pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} is the [damir_shan]{.subs}
It is the [mubtada]{.subs} of the outer sentence.
Its [xabar]{.subs} is the inner sentence
[زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}.
What the [damir_shan]{.subs} is referring to
is explained by the entire sentence
[زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
that occurs after it.

The [damir_shan]{.subs} is typically used for statements that are momentous.
Consider, for example, a situation where one hears some hubbub, and wonders,
"What is the state of affairs that is causing this hubbub?"
The answer to this question is:

(@3amal_huwa_alameeru_muqbilun) [هُوَ الأَمِيرُ مُقْبِلٌ]{.ar}
    [[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/464]{.citex}  
    [It is: the commander is approaching.]{.trans}  
    (the pronoun "it" is referring to "the state of affairs".)

This pronoun is often left untranslated.
So example (@3amal_huwa_alameeru_muqbilun) may simply be translated as
[The commander is approaching.]{.trans}

Here are some rules and guidelines regarding the [damir_shan]{.subs}:

#### The gender of the [damir_shan]{.subs} {.unnumbered}

If the [mubtada]{.subs} of the following sentence is masculine,
then the [damir_shan]{.subs} is generally the masculine pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar}.
And
if the [mubtada]{.subs} of the following sentence is feminine,
then the [damir_shan]{.subs} is generally the feminine pronoun [هِيَ]{.ar}.
Examples:

(@) [**هُوَ** زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هِيَ** هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.]{.trans}

As mentioned,
the gender of the [damir_shan]{.subs} generally matches the gender of the following [mubtada]{.subs} (as above).
Sometimes, however, it is found to mismatch. For example:

(@) [**هِيَ** زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هُوَ** هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745--756]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.]{.trans}

#### The [damir_shan]{.subs} is always a singular pronoun {.unnumbered}

The [damir_shan]{.subs} is always a singular pronoun, regardless of whether the subject of the following [mubtada]{.subs} is singular, dual, or plural.^[[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]

(@) [**هُوَ** الزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ]{.ar}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: the two Zayds are standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هِيَ** الْهِنْدَاتُ قَائِمَاتٌ]{.ar}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: the Hinds are standing.]{.trans}

#### The [damir_shan]{.subs} is always a pronoun for the [third]{.subs} person {.unnumbered}

Even if the [mubtada]{.subs} of the inner sentence is a pronoun for the [first]{.subs} or [second]{.subs} persons,
the [damir_shan]{.subs} is always a pronoun of for the [third]{.subs} person.
For example:

(@) [هُوَ أَنَا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[The fact] is: I am Zayd.]{.trans}  

The sentence 
[أَنَا أَنَا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is possible, but in this case the pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} is not a [damir_shan]{.subs}.
Rather it is repeated for emphasis.^[[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]

#### The [damir_shan]{.subs}s [هُوَ]{.ar} and [هِيَ]{.ar} only introduce [j_ism]{.subs}s {.unnumbered}

The [damir_shan]{.subs}s [هُوَ]{.ar} and [هِيَ]{.ar} only introduce [j_ism]{.subs}s.^[[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/467]
This can be seen in the examples above.

We will see, in sections\ (kaana) and (inna),
that the [damir_shan]{.subs} can also be used with
[كَانَ]{.ar} and [إِنَّ]{.ar} (and its sisters).
In these cases, the [damir_shan]{.subs} may introduce [j_f3l]{.subs}s.
For example:

(@) [فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعۡمَى ٱلۡأَبۡصَـٰرُ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الحج]{.ar} 22:46](https://quran.com/22/46) cited by [شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/467]{.citex}  
    [For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded]{.trans}
