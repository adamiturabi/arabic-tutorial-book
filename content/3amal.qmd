# Sentence and government theory

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will study the Arabic grammatical model for constructing sentences.
We will first define some linguistic terms.

### Truth-evaluability

Statements are classified into two types:

 i. a truth-evaluable statement
ii. a non-truth-evaluable statement

A _truth-evaluable_ statement is one that can be judged to be true or false.
In other words it is falsifiable.
For example, if we have a statement:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The above statement may be judged to have a truth value.
If zayd is actually standing, then the statement is true.
And if zayd is not standing, then the statement is false.

A _non-truth-evaluable_ statement,
on the other hand,
does not have a truth value.
Here are some examples of non-truth-evaluable statements:

(@) [اضْرِبْ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    [Beat Zayd!]{.trans}

(@) [لَا تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}  
    [Don't do [it]!]{.trans}

(@) [يَا زَيْدُ]{.ar}  
    [O Zayd]{.trans}

(@) [مَنْ هُوَ]{.ar}  
    [Who is he?]{.trans}


### Syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics

#### Syntax and semantics {.unnumbered}

_Semantics_ is the study of the meanings of words.
And _syntax_ is the study of how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships between the words in a sentence.
For example, consider the adjectival noun [كَبِير]{.ar}.
Semantically, it gives the meaning of something being big.
When it is in a linguistic environment, like a phrase or a sentence,
then its syntactical role is determined by the grammatical relationships it has with other words in the sentence.

Consider the following sentence:

(@) [الْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
    [The house is big]{.trans}

In the above sentence, 
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is _syntactically_ a info.

Now consider the following sentence:

(@) [دَخَلَ بَيْتًا كَبِيرًا]{.ar}  
    [He entered a big house.]{.trans}

Now the same noun
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is syntactically a attribute.
In both examples,
[كَبِير]{.ar} has the same semantic signification.

<!--
#### Semantics {.unnumbered}

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words.
Consider the following sentence:

(@) taHaddatha fi al-bayt.

Here the semantic meaning of fi determines the meaning of the sentence.
If fi means "in" then the sentence means "He talked in the house."
And if fi means "regarding", then the sentence means "He talked about the house."

Semantics can affect the syntax of a sentence.

(@) al-af3Alu Hasanatun  
    "The acts are good."

(@) al-af3Alu HasanAtun  
    "The acts are good deeds."
-->

#### Pragmatics {.unnumbered}

<!--
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in context, and with regard to needs of the speaker and the listener.
-->
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in a specific context or situation.


<!--
#### Functional aspects {.unnumbered}

Semantics and pragmatics
-->

#### Stylistics {.unnumbered}

In order to express a meaning, there will often be a normal way to choose words or construct a sentence's structure.
If, for some effect (rhetorical, persuasive, literary, etc.), the speaker chooses to deviate from this norm,
then he is doing so for stylistic reasons.^[Hickey, L, "Stylistics, Pragmatics, and Pragmastylistics"]


## The theory of government

A sentence in Arabic is constituted from elements.
An element can be a noun, a verb, or a particle.
Of these elements, some have the quality of state.
These are called _stateful_ elements.
The stateful elements are nouns and stateful verbs.
A noun may be either in the u-state, a-state, or i-state.
And a stateful verb may be either in the u-state, a-state, or 0-state.
The theory of government states that a stateful element is put in a particular state by a _governor_.
For example:

(@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    [in the house]{.trans}

In the above example,
<!--
the particle fii is the governor of the noun al-daari.
The noun al-daar is the governee of its governor fii.
-->
the gpreposition [فِي]{.ar} causes the noun [الدَّار]{.ar} to be in the i-state.
So we say that 
the governor [فِي]{.ar} _governs_ [الدَّار]{.ar} (the _governee_) in the i-state.
<!--
We say that
the preposition fii is the governor of i-state noun al-daar because it is the reason or cause of the noun al-daar being in the i-state.

Here is another example:

(@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr) Daraba zaydun eamran.

In this example, the governor is the verb Daraba.
It has two governees:
the doer zayd,
and the direct doee eamr.
The governor Daraba governs the doer zayd in the u-state
and it governs the direct doee in the a-state.

#### A governee can only have one governor  {.unnumbered}

From example (@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr),
you can see that one goveror may govern multiple governees.
However, one governee cannot be be governed by multiple governors.
In other words, there can be only one governor that causes a stateful element to be in a particular state.

#### The word-order of a governor and its governee(s)  {.unnumbered}

From the above examples,
you can see that a governor typically occurs before its governees in word-order.
For some governor-governee relationships, this word-order is obligatory,
like in example (@3amal_in_house).
For other governor-governee relationships, this word-order is more flexible.
For example, the doee may occur before its governing verb, thus:

(@3amal_3amran_Daraba_zaydun) eamran Daraba zaydun

<!--
But the doer must always follow its governing verb.
So that is another example of an obligatory word-order for the governor and the governee.
-->

## Some common governees

Let's look at some common governor-governee relationships.
We will make use of the following example:

(@) [قَرَأَ الْغُلَامُ الطَّوِيلُ كِتَابَ الجَارِيَةِ فِي الدَّارِ الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}

#### The i-state noun {.unnumbered}

A noun in the i-state is governed by a preceding preposition or annexe noun.
We have already seen that the
i-state noun [الدَّار]{.ar} is governed by the preceding preposition [فِي]{.ar}.
<!--
We saw an example of a governing preposition in (@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar} above.
-->
We also see that the i-state base noun [الجَارِيَةِ]{.ar}
is governed by the annexe noun [كِتَابَ]{.ar}.

#### The doer {.unnumbered}

The doer of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its doer [الْغُلَامُ]{.ar} in the u-state.

#### The direct doee {.unnumbered}

The direct doee is also governed by its verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its direct doee [كِتَابَ]{.ar} in the a-state.

#### The attribute {.unnumbered}

A attribute is governed by governor of its attributee.
In our example, the attribute [الطَّوِيلُ]{.ar} is governed in the u-state by [قَرَأَ]{.ar}, which is the governor of its attributee
[الْغُلَامُ]{.ar}.
Similarly, the attribute
[الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}
is governed in the i-state by the preposition [فِي]{.ar} because [فِي]{.ar} also governs its attributee [الدَّارِ]{.ar}.

<!--
Here is an example of an i-state noun 
([زَيْدٍ]{.ar})
being governed by a preceding annexe noun
([كِتَابُ]{.ar}):

(@) [كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd's book]{.trans}

#### The doer {.unnumbered}

The doer of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its doer
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the u-state.

#### The direct doee {.unnumbered}

The doer of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its doer
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the u-state.
-->

#### Ungoverned elements {.unnumbered}

Not every element in a sentence is governed by a governor.
For example, the perfect verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} has no state, and thus, no governor.

Here is a diagram depicting the above governor-governee relationships:

DIAGRAM

## The two structural elements of a sentence

In the Arabic grammatical model,
a sentence is analagous to the structure of a simple _lean-to_ building.
<!--
A building is built upon a foundation.
The foundation of the Arabic sentence
-->
This structure
requires two _structural_ elements
in order to be structurally complete.^[Wright 2/250ff; [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 13ff]
These two structural elements are:

 i. The structure-starter
ii. The structure-completer

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]

\draw[pattern=north west lines, pattern, draw=none] (0,0) rectangle (6,-0.4);
\draw (0,0) -- (6,0);
\draw[fill=lightgray] (2,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=90] {structure-starter} (2.4, 5);
\draw[fill=lightgray, rotate around={30:(5.05,-0.3)}] (5.05,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=-60] {structure-completer} (5.45, 6);

\end{tikzpicture}
```


The structure-starter is the primary structural element.
It represents whom the sentence is about, i.e. its topic.
The structure-completer rests against the structure-starter.
<!--
And the structure-completer is meant to provide some interesting comment about the structure-starter.
-->
It expresses some property about the structure-starter that completes the meaning of the sentence.

Once the two structural elements are in place,
the sentence is structurally complete.
Other _dispensable_ elements
(see section\ (ref) below)
may be added in addition to the structural elements to add meaning to the sentence,
but they are not required to make the sentence structurally complete.

Let's look at the structural elements for the two types of Arabic sentences:

<!--
Here are some examples of sentences with only structural elements:
-->

### The structural elements of a nounal sentence

In a nounal sentence the subject is the structure-starter and the info is the structure-completer.
Consider the following nounal sentence:

(@3amal_zayd_qaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_zayd_qaimun) above is a nounal sentence.
The subject [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the structure-starter. It is the topic of the sentence.
The info
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is the structure-completer.
It is a comment on the topic, giving us some information about
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a nounal sentence.
In this nounal sentence the subject is the structure-starter,
and the info is the structure-completer.
-->

### The structural elements of a verbal sentence

In a verbal sentence the verb is the structure-completer and its doer is the structure-starter.
Consider the following verbal sentence:

(@3amal_qaama_zaydun) [قَامَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above is a verbal sentence.
The doer
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the structure-starter. It is the topic of the sentence.
And the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} is the structure-completer. It is a comment on the topic.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a verbal sentence.
In this verbal sentence the verb is the structure-completer,
and the doer is the structure-starter.
-->
<!--
We will see later, if Allāh wills that 
in a verbal sentence
the structure-completer may sometimes be another element, instead of the verb that governs the doer.
-->

## Foundational government

<!--
Besides the two structural elements,
a sentence also needs an foundational government.[Owens §2.3.6.1 54]
-->
In order to build a sentence from the structural elements,
a sentence needs _foundational government_.[Owens §2.3.6.1, 54]
<!--
The foundational government governs the highest governing element(s) of the two structural elements of the sentence.
-->
<!--
The foundational government is the source of all government in the sentence.
-->
Foundational government is any and all government prior to, and until, the first governed structural element.

#### One of the two structural elements is the foundational government {.unnumbered}

In some sentences, the intitial governor may be one of the two structural elements.
In example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above,
the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} governs its doer [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
The perfect verb [قَامَ]{.ar} has no state and thus needs no governor.
So it is, itself, the foundational government.

DIAGRAM

#### Another (non-structural) element is the foundational government {.unnumbered}

The intitial governor may be internal to the sentence but not one of the two structural elements.
<!--
In such cases,
even though the foundational government is not one of the two structural elements,
we don't call it an dispensable element.
-->

Here are some examples:

(@) [لَمْ يَضْرِبِ الرَّجُلُ غُلَامَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [Owens,\ J., _The foundations of grammar_ §2.2.3, 41]{.citex}  
    [The man did not beat Zayd's slave.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM
    
<!--
(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above,
the verb [كَانَ]{.ar} is the foundational government.
But because it is a deficient verb, it does not complete the sentence grammatically.
Therefore, it is not an structural element.
But it is needed to govern the structural elements.
-->

#### The abstract foundational government {.unnumbered}

Very commonly, the foundational government is not an actual word, but only an abstract concept.
When there is one or more stateful structural elements in a sentence with no overt (i.e. observable) governor,
then this necessitates bringing in a _abstract_ foundational government.^[Owens,\ J., _The foundations of grammar_ 55; Peled, _Sentence types_ 87--88]
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 87]{.citex}  
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}

The abstract foundational government governs both the structure-starter (the subject [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}),
and the structure-completer (the info 
[مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar})
in the u-state.

(@) [يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd stands]{.trans}

The abstract foundational government governs the structure-completer (the stateful verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar}) in the u-state.
And, as usual, the verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar} governs its doer [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} (the structure-starter) in the u-state.

<!--

#### An external element as the foundational government {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, it is possible for an element that is external to the sentence under question, to be its foundational government.
We will learn moe about this case in sections\ (ref) and (ref) below.
-->

<!--
(@) zaydun DAribun abUhu eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, if Allāh wills.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example, the smaller sentence is
DAribun abUhu eamran
"His father is beating eamr."
The doer participle DAribun governs the its doer abUhu,
and its direct doee 3amr.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an doer participle may have a doer and a direct doee.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the u-state because it is the info of the subject zaydun.
by the conceptual governor that governs the larger sentence.

(@) inna zaydan DAribun eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, if Allāh wills.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the foundational government is the particle inna.
It governs its subject zaydun in the a-state.
And it governs its info DAribun in the u-state.
However, its info 
the smaller sentence is
DAribun eamran
"He is beating eamr."
The doer participle DAribun governs
and its direct doee 3amr,
(and also its implied doer "he").
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an doer participle may have a doer and a direct doee.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the u-state because it is the info of the foundational government inna.
-->

<!--
(@) kāna Zaydun munṭaliqan ʾabūhu
    [peled 207 citing zajjaji]{.citex}

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, if Allāh wills.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the foundational government of the outer sentence is the verb kaana.
It governs its doer zaydun in the u-state.
And it governs its info muntaliqan in the a-state.
However,
muntaliqan and its doer abUhu
also constitute a sentence by themselves.
This is the inner sentence within the outer sentence.
This inner sentence 
muntaliqan abuhu
has two structural elements: 
the doer participle muntaliq,
and its doer abUhu.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an doer participle can have a doer)
muntaliq governs abUhu.
But muntaliq itself is also governed by an foundational government (the verb kaana) that is not in this inner sentence.
-->
<!--
#### More than one element in the foundational government {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, there may be more than one element (in a chain) in the foundational government, before one reaches the first governed structural element.
For example:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the 0-state.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a deficient verb, is not an structural element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the structure-starter [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the u-state
and the structure-completer [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the a-state.
Therefore [يَكُنْ]{.ar} is part of the foundational government.
-->

## Dispensable elements

A dispensable element is any stateful element in a sentence,
after the foundational government,
that is not either of the two structural elements.
The source of government for 
a dispensable element must be,
directly or indirectly,
one of the structural elements.

We know from section\ (ref) above,
that in a nounal sentence the structural elements are the subject and the info.
And that in
a verbal sentence the structural elements are the verb and its doer.
So all other elements besides these 
(and elements that constitute the foundational government)
are dispensable elements.
Here is an (incomplete) list of some common dispensable elements:
<!--
We will discuss some of dispensable elements below:

#### The a-state governees of a verb {.unnumbered}

The most prominent dispensable elements are 
all a-state elements that a verb governs.
These include:
-->

* the attribute
* the direct doee (usually)
* the absolute doee (see chapter\ (ref))
* the adverb of time and the adverb of place (see chapter\ (ref))
* the adverb of reason (see chapter\ (ref))
* the accompanying doee (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [HAl]{.trn2} (see chapter\ (ref))
* the [tamyIz]{.trn2} (see chapter\ (ref))


By the way,
when we say _dispensable_,
we mean that an element is dispensable in the sense that it is not required to complete the sentence _structurally_.
We don't mean that it is superfluous in terms of its meaning.
In fact, a dispensable element may be essential for the correct meaning of the sentence.
For example, consider the [Ayah]{.trn2}:

(@) [وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا ٱلسَّمَاۤءَ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَمَا بَیۡنَهُمَا لَـٰعِبِینَ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأنبياء]{.ar} 21:16](https://quran.com/21/16) cited by [[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/14](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/13)]{.citex}  
    [And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.]{.trans}

[لَاعِبِينَ]{.ar} is a [HAl]{.trn2} (see in chapter\ (ref)),
which is a dispensable element.
If we remove it from the sentence,
then the sentence will be structurally complete but it will have an incorrect meaning.

<!--
The direct doee is usually a dispensable element.
In most sentences, if we remove the direct doee the sentence remains structurally complete.
For example:

However, if a verb is deficient
(for example [كَانَ]{.ar}),
then its direct doee is renamed to be the info

We saw an example of this in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.
-->
<!--
#### The base noun in an annexation {.unnumbered}

Technically,
the base noun in an annexation is considered a dispensable unit.
Consider the following example:

(@) abU zaydin axU eamrin

If we remove the base noun nouns from the sentence we get:

(@) al-abu al-axu

This is a complete sentence.
al-abu is the subject.
And al-axu is the info (the structure-completer).

However, for convenience, we will often (loosely) treat
the annexation as one unit.
So we may say that the subject is
abu zaydin
and that the structure-completer is axu 3amr.

#### The followers {.unnumbered}

The followers are considered dispensable elements.
These include:

* The attribute (see chapter\ (ref))
* The substitute (see chapter\ (ref))
* The emphatic follower (see chapter\ (ref))
* The clarifying follower (see chapter\ (ref))
-->

## Refining the definitions of the nounal sentence and the verbal sentence

We know that there are two basic types of Arabic sentences:

 i. The nounal sentence
ii. The verbal sentence

Previously we had said that a nounal sentence is one that begins with a noun.
And a nounal sentence is one that begins with a verb.
We will now refine these definitions:

<!--
A _nounal sentence_ is one whose first structural element is a noun.
And
a _verbal sentence_ is one whose first structural element is a verb.
-->
A _nounal sentence_ is one whose structural elements are two nouns: a subject (as the structure-starter) and an info (as the structure-completer).
And
a _verbal sentence_ is one whose structural elements are a verb (as the structure-starter) and and its doer (as the structure-completer).

Consider, for example, the following sentence:

(@) [بَلْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Rather Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence above is [بَلْ]{.ar}.
It is a particle and not a structural element.
Removing it from the sentence, we see that the remaining structural elements are two nouns:
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} (the subject) and [قَائِمٌ]{.ar} (as the info).
So the sentence is a nounal sentence.

Let's take a look at another example:

(@) [زَيْدًا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 28]{.citex}  
    [[It was] Zayd I saw.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence is [زَيْدًا]{.ar}.
It is a direct doee.
We learned in section\ (ref) above that a direct doee is not usually a structural element.
Rather,
it is usually a dispensable elements
Stripping the sentence of this dispensable element, we are left with
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} [I saw]{.trans}.
This is a verbal sentence.
The verb [رَأى]{.ar} is the structure-completer and its doer, the pronoun [تُ]{.ar}, is the structure-starter.

<!--

## The hybrid sentence

Some sentences do not fall neatly into the categories of a nounal sentence or a verbal sentence.
We will refer to such sentences as hybrid sentences.

One example of a hybrid sentence is one that has the verb [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Example:

(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 171]{.citex}  
    [Zayd was standing]{.trans}

On the surface, 
example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above
looks like a verbal sentence because it begins with
[كَانَ]{.ar}, which is a verb.
Its doer
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the structure-starter, as usual.
But
[كَانَ]{.ar}, as used above,
is a deficient verb
(see chapter\ (ref).)
This means that it does not have sufficient meaning to structurally complete the sentence by itself.
So it cannot be a structural structure-completer.
Instead,
[كَانَ]{.ar}
requires a info 
([قَائِمًا]{.ar} above)
to be the structure-completer.

In such a sentence,
[كَانَ]{.ar}
can be considered to be the foundational government, and the sentence may be considered a nounal sentence.

Similarly consider the sentence:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the 0-state.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a deficient verb, is not an structural element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the structure-starter [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the u-state
and the structure-completer [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the a-state.
Therefore both [لَمْ]{.ar} and [يَكُنْ]{.ar} form the foundational government.

[كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).
-->
<!--
Similarly, consider the sentence:

(@) [ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 171]{.citex}  
    [I believed him [to be] standing.]{.trans}

The sentence above begins with the verb [ظَنَّ]{.ar},
which would normally make this a verbal sentence.
But the sentence with just the verb and its doer 
[ظَنَنْتُ]{.ar}
[I believed]{.trans}
seems incomplete.

[ظَنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).

## Identifying the structural elements

### Identifying the structural elements in a verbal sentence

Identifying the structural elements in a verbal sentence is relatively straightforward.
The structure-starter is always the doer of the verb.
And 
except in the case of a deficient verb,
the structure-completer is usually the verb.
We saw an example of the structural elements of a verbal sentence in example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above.

In the case of a deficient verb,
like [كَانَ]{.ar},
the verb does not complete the sentence grammatically.
So the direct doee of the verb becomes the structure-completer.
We saw an example of the structural elements of a verbal sentence with a deficient verb in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.
-->

## Identifying the structural elements in a nounal sentence

It can sometimes be complicated to tell
which of the twp structural elements in a nounal sentence is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer.
We will discuss several cases below:

### When there is an overt foundational government

When there is an overt foundational government,
like [إِنَّ]{.ar},
[كَانَ]{.ar}, etc.,
then it is usually easy to tell which is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer.
For example:

(@3amal_fainna_hasbaka_allahu) [فَإِنَّ حَسۡبَكَ ٱللَّهُ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأنفال]{.ar} 8:62](https://quran.com/8/62)]{.citex}  
    [then sufficient for you is Allāh]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_fainna_hasbaka_allahu) above,
[حَسْب]{.ar} is in the a-state as the subject and 
the word [ٱللَّهُ]{.ar} is in the u-state as the info.
This tells us that
[حَسْب]{.ar} is the structure-starter and the word
[ٱللَّهُ]{.ar} is the structure-completer.


### One structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite

When 
one structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite,
then it is usually the case that the definite element is the structure-starter (as the subject)
and the indefinite element is the structure-completer (as the info).

In terms of pragmatics, the structure-starter and the structure-completer represent 'given' and 'new' information.
That is, the listener knows who the structure-starter is and can identify him or it. So the structure-starter is a 'given' to the listener.
And the speaker is providing 'new' information about the structure-starter to the listener.
The definite element represents the 'given' information, which the listener already knows.
And the indefinite element represents 'new' information.

Let's take a look at an example:

(@3amal_tamimiyyun_ana) [تَمِيمِيٌّ أَنَا]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 121]{.citex}  
    [A [#tamIm]{.trn2}ite I am.]{.trans}

The pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} is definite. Therefore it is the structure-starter (as the subject).
And the word
[تَمِيمِيٌّ]{.ar}
is indefinite.
Therefore it is the structure-completer (as the info).
Example (@3amal_tamimiyyun_ana) is an inverted order sentence where the info is fronted and the subject is placed after it.

In special cases, some grammarians hold that it is possible to have an indefinite subject and a definite info.^[<https://alababmisr.com/%D8%B3%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE/>]
One special case is when a question noun is the subject.
(Question nouns are considered indefinite.)
For example:

(@) [كَمْ مَالُكَ]{.ar}
    [[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/231]{.citex}  
    [How much is your wealth?]{.trans}

(@) [أَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ]{.ar}
    [[[جامع الترمذي]{.ar} :3513](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3513)]{.citex}  
    [Which night is the night of Decree]{.trans}

Another special case is when the subject is an indefinite comparative noun in sentences like:

(@) [خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/231]{.citex}  
    [Better than you is Zayd]{.trans}

In the above sentence, [خَيْرٌ]{.ar} is considered the subject of the sentence.
<!--
Typically, an indefinite comparative noun would be a info instead of a subject.
For example: zaydun xayrun minka.
But imagine a scenario where someone says:
3amrun xayrun minni.
In response to this, another person may reply
xayrun minka zaydun.
The given information is xayrun minka.
And the new information is zayd.
-->
<!--
Besides these two special cases,
there are words like
[حَسْب]{.ar},
[مِثْل]{.ar},
[نَحْو]{.ar}, etc.
We will see in chapter\ (ref) that these words (exceptionally) remain indefinite when annexed to a definite noun.
So, for example, these words (as annexe nouns to definite base nouns) may be used as attributes to an indefinite noun.
For example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسْبِكَ ِمْن َرُجٍل]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/139]{.citex}

There is some debate amongst the grammarians with regards to whether these indefinite noun may occur as a subject to a definite info.^[[حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك]{.ar} 1/277]
So if we have a sentence: 

(@) [حسبُك زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Sufficient for you is Zayd.]{.trans}

then one may deem zayd as the subject because it is more definite than hasbuka.

But see also the [tafsIr]{.trn2}s of the following [Ayah]{.trn2}s:

(@) faHasbuhu jahannamu

(@) Hasbuhum jahannamu yaSlawnahA
-->

### Both structural elements are definite

When both structural elements are definite, then typically the first is the subject and the second is the info.
For example:

(@) [الدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ]{.ar}
    [[[صحيح مسلم]{.ar} :55a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:55a)]{.citex}  
    [The Religion is sincerity.]{.trans}

However, if it is known from context that one if the two elements is the 'given' information and the other is the 'new' information,
then the given information will be the subject and the new information will be the info, regardless of word-order.^[[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/233](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/232); [[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/168](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/167)]

For example, consider a situation where one wishes to say, 
"[#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is [like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}."
([#imAm #abU #yUsuf]{.trn2}
was the foremost student of
[#imAm #abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}.)
The normal way to express this sentence is:

(@3amal_abu_hanifah_abu_yusuf) [أَبُو يُوسُفَ أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar}
    [[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/233](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/232)]{.citex}  
    [[#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is [like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

However, if it is pragmatically known that the topic of the sentence is 
[أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar},
then it is 'given' that
[أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar}
is the structure-starter (as the subject).
Similarly, it is known that likening him to
[أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar}
is the 'new' information.
Therefore,
[أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ]{.ar} is the structure-completer (as the info).
In this case, the sentence order can be flexible, and the info can be fronted (stylistically), for the same meaning, thus:

(@) [أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ أَبُو يُوسُفَ]{.ar}  
    [[Like] [#abU #HanIfah]{.trn2}, [#abU #yUsuf]{.trn2} is.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

### Both structural elements are indefinite

When both structural elements are indefinite then,
again,
the first is likely to be the subject
and the second to be the info.
Examples:

(@) [أَفْضَلُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [[[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/232](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/231#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[The person] better than Zayd is better than [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [وَجَزَ ٰ⁠ۤؤُا۟ سَیِّئَةࣲ سَیِّئَةࣱ مِّثۡلُهَاۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الشورى]{.ar} 42:40](https://quran.com/42/40)]{.citex}  
    [And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it]{.trans}

## The info as a complete sentence

In a nounal sentence,
the info is, by default, a single noun.
See example (@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) again:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun),
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is a single word and it is the info.
This is what we may call a _simple_ nounal sentence.

In contrast,
in a _compound_ nounal sentence,
the info is itself a complete sentence.
For example:

(@3amal_zaydun_yaqoomu) [زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- he stands]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_yaqoomu) above,
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the subject and
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is the info.
But 
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is not a single word here.
It is in fact a complete sentence.
This is because, as we know, a verb _must_ be followed by its doer.
And if there is no overt doer, then a latent doer pronoun is implicated.
So [يَقُومُ]{.ar} is a a verbal sentence with the meaning
[he stands]{.trans}.

Here is example of a compound nounal sentence, whose info is also a nounal sentence:

(@3amal_zaydun_aboohu_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/26](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/1040)]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father is standing.]{.trans}

(FIXME: MOVE THIS TO KAANA CHAPTER):

Compound sentences are very common with [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Remember from section\ (ref) above that
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is a deficient verb, and thus needs a info to grammatically the sentence.
This info may be a single word, like:

(@) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was standing.]{.trans}

Or the info of [كَانَ]{.ar} may be a complete sentence:

(@) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd used to stand.]{.trans}

(END FIXME)

The info of a compound nounal sentence is typically a truth-evaluable sentence.
But it need not be so.
A non-truth-evaluable sentence is also valid as a info^[[شرح جمل الزجاجي لابن عصفور]{.ar} 1/347; [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/27]
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar}
    [[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/27]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- hit him!]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [Hit Zayd!]{.trans})

### The government of the compound nounal sentence sentence

The info of a compound nounal sentence is a complete sentence.
Therefore, it has its own independent internal government for all elements within it
(including its own foundational government).
But the _entire_ info is governed, albeit not markedly,  by a governor in the outer sentence.
For example, consider the following compound nounal sentence:

(@3amal_zaydun_lam_yadrib_3amran) [زَيْدٌ لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- he did not hit [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_zaydun_lam_yadrib_3amran) above,
[لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is a complete sentence that is the info of the outer sentence.
This inner sentence has its own internal government,
starting with its foundational government [لَمْ]{.ar}.
The foundational government [لَمْ]{.ar}
governs the verb [يَضْرِبْ]{.ar} in the 0-state.
And the verb [يَضْرِبْ]{.ar}
governs an implicated latent doer pronoun ([هُوَ]{.ar}) in the u-state,
and the direct doee [عَمْرًا]{.ar} in the a-state.

We will say that the inner sentence 
[لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is _in place_ of a u-state noun as the info of the outer sentence.

The government of this compound sentence is illustrated in the diagram below:

DIAGRAM

<!--
The governments of the other examples of compound sentences that we gave above, is ilustrated in the diagrams below:
-->

### Invalid inner sentences

Some sentences are not valid as inner sentences:

* A sentence beginning with [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}, [حَتَّى]{.ar}, or [بَلْ]{.ar} is not valid.^[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]
* A vocative sentence is not valid.^[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]
  So. we cannot say, for example:

  (@) ✗ [زيد يا أخاه]{.ar}
      [[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 4/28]{.citex}  
      "Zayd -- O his brother."

### The link between the inner and outer sentence

It is usually necessary for there to be a link between the inner sentence, and the subject of the outer sentence.
This link is typically supplied by a pronoun.
Let's look at some examples:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaama_aboohu) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}
    [[المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father stood up.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaama_aboohu) above, the link is the pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in abuuhu.

(@3amal_zaydun_qaama) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ]{.ar}
    [[المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- he stood up.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@3amal_zaydun_qaama) above, the link is the implied singular masculine pronoun that is the doer of [قَامَ]{.ar}.

Generally, if there is no such link between the inner sentence and the subject of the outer sentence,
then the compound sentence is invalid.^[Peled, _Sentence types_ 94 citing [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]{.ar}; [المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar}]{.citex}
So we cannot say, for example:

(@) ✗ [زَيْدٌ قَامَ عَمْرٌ]{.ar}
    [Peled, _Sentence types_ 94 citing [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]{.ar}]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- [#eamr]{.trn2} stood up]{.trans}

#### A pointing noun as the link {.unnumbered}

Instead of a pronoun,
an pointing noun may serve as the link.
For example:

(@) [وَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ خَیۡرࣱۚ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الأعراف]{.ar} 7:26](https://quran.com/7/26) cited by [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [But the clothing of righteousness - that is best.]{.trans}

#### A repeated subject as the link {.unnumbered}

The subject of the outer sentence may be repeated in the inner sentence, and this is sufficient as the link.
For example:

(@) [ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝١ مَا ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝٢]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الحاقة]{.ar} 69:1-2](https://quran.com/69/1-2) cited by [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [The Inevitable Reality - What is the Inevitable Reality?]{.trans}


#### No need for the link {.unnumbered}

In cases where the info of the outer sentence is more general than its subject a link is not needed.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- an excellent man]{.trans}

The link is also not needed when the subject of the outer sentence and its info are perfectly identical in meaning.
For example:

(@) [نُطْقِي اللَّهُ حَسْبِي]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [My utterance is "[#allAh]{.trn2} is sufficient for me."]{.trans}

(@) [قَوْلِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256D, [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية]{.ar} 1/204]{.citex}  
    [My saying is "There is no god but [#allAh]{.trn2}."]{.trans}

#### An implied link {.unnumbered}

The link, even when technically required, is sometimes omitted.
But it remains implied.
This is in cases in which the sense is perfectly clear without it.^[Wright 2/256B]
For example:

(@) [ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/256C; [المقتصد للجرجاني]{.ar} 1/278; [شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 1/238]{.citex}  
    [The ghee is (at the rate of) two [manA]{.trn2}s for a dirham.]{.trans}  

In the example above,
the sentence with the link restored is 
[ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ **مِنْهُ** بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar} 
[two [manA]{.trn2}s **of it** for a dirham.]{.trans}



## Other complete sentences in place of nouns

It is not only the info which can be replaced with a complete sentence.
Other grammatical categories are also, by default, a single noun, but which can be replaced with complete sentences.
We will discuss some of these categories below,
and treat other categories in their respective chapters
(like the [HAl]{.trn2}, the condition-response, and verbs of perception).

<!--
### The deputy doer as a complete sentence
-->

### The direct doee as a complete sentence

A sentence which is direct speech occurs in the place of a direct doee.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة مريم]{.ar} 19:30](https://quran.com/19/30) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/23](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/32#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh.]{.trans}

In the example above, the sentence 
[إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ]{.ar}
is in place of the a-state direct doee of [قَالَ]{.ar}.

A complete sentence can also occur as a direct doee with verbs of perception.
Examples:

(@) [ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا يَقْرَأُ]{.ar}
    [[[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/24](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/33#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I believed Zayd [to be] reading.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the verbal sentence
[يَقْرَأُ]{.ar}
is in place of the a-state direct doee of [ظَنَنْتُ]{.ar}.
We will learn more about this category in chapter\ (ref), if Allāh wills.

### The attribute as a complete sentence

The attribute is,
in principle,
a single noun.

However, an sentence entire sentence may occur in place of the single noun.
For example, instead of saying
[مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ قَائِمٍ]{.ar},
we can replace
the single word attribute
[قَائِمٍ]{.ar}
with the sentence
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَقُومُ]{.ar}
    [[الإيضاح للفارسي]{.ar} 308]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man [that] stands.]{.trans}  
    (literally: [I passed by a 'he stands' man.]{.trans}

Note that the stateful verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is in the u-state.
This is because
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is a complete sentence (with an implied doer pronoun).
So it has its own internal government that is not affected by any element in the outer sentence.
Thus, the state of the attributee
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar} has no effect on any state within the sentence-attribute.
However, the entire sentence attribute is _in place_ of a i-state noun as the attribute of 
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar}.

Substituing a single-noun attribute with its corresponding stateful verb is the most basic form of the sentence-attribute.
However, more complex sentence-attributes may also be formed.
For example:

(@3amal_quran_2_281) [وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة البقرة]{.ar} 2:281](https://quran.com/2/281) cited by [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/276]{.citex}  
    [And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allāh.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_quran_2_281) above,
the sentence
[تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ]{.quran}
is a attribute of [يَوْمًا]{.ar}.

<!--
Also note that when we translate such sentences into English, we need to use a _relative pronoun_ like
_that_, _which_, _who_, etc.
But in Arabic no such relative pronoun is needed or used.
Arabic does have the equivalent of the relative pronoun, called the _connected noun_,
but it has its own use cases.
We will discuss the connected noun in chapter\ (ref), if Allāh wills.
-->

There are three conditions that must be met in order for a sentence to occur as a attribute^:
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/275--278]{.citex}  

1. The attributee must be indefinite, either in wording or in meaning.
2. The sentence-attribute must contain a link that links back to the attributee.
2. The sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable.

Let's discuss each of these conditions.

#### Indefiniteness of the attributee {.unnumbered}

We already saw an example of an indefinite (in wording) attributee in example (@3amal_quran_2_281) above.
Here is an example of a attributee which is definite in wording, but indefinite in meaning:

(@3amal_walaqad_amurru) [وَلَقَدْ أَمُرُّ عَلَى اللَّئِيمِ يَسُبُّنِي]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/276]{.citex}  
    [And indeed I pass by the ignoble [person that] insults me]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_walaqad_amurru)
the attributee [اللَّئِيمِ]{.ar} is referring to a general person, and is therefore indefinite in meaning.

#### A link that links back to the attributee {.unnumbered}

In example (@3amal_quran_2_281), the link,
which links back to the attributee [يَوْمًا]{.ar},
is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in [فِيهِ]{.ar}.

Sometimes the link is not explicit, but is implied.
For example:

(@) [وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا لَّا تَجۡزِی نَفۡسٌ عَن نَّفۡسࣲ شَیۡـࣰٔا]{.quran}
    [[[سورة البقرة]{.ar} 2:123](https://quran.com/2/123) cited by [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/277]{.citex}  
    [And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all]{.trans}

The implied link
is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in an implied [فِيهِ]{.ar},
i.e. [لَا تَجْزِی **فِيهِ**]{.ar}.

#### The sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable {.unnumbered}

The following sentence is impermissible because the attribute [اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar} is a non-truth-evaluable sentence.

(@) ✗ [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ اضْرِبْهُ]{.ar}
    [[أوضح المسالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 3/278]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man -- hit him]{.trans}
    
### The base noun in an annexation as a complete sentence

The base noun in an annexation may be a complete sentence instead of a single noun.
For example:

(@3amal_yawmu_yanfa3) [هَـٰذَا یَوۡمُ یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّـٰدِقِینَ صِدۡقُهُمۡۚ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة المائدة]{.ar} 5:119](https://quran.com/5/119) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/28](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/37)]{.citex}  
    [This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_yawmu_yanfa3) above the entire sentence
[یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّادِقِینَ صِدْقُهُمْ]{.ar}
is the base noun to the annexe noun [يَوْمُ]{.ar}.
As with sentence-infos and sentence-attributes,
the sentence-base noun has its own internal government.
And the sentence-base noun is _in place_ of an i-state noun.

Here is another example:

(@) [یَوۡمَ هُم بَـٰرِزُونَۖ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة غافر]{.ar} 40:16](https://quran.com/40/16) cited by [[شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب]{.ar} 1/29](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/38#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Day they come forth]{.trans}

## A foreign element separating a governor from its governee

A foreign element is one that is not _directly_ governed by a governor.
In most cases,
a foreign element should not come between (and thus separate) a governor from its governee(s).
For example, consider the following sentence:

(@) [عَلِمْتُ مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا]{.ar}
    [[الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 66]{.citex}  
    [I knew [#muHammad]{.trn2} [to be] writing a book.]{.trans}

In the example above the verbal sentence
[يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is in place of the second direct doee of
[عَلِمْتُ]{.ar}.
The noun
[كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is governed directly by the verb
[يُؤَلِّفُ]{.ar}.
So 
[كِتَابًا]{.ar}
is a foreign element for the verb
[عَلِمْتُ]{.ar}.
Therefore, the following sentence is impermissible:

(@) ✗ [عَلِمْتُ كِتَابًا مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ]{.ar}
    [[الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي]{.ar} 66]{.citex}  


## The state-of-affairs pronoun

Usually, for pronouns, the pronoun's referent is a single noun that occurs before it.
For example,
if we say 

(@) [زَيْدٌ هَوَ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}

Then the pronoun
[هُوَ]{.ar}
refers to the noun [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} which occurs before it.

There is a special pronoun, called the _state-of-affairs pronoun_
([ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ]{.ar})
that behaves differently from other pronouns
It is used to begin compound nounal sentences.
Here is an example of a sentence with a state-of-affairs pronoun:

(@) [هُوَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/57](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/56)]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}  

The pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} is the state-of-affairs pronoun
It is the subject of the outer sentence.
Its info is the inner sentence
[زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}.
What the state-of-affairs pronoun is referring to
is explained by the entire sentence
[زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
that occurs after it.

The state-of-affairs pronoun is typically used for statements that are momentous.
Consider, for example, a situation where one hears some hubbub, and wonders,
"What is the state of affairs that is causing this hubbub?"
The answer to this question is:

(@3amal_huwa_alameeru_muqbilun) [هُوَ الأَمِيرُ مُقْبِلٌ]{.ar}
    [[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/464]{.citex}  
    [It is: the commander is approaching.]{.trans}  
    (the pronoun "it" is referring to "the state of affairs".)

This pronoun is often left untranslated.
So example (@3amal_huwa_alameeru_muqbilun) may simply be translated as
[The commander is approaching.]{.trans}

Here are some rules and guidelines regarding the state-of-affairs pronoun:

#### The gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun {.unnumbered}

If the subject of the following sentence is masculine,
then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the masculine pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar}.
And
if the subject of the following sentence is feminine,
then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the feminine pronoun [هِيَ]{.ar}.
Examples:

(@) [**هُوَ** زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هِيَ** هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.]{.trans}

As mentioned,
the gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun generally matches the gender of the following subject (as above).
Sometimes, however, it is found to mismatch. For example:

(@) [**هِيَ** زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هُوَ** هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ]{.ar}
    [[البسيط لابن أبي الربيع]{.ar} 745--756]{.citex}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.]{.trans}

#### The state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun {.unnumbered}

The state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun, regardless of whether the subject of the following subject is singular, dual, or plural.^[[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]

(@) [**هُوَ** الزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ]{.ar}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: the two Zayds are standing.]{.trans}

(@) [**هِيَ** الْهِنْدَاتُ قَائِمَاتٌ]{.ar}  
    [[The state of affairs] is: the Hinds are standing.]{.trans}

#### The state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun for the absentee person {.unnumbered}

Even if the subject of the inner sentence is a pronoun for the speaker or adressee persons,
the state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun of for the absentee person.
For example:

(@) [هُوَ أَنَا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[The fact] is: I am Zayd.]{.trans}  

The sentence 
[أَنَا أَنَا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is possible, but in this case the pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} is not a state-of-affairs pronoun.
Rather it is repeated for emphasis.^[[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 1/59](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/58#p1)]

#### The state-of-affairs pronouns [هُوَ]{.ar} and [هِيَ]{.ar} only introduce nounal sentences {.unnumbered}

The state-of-affairs pronouns [هُوَ]{.ar} and [هِيَ]{.ar} only introduce nounal sentences.^[[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/467]
This can be seen in the examples above.

We will see, in sections\ (kaana) and (inna),
that the state-of-affairs pronoun can also be used with
[كَانَ]{.ar} and [إِنَّ]{.ar} (and its sisters).
In these cases, the state-of-affairs pronoun may introduce verbal sentences.
For example:

(@) [فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعۡمَى ٱلۡأَبۡصَـٰرُ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة الحج]{.ar} 22:46](https://quran.com/22/46) cited by [شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} 2/467]{.citex}  
    [For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded]{.trans}
