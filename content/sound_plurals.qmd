# Sound plurals

## Introduction

Arabic uses the plural for nouns in number three and higher. The formation and use of plurals in Arabic can be somewhat complicated. One of these complications is that, in using plurals, Arabic distinguishes between intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings. Intelligent beings are those living beings that are endowed with reason like humans, angels, and jinn. Non-intelligent beings include animals, inanimate objects, abstract concepts, etc.

As a further complication, there is sometimes more than one way to use plurals. In this chapter we will explain the most common usages to keep things as simple as possible.

Arabic has two categories of plurals:

1. The _sound plural:_ 
   English regularly forms the plural by adding the plural ending "s" to the end of a singular noun. For example:
   
   | Singular | Plural |
   |:-----------|:-----------|
   | book       | books      |
   | house      | houses     |
   | boy        | boys       |
   | girl       | girls      |
   
   Arabic also forms some plurals by adding plural endings to to the singular noun. This kind of plural is call a _sound_ plural because the singular noun is kept more or less sound (intact) when adding the plural ending.
   
   Arabic has two types of sound plurals:
   
   i.  The [Un]{.trn} sound plural.
   ii. The [At]{.trn} sound plural.

  We will describe each of these in this chapter.

2. The _broken plural_: When forming this plural the singular noun is not kept intact. We will learn about this plural in the next chapter, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.

<!--When translating plurals to English, we may use the subscript "3+" thus "teachers~m,3+~" in order to distinguish it from the dual "teachers~m,2~".-->

## The [Un]{.trn} sound plural

The [Un]{.trn} sound plural is formed by adding the ending [◌ُونَ]{.ar} [-Una]{.trn} to the singular noun when it is in the [ustate]{.subs}, and [◌ِينَ]{.ar} [-Ina]{.trn} when the noun is in the [astate]{.subs} or [istate]{.subs}. For convenience, we will call it the "[Un]{.trn} sound plural" instead of the "[-Una]{.trn}/[-Ina]{.trn} plural".

Here is the [Un]{.trn} sound plural of [مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn} "a teacher~m~":

| State | Indefinite [Un]{.trn} plural "teachers~m~"| Definite [Un]{.trn} plural "the teachers~m~"|
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [ustate]{.subs}         | [مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [mueallimUna]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimUna]{.trn}|
| [astate]{.subs} and [istate]{.subs} | [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [mueallimIna]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimIna]{.trn}|

Note that, just like for duals, the indefinite [Un]{.trn} sound plural is not [tanwin]{.subs}ed. The only difference between the definite and indefinite [Un]{.trn} sound plural is the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} "the". 

The duals of [مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn} "a teacher~m~" are included here for comparison:

| State | Indefinite [Un]{.trn} sound plural "teachers~m,2~" | Definite [Un]{.trn} sound plural "the teachers~m,2~"|
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [ustate]{.subs}         | [مُعَلِّمَانِ]{.ar} [mueallimAni]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَانِ]{.ar} [EalmueallimAni]{.trn}|
| [astate]{.subs} and [istate]{.subs} | [مُعَلِّمَيْنِ]{.ar} [mueallimayni]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَيْنِ]{.ar} [Ealmueallimayni]{.trn}|

Here are some examples of the [Un]{.trn} sound plural in sentences:

+ [ustate]{.subs}:

  [ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
  [EalmueallimUna fi -lmadrasah]{.trn}  
  "The teachers are in the school."

+ [astate]{.subs}:

  [سَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ مُعَلِّمِينَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
  [saEala -lgulAmu mueallimIna ean Eamr.]{.trn}  
  "The boy asked some teachers about a matter."

+ [istate]{.subs}:

  [طَلَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ مِنَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمِينَ عِلْمًا.]{.ar}  
  [Talaba -lgulAmu mina -lmueallimIna eilmA.]{.trn}  
  "The boy sought some knowledge from the teachers."

### Applicability of the [Un]{.trn} sound plural {#applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural}

Except for very few exceptions, the [Un]{.trn} sound plural is used only for male intelligent beings. 

<!--We will learn some of these exceptions in chapter\ \@ref(irregular-nouns).-->

<!--Of these exceptions, the word [سَنَةٌ]{.ar} [sanatun]{.trn} "a year" is the most common. It is pluralized as [سِنُونَ]{.ar} [sinUna]{.trn} in the [ustate]{.subs} and [سِنِينَ]{.ar} [sinIna]{.trn} in the [astate]{.subs} and [istate]{.subs}.-->

The few exceptions of common nouns that denote non-male intelligent beings, yet have an [Un]{.trn} sound plural include:

+ [عَالَم]{.ar} [eAlam]{.trn} "a world" forms the [Un]{.trn} plural [عَالَمُونَ]{.ar} [EAlamUna]{.trn} "worlds".
+ [أَرْض]{.ar} [EarD]{.trn} (fem.) "a land", "an earth" forms the [Un]{.trn} plural [أَرْضُونَ]{.ar} [EarDUna]{.trn} "lands", "earths".
+ [أَهْل]{.ar} [Eahl]{.trn} "a family" forms the [Un]{.trn} plural [أَهْلُونَ]{.ar} [EahlUna]{.trn} "families".


## The [At]{.trn} sound plural

The [At]{.trn} sound plural is formed by adding the ending [ات]{.ar} [At]{.trn} to the indefinite singular noun. <!-- when it is in the [ustate]{.subs}, and [ـَاتٍ]{.ar} [Atin]{.trn} when the noun is in the [astate]{.subs} or [istate]{.subs}.-->

Here is the [At]{.trn} sound plural of [حَيَوَان]{.ar} [HayawAn]{.trn} "an animal":

| State | Indefinite [Un]{.trn} plural "animals"| Definite [Un]{.trn} plural "the animals"|
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [ustate]{.subs}         | [حَيَوَانَاتٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtun]{.trn} |[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn}|
| [astate]{.subs} and [istate]{.subs} | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtin]{.trn} |[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}|

Note that: <!-- there _are_ [tanwin]{.subs}s for the [At]{.trn} sound plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way but they won't have [tanwin]{.subs}s:-->

+ Unlike the [Un]{.trn} sound plural, the [At]{.trn} sound plural is [tanwin]{.subs}ed when indefinite. Also, just like for singular nouns, the final vowel on the plural ending [ات]{.ar} [At]{.trn} indicates the state of the plural.
+ The [At]{.trn} sound plural does not take the [amark]{.subs} [◌َ]{.ar} and the [tanwin]{.subs}ed [amark]{.subs} [◌ً]{.ar}. Instead the [imark]{.subs} [◌ِ]{.ar} and the [tanwin]{.subs}ed [imark]{.subs} [◌ٍ]{.ar} are used to indicate both the [astate]{.subs} and the [istate]{.subs}.

| State | the animal | the animals
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [ustate]{.subs} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn}|
| [astate]{.subs} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَ]{.ar} [EalHayawAna]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}|
| [istate]{.subs} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAni]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}|

### Nouns ending in [ة]{.ar}

If a noun ends with a [ة]{.ar}, then it is removed before appending the [At]{.trn} sound plural ending. 
Here, for example, is the [At]{.trn} sound plural of [مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar} [mueallimah]{.trn} "a teacher~f~":

| State | Indefinite [Un]{.trn} plural "teachers~f~"| Definite [Un]{.trn} plural "the teachers~f~"|
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [ustate]{.subs}         | [مُعَلِّمَاتٌ]{.ar} [mueallimAtun]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ]{.ar} [EalmueallimAtu]{.trn}|
| [astate]{.subs} and [istate]{.subs} | [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar} [mueallimAtin]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتِ]{.ar} [EalmueallimAti]{.trn}|

Here are some examples of the [At]{.trn} sound plural in sentences:

+ [ustate]{.subs}:

  [فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ مُعَلِّمَاتٌ .]{.ar}  
  [fi -lmadrasati mueallimAt.]{.trn}  
  "In the school are teachers."

+ [astate]{.subs}:

  [نَصَرَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ.]{.ar}  
  [naSara -llAhu -lmuslimIn.]{.trn}  
  "[_allAh]{.trn2} aided the Muslims.

+ [istate]{.subs}:

  [نَظَرَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَى ٱلْحَيَوَانَاتِ.]{.ar}  
  [naPara -lgulAmu Eila -lHayawAnAt.]{.trn}  
  "The boy looked at the animals."

There are some nouns that end with an [alif]{.trn2} before the [ة]{.ar}, like [فَتَاة]{.ar} [fatAh]{.trn} "a young woman". We will learn how to pluralize these nouns later, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.

### Nouns ending with [اء]{.ar}

Consistent with what we learned for duals in section\ \@ref(duals-of-extrinsic-alif-mamduda),
if a noun ends with the feminine marker [اء]{.ar} which is extrinsic to the word's root then the [ء]{.ar} shall be replaced with a [و]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural.
Example:

|Root|Singular| [At]{.trn} sound plural|
|:-|:-----|:--|
|[صحر]{.ar}|^2^[صَحْرَاء]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn}^2^ "a desert" |[صَحْرَاوَات]{.ar} [SaHrAwAt]{.trn} |


### Nouns ending with [ىٰ]{.ar} 

Consistent with what we learned for duals in section\ \@ref(duals-of-extrinsic-alif-maqsura),
If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar} which is extrinsic to the word's root then the [ىٰ]{.ar} shall be changed to a [يَ]{.ar} when when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural. Examples:

|Root|Singular| [At]{.trn} sound plural|
|:-|:-----|:--|
|[ذكر]{.ar}|^2^[ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn}^2^ "a remembrance" | [ذِكْرَيَات]{.ar} [pikrayAt]{.trn} |

<!--
### Nouns ending with [اء]{.ar}, [ىٰ]{.ar}, [ا]{.ar}, and [اة]{.ar} {#at-plural-for-defective-nouns}

As with duals, nouns that end with [اء]{.ar}, [ىٰ]{.ar}, [ا]{.ar}, and [اة]{.ar} are treated specially when forming their [At]{.trn} sound plural. Examples of such nouns are:

+ [سَمَاء]{.ar} [samAE]{.trn} "a sky"
+ [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} _adj._ "very angry~f~"
+ [ٱَلْعَصَا]{.ar} [EaleaSA]{.trn} "the staff"
+ [فَتَاة]{.ar} [fatAh]{.trn} "a young woman"

We will learn how to form the [At]{.trn} sound plural of these words in later chapters, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.

### The [At]{.trn} sound plural for words ending with [اء]{.ar}

If a noun ends with an [اء]{.ar} then the [hamzah]{.trn2} may either be retained or get converted to a [و]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural. This is done based on the same rules as for the dual which we explained in the previous chapter.

Thus,

+ REMOVE because plurals of qualitative nouns not yet discussed: [صَفْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SafrAE]{.trn} (root: [صفر]{.ar}) becomes [صَفْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SafrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} (root: [صحر]{.ar}) becomes [صَحْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [إِبْطًاءٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEun]{.trn} (root: [بطء]{.ar}) becomes [إِبْطَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEAtun]{.trn}.
+ [سَمَاءٌ]{.ar} [samAEun]{.trn} (root: [سمو]{.ar}) becomes [سَمَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAEAtun]{.trn} or [سَمَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAwAtun]{.trn}.

### The [At]{.trn} sound plural for words ending with [يٰ]{.ar}

If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar}, then whether the [ىٰ]{.ar} is a feminine marker or not, it becomes a [yAE]{.trn2} with an [amark]{.subs} [يَ]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural. For example,  

+ [حُبَارَىٰ]{.ar} [HubArA]{.trn} becomes [حُبَارَيَاتٌ]{.ar} [HubArayAtun]{.trn}.

### Designative nouns of the pattern [فَُِعْل]{.ar} and [فَُِعْلَة]{.ar}
-->

### Common nouns of the patterns [فَعْل]{.ar}/[فَعْلَة]{.ar}, [فِعْل]{.ar}/[فِعْلَة]{.ar}, and [فُعْل]{.ar}/[فُعْلَة]{.ar}

Common nouns of the patterns [فَعْل]{.ar}/[فَعْلَة]{.ar}, [فِعْل]{.ar}/[فِعْلَة]{.ar}, and [فُعْل]{.ar}/[فُعْلَة]{.ar} are treated specially when forming their [At]{.trn} sound plural.

If a common noun is of these patterns and the middle root letter is not [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, and the middle and final root letters are not the same, then the word is modified internally when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural.

There are two separate rules to consider:

1.  If a common noun is of the pattern [فَعْل]{.ar} [fael]{.trn} or [فَعْلَة]{.ar} [faelah]{.trn}, then the [0mark]{.subs} on the middle letter shall be converted to an [amark]{.subs} [◌َ]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural. For example:

    + [نَحْلَة]{.ar} [naHlah]{.trn} "a bee" becomes [نَحَلَات]{.ar} [naHalAt]{.trn} "bees", not $\times$\ [نَحْلَات]{.ar} [naHlAt]{.trn}.
    + [ضَرْبَة]{.ar} [Darbah]{.trn} "a strike" becomes [ضَرَبَات]{.ar} [DarabAt]{.trn} "strikes", not $\times$\ [ضَرْبَات]{.ar} [DarbAt]{.trn}.
    + [صَفْحَة]{.ar} [SafHah]{.trn} "a page" becomes [صَفَحَات]{.ar} [SafaHAt]{.trn} "pages", not $\times$\ [صَفْحَات]{.ar} [SafHAt]{.trn}.

    If the middle root letter is [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, or the middle and final root letters are the same then this modification is not done. For example,

    + [جَوْزَة]{.ar} [jawzah]{.trn} "a walnut" becomes [جَوْزَات]{.ar} [jawzAt]{.trn}.
    + [حَجَّة]{.ar} [Hajjah]{.trn} "a pilgrimage" becomes [حَجَّات]{.ar} [HajjAt]{.trn}.

2.  If a common noun is of the pattern [فِعْل]{.ar} [fiel]{.trn}, [فِعْلَة]{.ar} [fielah]{.trn}, [فُعْل]{.ar} [fuel]{.trn}, or [فُعْلَة]{.ar} [fuelah]{.trn} then the [0mark]{.subs} on the middle letter can, optionally, either:

    i.   be retained,
    ii.  be converted to an [amark]{.subs}, or
    iii. be converted to the vowel mark on the first letter.

    For example:

    + [ظُلْمَة]{.ar} [Pulmah]{.trn} "a darkness" can become, optionally, either [ظُلْمَات]{.ar} [PulmAt]{.trn} or [ظُلَمَات]{.ar} [PulamAt]{.trn}, or [ظُلُمَات]{.ar} [PulumAt]{.trn} "darknesses".
    + [كِسْرَة]{.ar} [kisrah]{.trn} "a piece" can become, optionally, either [كِسْرَات]{.ar} [kisrAt]{.trn} or [كِسَرَات]{.ar} [kisarAt]{.trn}, or [كِسِرَات]{.ar} [kisirAt]{.trn} "pieces".

Note that this rule of changing the vowel mark is only true for common nouns. [_sifah]{.subs}s on these patterns will retain the [0mark]{.subs} when forming the [At]{.trn} sound plural. So [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn} and [صَعْبَة]{.ar} [Saebah]{.trn} "a difficult one" become only [صَعْبَات]{.ar} [SaebAt]{.trn}, not $\times$\ [صَعَبَات]{.ar} [SaeabAt]{.trn}.

### Applicability of the [At]{.trn} sound plural

We had mentioned that the [Un]{.trn} sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for male intelligent beings. Conversely, the [At]{.trn} is used for both female intelligent beings, and for non-intelligent beings (both masculine and feminine) like animals, inanimate objects, and abstract concepts. Rarely, it is also used for male intelligent beings.


<!--
Examples:

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimAtu fi -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"The female teachers are in the school."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ فِي ٱلْغَابَاتِ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnAtu fi -lgAbAti.]{.trn}  
"The animals are in the forests."
-->

## Conditions for forming the sound plural

Many times, a noun can form both an [Un]{.trn} sound plural and an [At]{.trn} sound plural.
<!--However, some nouns form only an [Un]{.trn} sound plural, and not an [At]{.trn} sound plural.
Conversely, some nouns form only an [At]{.trn} sound plural, and not an [Un]{.trn} sound plural.
-->
However, there are many nouns that can form only one of the two sound plurals.
And many nouns don't form either sound plural; they only form broken plurals. (We will learn about broken plurals in the next chapter, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.) There are even nouns that can form both sound and broken plurals.

Here we will learn some of the conditions which a noun needs to satisfy in order for it to form the sound plurals.

### Conditions for the [Un]{.trn} sound plural

The [Un]{.trn} sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for nouns that denote male intelligent beings. These guidelines will help you determine which nouns form the [Un]{.trn} sound plural. 

We will treat common nouns and [sifah]{.subs}s separately.

#### Common nouns

<!--Common nouns will form an [Un]{.trn} sound plural if it is listed in their vocabulary/dictionary definition. 
You can often determine if a common noun will regularly form a sound plural based on the pattern of the noun. But that is an advanced technique that we will learn later, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills. For now, we will rely on the dictionary/vocabulary definition to tell us whether a noun forms the [Un]{.trn} sound plural.
-->
With very few exceptions (some of which we saw in 
section\ \@ref(applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural)),
common nouns denoting male intelligent beings are disqualified from forming the [Un]{.trn} sound plural if their feminine counterpart is not formed by adding a [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun. 
<!--the only common nouns that _may_ be allowed to form [Un]{.trn} sound plurals are those that denote male intelligent beings, and whose feminine is formed by adding a [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun. -->
So, [غُلَام]{.ar} [gulAm]{.trn} "a boy" is disqualified from forming a [Un]{.trn} sound plural because its feminine counterpart is [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} "a girl", not $\times$\ [غُلَامَة]{.ar} [gulAmah]{.trn}. 

Even if a common noun denotes a male intelligent being and its female counterpart is formed by adding a [ة]{.ar}, 
further conditions are imposed that can restrict its having a [Un]{.trn} sound plural.
We will explain these restrictions below:

We learned in section\ \@ref(related-nouns-for-male-and-female-animate-beings) that, in terms of their meaning, nouns that denote animate beings are of two kinds:

i.  Nouns that have a primitive meaning. That is, their meaning is not derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun):

    Arabic word | Definition
    :----------------|:----------------
    [ٱِبْن]{.ar}    [Eibn]{.trn}      |a son
    [طِفْل]{.ar}    [Tifl]{.trn}      |a child
    [إِنْسَان]{.ar}  [EinsAn]{.trn}    |a human being
    [حُرّ]{.ar}     [Hurr]{.trn}      |a free man

    Such nouns, in general, won't be expected to form [Un]{.trn} sound plurals, unless the [Un]{.trn} sound plural is explicitly allowed in their dictionary definition.

ii. Nouns that have a meaning that is derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun):

    |Word | Definition | [Un]{.trn} plural|
    |:--------------|:----------------|:------------|
    |[مُعَلِّم]{.ar}  |a  teacher~m~   |[مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar}|
    |[مُسْلِم]{.ar}  |a  Muslim~m~ (one who submits)  |[مُسْلِمُونَ]{.ar}|
    |[كَافِر]{.ar}  |a  disbeliever~m~ |[كَافِرُونَ]{.ar}|
    |[لَاعِب]{.ar}  |a  player~m~    |[لَاعِبُونَ]{.ar}|

    Such nouns, in general, can be expected to form [Un]{.trn} sound plurals. 
    
<!--Many of these nouns also, as we will see in the next chapter, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills, form broken plurals. In general, then, the broken plural is preferred to be used over the sound plural, and the sound plural is only used in specific cases (that we will also see later, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills).-->

The above defintion of primitve and derived nouns, as we have explained it, is somewhat imprecise. For example, the word 
    [حُرّ]{.ar}     [Hurr]{.trn}      (masc.) "a free man" seems to have a meaning that is derived from the adjective "free" and it forms its feminine by adding [ة]{.ar} to it thus: 
[حُرَّة]{.ar}    [Hurrah]{.trn}    (fem.) "a free woman".
Yet it is considered a primitve noun, and thus does not form an [Un]{.trn} sound plural.

<!--
In later chapters, once we have studied the patterns of the derived nouns, we will try to make this condition more precise, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.
-->
Once you become more familiar with Arabic word patterns, distinguishing between primitive and derived nouns will become clearer, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.

#### [_sifah]{.subs}s

If an [sifah]{.subs} forms its feminine by adding the feminine marker [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun, then we may assume that it forms the [Un]{.trn} sound plural. 

Most [sifah]{.subs}s satisfy this condition. For example, consider the [sifah]{.subs}:

+ [كَبِير]{.ar} [kabIr]{.trn} (masc.) "a big one"

It forms its feminine by adding a [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun, thus:

+ [كَبِيرَة]{.ar} [kabIrah]{.trn} (fem.) "a big one"

The above condition is satisfied; therefore,
[كَبِير]{.ar} [kabIr]{.trn} (masc.) "a big one" forms the [Un]{.trn} sound plural [كَبِيرُونَ]{.ar} [kabIrUna]{.trn} "big ones".

By the way, it is only the masculine [sifah]{.subs} that will form the [Un]{.trn} sound plural. Nouns with a [ة]{.ar} are not allowed to form the [Un]{.trn} sound plural.

We have come across two patterns on [sifah]{.subs}s that don't form their feminine by adding [ة]{.ar} to masculine noun. These are:

i.  ^2^[فَعْلَان]{.ar} [faelAn]{.trn}^2^, whose feminine is on the pattern ^2^[فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [faelA]{.trn}^2^. Example: ^2^[غَضْبَان]{.ar} [gaDbAn]{.trn}^2^ (masc.) "very angry" whose feminine is ^2^[غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}^2^.
ii. ^2^[أَفْعَل]{.ar} [Eafeal]{.trn}^2^, whose feminine is on the pattern ^2^[فَعْلَاء]{.ar} [faelAE]{.trn}^2^. Example: ^2^[أَحْمَر]{.ar} [EaHmar]{.trn}^2^ (masc.) "red", whose feminine is ^2^[حَمْرَاء]{.ar} [HamrAE]{.trn}^2^.

Because the above two patterns don't form their feminine by adding [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun, therefore the masculine nouns don't form the [Un]{.trn} sound plural. 
We will see in chapter @broken_plurals, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills, that they form broken plurals instead.

### Conditions for the [At]{.trn} sound plural {#conditions-for-the-at-plural}

Just like the [Un]{.trn} plural, there are conditions that should be fulfilled in order for a noun to form an [At]{.trn} plural.
We provide the following guidelines to help you determine if a noun can form an [At]{.trn} plural.

#### Nouns that end with a feminine marker

Generally, all nouns that end with a feminine marker like
[ة]{.ar}, [اء]{.ar}, and [ىٰ]{.ar}
are able to form an [At]{.trn} plural.
<!--
This includes both common nouns and [sifah]{.subs}s.

As mentioned in section\ \@ref(at-plural-for-defective-nouns) above, we will learn how to form plurals for nouns that end with 
[اء]{.ar}, and [ىٰ]{.ar}
later, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.
So, for now, we will focus on nouns that end with [ة]{.ar}.
-->
Examples are:

|Singular| [At]{.trn} sound plural|
|:-------|:--|
|[حَسَنَة]{.ar} [Hasanah]{.trn} _adj._ "a good one~f~"     |[حَسَنَات]{.ar} [HasanAt]{.trn}|
|[حَسَنَة]{.ar} [Hasanah]{.trn} (common noun) "a good deed"| [حَسَنَات]{.ar} [HasanAt]{.trn}|
|[صَدِيقَة]{.ar} [SadIqah]{.trn} "a friend~f~"             |[صَدِيقَات]{.ar} [SadIqAt]{.trn}|
|^2^[صَحْرَاء]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn}^2^ "a desert"           |[صَحْرَاوَات]{.ar} [SaHrAwAt]{.trn} |
|^2^[ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn}^2^ "a remembrance"        | [ذِكْرَيَات]{.ar} [pikrayAt]{.trn} |

The following are exceptions to this general rule, and don't form [At]{.trn} sound plurals:

+ [_sifah]{.subs}s of the pattern ^2^[فَعْلَاء]{.ar} which is the feminine of the masculine [sifah]{.subs} pattern ^2^[أَفْعَل]{.ar}. For example, [حَمْرَاء]{.ar} [HamrAE]{.trn} "red~f~".

+ [_sifah]{.subs}s of the pattern ^2^[فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} which is the feminine of the masculine [sifah]{.subs} pattern ^2^[فَعْلَان]{.ar}. For example, [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} "very angry~f~".

+ The following exceptional nouns:

  + [أُمَّة]{.ar} [Eummah]{.trn} "a nation"
  + [أَمَة]{.ar} [Eamah]{.trn} "a female slave"
  + [شَفَة]{.ar} [cafah]{.trn} "a lip"

  There are a few more such nouns, some of which we will introduce later.

All these exceptional nouns form broken plurals instead of the [At]{.trn} sound plural.

#### Nouns that don't end with a feminine marker

##### Common nouns {-}

Common nouns that don't end with a feminine marker will form the [At]{.trn} plural only if they don't have a broken plural listed in the dictionary. Furthermore, it is preferred if the noun have five or more letters.

+ [حَيَوَان]{.ar} [HayawAn]{.trn} "an animal" forms the [At]{.trn} plural [حَيَوَانَات]{.ar} [HayawAnAt]{.trn} "animals".
+ [حَمَّام]{.ar} [HammAm]{.trn} forms the [At]{.trn} plural [حَمَّامَات]{.ar} [HammAmAt]{.trn} "bathrooms". (The doubled [م]{.ar} counts as two letters.)

##### Masculine [sifah]{.subs}s {-}

Masculine [sifah]{.subs}s are permitted to form an [At]{.trn} sound plural, but only when they are applied to non-intelligent beings.

For example, if the masculine [sifah]{.subs} [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn} "a difficult one" is applied to "books", which is the plural of the masculine noun [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book", then the masculine [sifah]{.subs} [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn} is permitted to form the [At]{.trn} plural [صَعْبَات]{.ar} [SaebAt]{.trn} "difficult ones".

By the way, note that both the masculine [sifah]{.subs} [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn}, and its feminine [صَعْبَة]{.ar} [Saebah]{.trn} form the same [At]{.trn} sound plural [صَعْبَات]{.ar} [SaebAt]{.trn}.

<!--
## Usage of plural [sifah]{.subs}s

We will defer the discussion on how to use plural [sifah]{.subs}s until the next chapter, when we will learn broken plurals, if [_allAh]{.trn2} wills.
-->

<!--
## Plurals of [sifah]{.subs}s 

Most [sifah]{.subs}s form sound plurals. For now you can assume, unless told otherwise, that any [sifah]{.subs} can form an [Un]{.trn} sound plural applicable to male intelligent beings, and an [At]{.trn} sound plural applicable to female intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings.

In later chapters, we will give a more complete list of conditions that need to be satisfied for a noun to form sound plurals.

So the masculine [sifah]{.subs} [طَيِّب]{.ar} "Tayyib" (masc.) "a good one" will form the following plurals:

+ the [Un]{.trn} sound plural [طَيِّبُونَ]{.ar} [TayyibUna]{.trn} applicable to male intelligent beings, and
+ the [At]{.trn} sound plural [طَيِّبَات]{.ar} [TayyibAt]{.trn} applicable to masculine nouns non-intelligent beings.

And the feminine [sifah]{.subs} [طَيِّبَة]{.ar}

It is not just designative nouns that have plurals. Many qualitative nouns may be pluralized with sound plurals as well. For example, [طَيِّبٌ]{.ar} [Tayyibun]{.trn} has the [Un]{.trn} sound plural [طَيِّبُونَ]{.ar} [TayyibUna]{.trn} and the [At]{.trn} sound plural [طَيِّبَاتٌ]{.ar} [TayyibAtun]{.trn}. The complete rules of whether a qualitative noun has a sound plural are somwehat complicated. For now, you may use the following rule of thumb:

Only masculine qualitative nouns that form their feminine by the addition of [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [Un]{.trn} sound plural. And all feminine qualitative noun that ends with [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [At]{.trn} sound plural. But there do exist feminine qualitative nouns that don't end with [ة]{.ar} that form the [At]{.trn} sound plural. For example,

+ [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big (masc.)" forms its feminine with the addition of [ة]{.ar}: [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn}. Therefore it can be pluralized with the sound [Un]{.trn} sound plural [كَبِيرُونَ]{.ar}. And [كَبيرَةٌ]{.ar} can be pluralized as [كَبِيرَاتٌ]{.ar}.
+ [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} "very angry (masc.)" forms its feminine without [ة]{.ar}: [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}. Therefore it will not form the sound [Un]{.trn} sound plural.

In using plurals of qualitative nouns, Arabic distinguishes between intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings. Here we explain the usage of qualitative noun plurals with intelligent beings. We will explain the usage of qualitative noun plurals with non-intelligent beings in the next chapter, if Allah wills.

When a qualitative noun is describing plural intelligent beings, then the qualitative noun will be pluralized. For example,

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ طَيِّبُونَ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna TayyibUna]{.trn}  
"The male teachers are good."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَاتُ ٱلطَّوِيلَاتُ سَرِيعَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ljAriyAtu -TTawIlAtu sarIeAtin]{.trn}  
"The tall girls were fast."
-->

## Detached plural pronouns

We have already learned the detached pronouns for singular and dual nouns. They are repeated here:

|Participant|Detached pronoun|
|:---|:-|
|Absentee  sing. masc.    |[هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn}   "he"      |
|Absentee  sing. fem.     |[هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn}   "she"    |
|Absentee  dual           |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn}      "they~2~" |
|Addressee sing. masc.    |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} "you~1,m~"|
|Addressee sing. fem.     |[أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} "you~1,f~"|
|Addressee dual           |[أَنْتُمَا]{.ar} [EantumA]{.trn} "you~2~" |
|Speaker   sing.          |[أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn}  "I"      |
|Speaker   dual           | -- |

Now we will learn the detached pronouns for the plural participants:

|Participant|Detached pronoun|
|:---|:-|
|Absentee  pl. masc. |[هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}        "they~3,m~" |
|Absentee  pl. fem.  |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [hunna]{.trn}      "they~3,f~" |
|Addressee pl. masc. |[أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}   "you~3,m~" |
|Addressee pl. fem.  |[أَنْتُنَّ]{.ar} [Eantunna]{.trn} "you~3,f~" |
|Speaker   pl.       |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn}     "we" |

Note that the plural detached pronoun for the speaker participant 
[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn}     "we"
are the same for both genders.

Also, remember that there is no detached pronoun for the dual speaker-participant. 
So, if the speaker-pariticipant consists of two individuals then we will use the plural pronoun.

Here are some examples of their use:

[هُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ.]{.ar}  
[hum muslimUn.]{.trn}  
"They~3,m~ are men~3~."

[هُنَّ مُعَلِّمَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[hum mueallimaAt.]{.trn}  
"They~3,f~ are teachers~f~."

[أَنْتُمْ لَاعِبُونَ.]{.ar}  
[Eantum lAeibUn.]{.trn}  
"You~3,m~ are players~3,m~."

[أَنْتُنَّ صَدِيقَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[Eantunna SadIqAt.]{.trn}  
"You~3,f~ are friends~3,f~."

[نَحْنُ رَجُلَانِ فَقِيرَانِ.]{.ar}  
[naHnu rajulAni faqIrAn.]{.trn}  
"We~2,m~ are poor men~2~." (Note the plural pronoun [mubtada]{.subs} with a dual noun in the [xabar]{.subs}.)

[نَحْنُ مُسْلِمَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[naHnu muslimAt.]{.trn}  
"We~3,f~ are Muslims~3,f~."

## Attached plural pronouns

We have also already learned the attached pronouns for the singular and dual participants. They too are repeated here:

|Participant | Attached pronoun|
|:------|:--|
|Absentee   sing. masc.    | [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}   "him"       |
|Absentee   sing. fem.     | [هَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn}  "her"       |
|Absentee   dual           | [هُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}  "them~2~"|
|Addressee  sing. masc.    | [كَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn}   "you~m,1~"  |
|Addressee  sing. fem.     | [كِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn}   "you~f,1~"  |
|Addressee  dual           | [كُمَا]{.ar} [-kumA]{.trn}  "you~2~" |
|Speaker    sing.          | [ي]{.ar}               "me"        |
|Speaker    dual | -- |

Now we will learn the attached pronouns for the plural participant:

|Participant | Attached pronoun|
|:------|:--|
|Absentee   pl. masc.    | [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}   "them~3,m~  |
|Absentee   pl. fem.     | [هُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn} "them~3,f~  |
|Addressee  pl. masc.    | [كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}   "you~3,m~"  |
|Addressee  pl. fem.     | [كُنَّ]{.ar} [-kunna]{.trn} "you~3,f~"  |
|Speaker    pl           | [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}    "us"        |

Note the following points about them:

+ The plural absentee-participant detached and attached pronouns ("they~3,m~"/"them~3,m~") are the same:
  + masculine: [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}.
  + feminine: [هُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn}.
+ Just like [هُ]{.ar} [hu]{.trn} "him" and [هُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn} "them~2~", the plural absentee-participant attached pronouns
[هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}   "them~3,m~" and
[هُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn} "them~3,f~"
become [هِمَا]{.ar} [-himA]{.trn} and [هِنَّ]{.ar} [-hinna]{.trn} respectively, when preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [-i]{.trn}, [◌ِي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [◌َيْ]{.ar} [-ay]{.trn}. Examples:
   + [بِهِمْ]{.ar} [bihimA]{.trn} "with them~3,m~"
   + [فِيهِنَّ]{.ar} [fIhinna]{.trn} "in them~3,f~"
   + [إِلَيْهِمْ]{.ar} [Eilayhim]{.trn} "to them~3,m~"
+ The final [0mark]{.subs} on the [مْ]{.ar} in the masculine plural pronouns ([هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}, and [كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}) becomes a [umark]{.subs} ([هُمُ]{.ar} [humu]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمُ]{.ar} [Eantumu]{.trn},  and[كُمُ]{.ar} [-kumu]{.trn} respectively) when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}. Examples:
  + [هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.]{.ar}  
    [humu -lmueallimUn.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ are the (male) teachers."
  + [ذَهَبَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
    [pahaba Eilaykumu -rrajul.]{.trn}  
    "The man went to you~3,m~."
  + [أَنْتُمُ ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ.]{.ar}  
    [Eantumu -lmuslimUn.]{.trn}
    "You~3,m~ are the Muslims~3,m~."
+ When the speaker plural attached pronoun [نَا]{.ar} is attached to a word that ends with a [نْ]{.ar} with a [0mark]{.subs}, there is only one [ن]{.ar} written and it is doubled with a [shaddah]{.subs} [◌ّ]{.ar} on it. So we get:
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [مِنْ]{.ar} = [مِنَّا]{.ar} [minnA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [عَنْ]{.ar} = [عَنَّا]{.ar} [eannA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [لَدُنْ]{.ar} = [لَدُنَّا]{.ar} [ladunnA]{.trn}
+ The preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} "for" becomes [لَ]{.ar} [la]{.trn} when followed by the plural attached pronouns:
   + [لَهُمْ]{.ar} [lahum]{.trn} "for them~3,m~"
   + [لَهُنَّ]{.ar} [lahunna]{.trn} "for them~3,f~"
   + [لَكُمْ]{.ar} [lakum]{.trn} "for you~3,m~"
   + [لَكُنَّ]{.ar} [lakunna]{.trn} "for you~3,f~"
   + [لَنَا]{.ar} [lanA]{.trn} "for us"

### Plural [mafulb]{.subs} pronouns

The plural attached pronouns that we have just learned are also used as [mafulb]{.subs} pronouns. 
<!--Again, there is no additional intervening [ن]{.ar} for the speaking participant dual attached pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}. -->
Examples:

[سَأَلَهُمُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
[saEalahumu -rrajul.]{.trn}  
"The man asked them~3,m~."

[سَأَلْتُكُمْ.]{.ar}  
[saEaltukum]{.trn}  
"I asked you~3,m~."

[سَأَلَتْكُنَّ.]{.ar}  
[saEalatkunn.]{.trn}  
"She asked you~3,f~."

[سَأَلَانَا.]{.ar}  
[saEalAnA.]{.trn}  
"They~2,m~ asked us."

[سَأَلَتَاهُ.]{.ar}  
[saEalatAh.]{.trn}  
"They~3,m~ asked him."

## Verbs with plural [fail]{.subs}s

### Plural nouns for the [fail]{.subs}

We learned that the [madi]{.subs} verb for a masculine [fail]{.subs} is on the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar}. And when the [fail]{.subs} is feminine, the [ت]{.ar} of femininity is attached to the verb thus: [فَعَلَتْ]{.ar}. We have used these verbs with singular and dual [fail]{.subs} nouns. The [fail]{.subs} noun always comes after the verb and shall be in the [ustate]{.subs}. Examples:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The boy went." 

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatun]{.trn}  
"A girl went." 

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامَانِ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmAni.]{.trn}  
"The boys~2~ went." 

[ذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jAriyatAni.]{.trn}  
"Two girls went." 

These same verbs are used when the [fail]{.subs} noun is a plural. Examples:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lmueallimUn.]{.trn}  
"The teacherm~3,m~ went." 

[ذَهَبَتْ مُعَلِّمَاتٌ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat mueallimAt.]{.trn}  
"Teachers~3,f~ went." 

### Plural pronouns for the [fail]{.subs}

We have already learned the singular and dual [fail]{.subs} pronouns. They are repeated here:

|Participant | [_fail]{.subs} pronoun |Meaning| [_fail]{.subs} pronoun with verb|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Absentee  sing. masc.   | invisible            |"he"      | [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn}|
|Absentee  sing. fem.    | invisible            |"she"     | [فَعَلَتْ]{.ar} [faealat]{.trn}|
|Absentee  dual          | [◌َا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn}     | "them~2~" | masc.: [فَعَلَا]{.ar} [faealA]{.trn}, fem: [فَعَلَتَا]{.ar} [faealatA]{.trn}|
|Addressee sing. masc.   | [تَ]{.ar} [-ta]{.trn} |"you~m,2~"| [فَعَلْتَ]{.ar} [faealta]{.trn}|
|Addressee sing. fem.    | [تِ]{.ar} [-ti]{.trn} |"you~f,2~"| [فَعَلْتِ]{.ar} [faealti]{.trn}|
|Addressee dual          | [تُمَا]{.ar} [-tumA]{.trn} | "you~2~"  | [فَعَلْتُمَا]{.ar} [faealtumA]{.trn} |
|Speaker   sing.         | [تُ]{.ar} [-tu]{.trn} |"I"       | [فَعَلْتُ]{.ar} [faealtu]{.trn}|
|Speaker   dual          | -- | "us~2~" | --|

Now we will learn the plural [fail]{.subs} pronouns:

|plural participant | [_fail]{.subs} pronoun | Meaning |[_fail]{.subs} pronoun with verb|
|:--|:--|:--|:---|
|Absentee  pl. masc.   | [و]{.ar}                 |"they~3,m~" | [فَعَلُوا]{.ar} [faealU]{.trn}|
|Absentee  pl. fem.    | [نَ]{.ar} [-na]{.trn}     |"they~3,f~" | [فَعَلْنَ]{.ar}  [faealna]{.trn}|
|Addressee pl. masc.   | [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}   |"you~m,3~"  | [فَعَلْتُمْ]{.ar} [faealtum]{.trn}|
|Addressee pl. fem.    | [تُنَّ]{.ar} [-tunna]{.trn} |"you~f,3~"  | [فَعَلْتُنَّ]{.ar} [faealtunna]{.trn}|
|Speaker   pl.         | [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}    |"we"        | [فَعَلْنَا]{.ar} [faealnA]{.trn}|

Note the following regarding the plural [fail]{.subs} pronouns:

+ The [تْ]{.ar} of femininity does not attach to the absentee  plural feminine [fail]{.subs} pronoun [نَ]{.ar} [-na]{.trn} "they~3,f~" [فَعَلْنَ]{.ar}. Example:
  
  + [ذَهَبْنَ]{.ar} [pahabna]{.trn} "they~3,f~ went"

  This is different from the behavior of the absentee dual [fail]{.subs} pronoun [◌َا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn} "them~2,f~" which, for a feminine [fail]{.subs}, does attach to the [تْ]{.ar} of femininity. Example:

  + [ذَهَبَتَا]{.ar} [pahabatA]{.trn} "they~2,f~ went"
+ The final [0mark]{.subs} on the [مْ]{.ar} in the masculine plural [fail]{.subs} pronoun [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} becomes a [umark]{.subs} [تُمُ]{.ar} [-tumu]{.trn} when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}. Examples:
  + [أَكَلْتُمْ خُبْزًا.]{.ar}  
    [Eakaltum xubzA.]{.trn}  
    "You~3,m~ ate some bread."
  + [أَكَلْتُمُ ٱلْخُبْزَ.]{.ar}  
    [Eakaltumu -lxubz.]{.trn}  
    "You~3,m~ ate the bread."
+ The absentee plural masculine verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun "they~3,m~" [و]{.ar} [U]{.trn} is written with a silent [alif]{.trn2} after it which is written only and not pronounced. This [alif]{.trn2} is dropped when a [mafulb]{.subs} pronoun is attached. For example: 
  + [ضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabu -rrajul.]{.trn}  
    "They~3,m~ hit the man.
  + [ضَرَبُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabUh.]{.trn}  
    "They~3,m~ hit him."
+ The plural masculine verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun for the addressed person "you~3,m~" [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} becomes [تُمُو]{.ar} [tumU]{.trn} when a [mafulb]{.subs} pronoun is attached. For example:
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabtumu -rrajul.]{.trn}  
    "You~3,m~ hit the man."
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabtumUh.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The plural speaking participant [fail]{.subs} pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} is the same as the plural speaking participant attached pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}. But you can tell them apart because the [fail]{.subs} pronoun, when attached to the verb, causes the final letter of the verb to have a [0mark]{.subs}. Consider the following two sentences:

  [سَأَلْنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalnA.]{.trn}  
  "We asked."

  [سَأَلَنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalanA.]{.trn}  
  "He asked us."

<!--
[سَأَلْتُمَانَا]{.ar}  
[saEaltumAnA]{.trn}  
"You~2~ asked us"

[سَأَلَتَاكُمَا]{.ar}  
[saEalatAkumA]{.trn}  
"They~f,2~ asked you~2~"

[سَأَلَاهُمَا]{.ar}  
[saEalAhumA]{.trn}  
"They~m,2~ asked them~2~"
-->

### Sentence word order with plural [fail]{.subs}s

As we've mentioned, the [fail]{.subs}, whether a noun or a pronoun, always comes after the verb. Here are a couple of examples of verbal sentences with plural [fail]{.subs}s:

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lmueallimUna EilA madrasah.]{.trn}  
"The teachers~3,m~ went to a school."

[ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabA EilA madrasah.]{.trn}  
"They~3,m~ went to a school."

[لَعِبَتِ ٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[laeibati -SSadIqAtu fi -lbayt.]{.trn}  
"The friends~3,f~ played in the house."

[لَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[laeibna fi -lbayt.]{.trn}  
"They~3,f~ played in the house."

The above verbal sentences with plural [fail]{.subs}s can be rearranged to be a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences. This gives more emphasis to the [mubtada]{.subs}. In this case, the verb shall follow the [mubtada]{.subs} and will need a [fail]{.subs} pronoun after it.

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna pahabU EilA madrasah.]{.trn}  
"The teachers~3,m~, they~3,m~ went to a school."
= "_The teachers~3,m~_ went to a school."

[ٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ لَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[EaSSadIqAtu laeibna fi -lbayt.]{.trn}  
"The friends~3,f~, they~3,f~ played in the house."
= "_The friends~3,f~_ played in the house."

If there are multiple verbs associated with the same [fail]{.subs} in a verbal sentence, the [fail]{.subs} noun will follow the first verb and the rest of the verbs will have [fail]{.subs} pronouns. For example:

[أَكَلَ ٱللَّاعِبُونَ وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -llAeibUna wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The players~3,m~ ate and they~3,m~ drank and they~3,m~ went."  
= "The players~3,m~ ate and drank and went."

The above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have [fail]{.subs} pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the [mubtada]{.subs} of the sentence.

[ٱَللَّاعِبُونَ أَكَلُوا وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EallAeibUna EakalU wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The players~3,m~, they~3,m~ ate and they~3,m~ drank and they~3,m~ went."  
= "_The players~3,m~_ ate and drank and went."

Similarly,

[أَكَلَتِ ٱللَّاعِبَاتُ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakalati -llAeibAtu wacaribna wapahabn.]{.trn}  
"The players~3,f~ ate and they~3,f~ drank and they~3,f~ went."  

and

[ٱَللَّاعِبَاتُ أَكَلْنَ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.]{.ar}  
[EallAeibAtu Eakalna wacaribna wapahabn.]{.trn}  
"The players~3,f~, they~3,f~ ate and they~3,f~ drank and they~3,f~ went."  
= "_The players~3,f~_ ate and drank and went."

<!--
## Pronouns for the plural

Here are the detached, attached, and [fail]{.subs} pronouns for the plural:

|Person|Detached pronoun|[_madi]{.subs} verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun|[_madi]{.subs} verb with [fail]{.subs} pronoun|Attached pronoun|
|:---|:----|:----|:----|
| they/them~pl.\ masc.~ |[هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}        | [◌ُو]{.ar} [-U]{.trn}     |[فَعَلُوا]{.ar} [faealU]{.trn}     |[هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}|
| they/them~pl.\ fem.~  |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [hunna]{.trn}      | [نَ]{.ar} [-na]{.trn}     |[فَعَلْنَ]{.ar} [faealna]{.trn}     |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ masc.~       |[أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}   | [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}   |[فَعَلْتُمْ]{.ar} [faealtum]{.trn}   |[كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ fem.~        |[أَنْتُنَّ]{.ar} [Eantunna]{.trn} | [تُنَّ]{.ar}  [-tunna]{.trn}|[فَعَلْتُنَّ]{.ar} [faealtunna]{.trn} |[كُنَّ]{.ar} [-kunna]{.trn}|
| we/us~pl.\ masc.\ and fem.~ |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn}     | [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}    |[فَعَلْنَا]{.ar} [faealnA]{.trn}    |[نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}|


Here are some rules for the plural pronouns:

+ The plural attached and detached pronouns for the absent person "they/them~pl.\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}.
+ Similar to the singular and dual,the pronouns for the speaking person (we, us) do not differentiate between the masculine and feminine genders plural either.
+ The speaking person pronouns are the same for the dual and plural: [نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} and [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}.
+ Similar to [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}, [هُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}, the [umark]{.subs} on the plural attached pronoun [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn} becomes an [imark]{.subs} ([هِمْ]{.ar} [-him]{.trn}) when it is preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}. Examples: 
  + [عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}, [ealayhi]{.trn} "on him"
  + [فِيهِمْ]{.ar} [fIhim]{.trn} "in them~pl.~"
  + [بِهِمْ]{.ar} [bihim]{.trn} "with them~pl.~".
+ The final [0mark]{.subs} on the [مْ]{.ar} in the masculine plural pronouns ([هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}, [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}, [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}, [كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}) becomes a [umark]{.subs} ([هُمُ]{.ar} [humu]{.trn}, [هُمُ]{.ar} [-humu]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمُ]{.ar} [Eantumu]{.trn}, [تُمُ]{.ar} [-tumu]{.trn}, [كُمُ]{.ar} [-kumu]{.trn} respectively) when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}. Examples:
  + [هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.]{.ar}  
    [humu -lmueallimUna.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ are the (male) teachers."
+ The plural masculine verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun for the absent person "they~pl.\ masc.~" [ـُوا]{.ar} [U]{.trn} has a silent [alif]{.trn2} which is written only and not pronounced. This [alif]{.trn2} is dropped when a [mafulb]{.subs} pronoun is attached. For example: 
  + [ضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "They hit the man.
  + [ضَرَبُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabUhu.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The plural masculine verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun for the addressed person "you~pl.\ masc.~" [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} becomes [تُمُو]{.ar} [tumU]{.trn} when a [mafulb]{.subs} pronoun is attached. For example:
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabtumu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit the man."
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabtumUhu.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The [ن]{.ar} in the speaking participant attached pronoun "us" [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} is part of the pronoun and is not an intervening [ن]{.ar} as was the case for the singular speaking participant pronouns. So we get:
   + [عَلَيْنَا]{.ar} [ealaynA]{.trn} "on us"
   + [بِنَا]{.ar} [binA]{.trn} "with us"

  However, when attached to a word that ends with a [نْ]{.ar} with a [0mark]{.subs}, there is only one [ن]{.ar} written and it is doubled with a [shaddah]{.subs} [◌ّ]{.ar} on it. So we get:
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [مِنْ]{.ar} = [مِنَّا]{.ar} [minnA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [عَنْ]{.ar} = [عَنَّا]{.ar} [eannA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [لَدُنْ]{.ar} = [لَدُنَّا]{.ar} [ladunnA]{.trn}
+ The preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} "for" becomes [لَ]{.ar} [la]{.trn} when followed by the plural attached pronouns:
   + [لَهُمْ]{.ar} [lahum]{.trn} "for them~3+~"
   + [لَكُمْ]{.ar} [lakum]{.trn} "for you~3+~"
   + [لَنَا]{.ar} [lanA]{.trn} "for us"
+ The plural speaking participant [fail]{.subs} pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} is the same as the plural speaking participant attached pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}. But you can tell them apart because the [fail]{.subs} pronoun, when attached to the verb, causes the final letter of the verb to have a [0mark]{.subs}. Consider the following two sentences:

  [سَأَلْنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalnA.]{.trn}  
  "We asked."

  [سَأَلَنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalanA.]{.trn}  
  "He asked us."


## Verbs with plural intelligent [fail]{.subs}s

Remember that in Arabic, a [fail]{.subs}, whether a noun or a pronoun, always after a verb. 

[ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabU EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"They~pl.\ masc.~ went to a house."

When the [fail]{.subs} is a plural noun then the plural [fail]{.subs} pronoun is not employed.

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabA -lmueallimUna EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"The teachers went to a house."

The above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence. This gives more emphasis to the [mubtada]{.subs}. In this case, the verb shall follow the [mubtada]{.subs} and will need a [fail]{.subs} pronoun after it.

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna pahabU EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"The teachers, they~pl.\ masc.~ went to a house."

If there are multiple verbs associated with the same [fail]{.subs} in a verbal sentence, the [fail]{.subs} noun will follow the first verb  and the rest of the verbs will have [fail]{.subs} pronouns. For example:

[أَكَلَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ  وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -rrajulAni wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The two men ate and they~pl.\ masc.~ drank and they~pl.\ masc.~ went."  
= "The two men ate and drank and went."

The above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have [fail]{.subs} pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the [mubtada]{.subs} of the sentence.

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ أَكَلُوا وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna EakalU wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The two men, they~pl.\ masc.~ ate and they~pl.\ masc.~ drank and they~pl.\ masc.~ went."  
= "_The two men_ ate and drank and went."
-->

### Verbs with multiple [fail]{.subs}s mentioned individually

If there are multiple [fail]{.subs}s of a verb, and each is mentioned individually, then there is often more than one way to handle them. Here we will give the more common usage.

If the verb is followed by multiple [fail]{.subs}s, only the first is the true [fail]{.subs} with respect to  modifying the verb according to its gender and number. Examples:

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -lEummu wa-lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the boy went."

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ وَٱلْأُمُّ .]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu wa -lEummu.]{.trn}  
"The boy and the mother went."

If the [fail]{.subs}s consist of different persons (speaking person, addressed person, and absent person), then they are placed in order of strength: The speaking person is stronger than the addressed person, who is stronger than the absent person. The verb [fail]{.subs} pronoun of the first (true) [fail]{.subs} is then used. Example:
  
[ذَهَبْتُ أَنَا وَأَنْتَ وَهُوَ.]{.ar}  
[pahabtu Eana waEanta wahuwa.]{.trn}  
"I, you, and he went."

Note how the speaking person detached pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} is used in addition to the [fail]{.subs} pronoun [تُ]{.ar} [-tu]{.trn} in order to add [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} "and" to it.

If the sentence is a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence, and the verb is in the [xabar]{.subs}, then the [fail]{.subs} pronoun corresponding to the number of the [mubtada]{.subs} is used. Examples:

[أنْتَ وَهُوَ ذَهَبْتُمَا.]{.ar}  
[Eanta wahuwa pahabtumA.]{.trn}  
"You~1,m~ and he, you~2~ went."

[أَنَا وَمُحَمَّدٌ ذَهَبْنَا.]{.ar}  
[Eana wamuHammadun pahabnA.]{.trn}  
"I and [_muHammad]{.trn2}, we went."

<!--If the verb follows the [fail]{.subs}s, then it will have the [fail]{.subs} pronoun corresponding to number of the [fail]{.subs}s. Example:-->

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ذَهَبَتَا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu pahabatA.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the girl went."

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ ذَهَبْنَ.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatAni pahabna.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the two girls, they~3,f~ went."

If the [fail]{.subs}s consist of both male and female persons, then the verb will have the masculine [fail]{.subs} prenoun corresponding to the number of the [fail]{.subs}s. Example:

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ وَٱلْغُلَامُ ذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu wa-lgulAmu pahabU.]{.trn}  
"The mother, the girl, and the boy, they~3,m~ went."
