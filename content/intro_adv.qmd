# The Arabic grammatical tradition



Ultimate authority is the speech of the Arabs

Rules are deduced from analyzing corpus.

Rules are formulated in order:

* explain grammar analytically
* for qiyaas

Language is very complex.

Rules can keep on refining but

Rules can reach a limit where they are not suffient to capture the complexity.

Nevertheless, rules are useful not least to explain the normative usage

Within the grammatical tradition,
some grammarians were more practical.

as a school, their rep are the kufans,

they are strong on going back to ultimate authority: speech of arabs

but weak on coming up with a harmonious framework.

Basrans are more theoretical.

They are strong on coming up with harmonious model.

But you can't put cart before horse, when using their rules.

When we find authentic usage to be contrary to rules,
then either or both:

1. Rule is not sufficiently refined, and perhaps can never be.
2. It can be an anomalous usage that is correct but not normative.

Grammarians came up with 3ilal.

They may not be historically accurate.

They are only to provide a path to lead to a harmonious grammatical model.

## theory of taqdeer

## use of [HadIv]{.trn2} as a corpus

most grammarians did not consider authoritative because of narrators in chain who narrated by meaning and not necessarily wording.

[فيصل المنصور]{.ar} [cites works of [ياسر الطريقي]{.ar}](https://archive.org/details/riga2/page/n477/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1)

* [الشواهد الحديثية في الأبواب النحوية]{.ar}
* [الاستشهاد بالحديث في المسائل النحوية]{.ar}

We will use hadith in this book because easier for student to read than poetry.
And more practical.
But just to be safe, any deduction that you find us doing purely from hadith, without being backed by an authority should be taken with a grain of salt, until and unless you are able to substantiate it.
