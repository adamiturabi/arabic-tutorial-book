# The verb [كَانَ]{.ar} {#the-verb-kaana}

## Introduction

We have learned that a verb must have a [faa3il]{.subs} in the [ustate]{.subs} and can have a [mafulb]{.subs} in the [astate]{.subs}.
In this chapter, we will learn about a new type of verb, whose [faa3il]{.subs} is called its [ism_of]{.subs}, and whose [mafulb]{.subs} is called its [xabar]{.subs}.

The principal verb of this type is [كَانَ]{.ar} which is used to mean "was". There are other verbs which behave in a similar manner and they are called the _sisters_ of [كَانَ]{.ar}.

## [كَانَ]{.ar}, its [ism_of]{.subs}, and its [xabar]{.subs}

Consider the sentence:

[ٱلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
"The man is a teacher."

This is a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence. 
[ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} is the [mubtada]{.subs} in the [ustate]{.subs}, and
[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} is the [xabar]{.subs}, also in the [ustate]{.subs}.
Arabic does not, in this case, express any word for "is".

Consider now the following sentence:

<!--
[كَانَ ٱلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمًا.]{.ar}  
"The man was a teacher."
-->


```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=2.0ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{مُعَلِّمًا} \txarb{ٱلرَّجُلُ} \txarb{كَانَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize [mafulb]{.subs}/\\\scriptsize comment};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize doer/\\\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=4.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The man was a teacher.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

Now, as you can see, Arabic does express a word for "was". It is the past verb [كَانَ]{.ar} [kAna]{.trn}.
[كَانَ]{.ar} is a hollow verb from the root [كون]{.ar}. 
It's [mudarie]{.subs} verb is [يَكُونُ]{.ar} [yakUnu]{.trn}.
The complete table for this verb for all [faa3il]{.subs} pronouns is given below:

|[#faa3il]{.subs} pronoun|past verb|[mudarie]{.subs} verb|
|:----|:----|:----|
| he        | [كَانَ]{.ar}   | [يَكُونُ]{.ar}   |
| she       | [كَانَتْ]{.ar}  | [تَكُونُ]{.ar}   |
| you~1m~   | [كُنْتَ]{.ar}   | [تَكُونُ]{.ar}   |
| you~1f~   | [كُنْتِ]{.ar}   | [تَكُونِينَ]{.ar} |
| I         | [كُنْتُ]{.ar}   | [أَكُونُ]{.ar}   |
| they~2m~  | [كَانَا]{.ar}  | [يَكُونَانِ]{.ar} |
| they~2f~  | [كَانَتَا]{.ar} | [تَكُونَانِ]{.ar} |
| you~2~    | [كُنْتُمَا]{.ar} | [تَكُونَانِ]{.ar} |
| they~3m~  | [كَانُوا]{.ar} | [يَكُونُونَ]{.ar} |
| they~3f~  | [كُنَّ]{.ar}    | [يَكُنَّ]{.ar}    |
| you~3m~   | [كُنْتُمْ]{.ar}  | [تَكُونُونَ]{.ar} |
| you~3f~   | [كُنْتُنَّ]{.ar}  | [تَكُنَّ]{.ar}    |
| we        | [كُنَّا]{.ar}   | [نَكُونُ]{.ar}   |

Like, for other verbs, 
the [faa3il]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar},
[ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}, is in the [ustate]{.subs}, and
and its [mafulb]{.subs}, [مُعَلِّمًا]{.ar}, is in the [astate]{.subs}.

However, unlike most other verbs,
the [faa3il]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar},
[ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}, is also called its [ism_of]{.subs}
and its [mafulb]{.subs}, [مُعَلِّمًا]{.ar}, is also called its [xabar]{.subs}.

So a sentence with [كَانَ]{.ar} used in this way is a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence.
If it begins with [كَانَ]{.ar} then it is also a verbal sentence at the same time.

This property also applies to the sisters of [كَانَ]{.ar} that we will learn later in this chapter. 
Together, these verbs are also called _deficient_ verbs, because, besides their [faa3il]{.subs}/[ism_of]{.subs}, they also need an [xabar]{.subs} to complete the meaning of the sentence.
That is, without the [xabar]{.subs}, the sentence is deficient.

"Is" [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences can be converted to "was" [ism_of]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences using the verb [كَانَ]{.ar}. Here are some examples:

| "is" | "was" |
|:-|:-|
| [زَيْنَبُ جَائِعَةٌ.]{.ar}  |[كَانَتْ زَيْنَبُ جَائِعَةً.]{.ar}  |
| "Zaynab is hungry." |"Zaynab was hungry."     |
| [ٱَلْغُلَامُ زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  |[كَانَ ٱلْغُلَامُ زَيْدًا.]{.ar} |
| "The boy is Zayd."  |"The boy was Zayd."     |
| [ٱَلنِّسَاءُ فِي بُيُوتِهِنَّ.]{.ar}         |[كَانَتْ ٱلنِّسَاءُ فِي بُيُوتِهِنَّ.]{.ar}     |
| "The women are in their houses." |"The women were in their houses." |
| [هُمْ مَسْرُورُونَ وَفَرِحُونَ.]{.ar}            | [كَانُوا مَسْرُورِينَ وَفَرِحِينَ.]{.ar}     |
| "They~3m~ are happy and rejoicing."  | "They~3m~ were happy and rejoicing." |
| [أَنَا نَائِمَةٌ.]{.ar}                | [كُنْتُ نَائِمَةً.]{.ar}       |
| "I~1f~ am sleeping."             | "I~1f~ was sleeping."|
| [أَنْتَ لِي أَخٌ.]{.ar}               | [كُنْتَ لِي أَخًا.]{.ar}            |
| "You~1m~ are a brother to me.   | "You~1m~ were a brother to me.|

### Sequence of [كَانَ]{.ar}, its [ism_of]{.subs}, and its [xabar]{.subs}

In sentence word order, the natural sequence is 
verb, [ism_of]{.subs}, [xabar]{.subs}.

[كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, rem.\ a, p.\ 100B]{.aside}  
"Zayd was standing."

but we may also, for the same meaning, apply the sequence verb, [xabar]{.subs}, [ism_of]{.subs}:

[كَانَ قَائِمًا زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, rem.\ a, p.\ 100B]{.aside}  
"Zayd was standing."

and also the sequence [xabar]{.subs}, verb, [ism_of]{.subs}:

[قَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, rem.\ a, p.\ 100B]{.aside}  
"Zayd was standing."

This last order is common in questions and alternative sentence sentences.
For example:

[أَقَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"Was Zayd standing?"

[ٱُدْعُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا كَانَ أَوْ جَالِسًا!]{.ar}  
"Call Zayd, be he standing or sitting!"

<!--See Wright vol. ii. Section 41 Rem a, p. 100B -->

Sometimes, however, this inversion is impossible because of an indistinguishable state of the two nouns.

For example, in order to express "My brother was my companion," we must say:

[كَانَ أَخِي رَفِيقِي.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, rem.\ a, p.\ 100C]{.aside}  
"My brother was my companion."

This is because, if we invert it, it would naturally mean:

[كَانَ رَفِيقِي أَخِي.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, rem.\ a, p.\ 100C]{.aside}  
"My companion was my brother."

The following apparent sequence is also possible:

[زَيْدٌ كَانَ قَائِمًا.]{.ar}  
"Zayd: he was standing."

But this is actually a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence.
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} is the [mubtada]{.subs}.
And the [xabar]{.subs} is [كَانَ قَائِمًا]{.ar}, which is itself a [كَانَ]{.ar} [ism_of]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence in the sequence verb, [ism_of]{.subs}, [xabar]{.subs}.
The [ism_of]{.subs} is the hidden pronoun "he" and the [xabar]{.subs} is [قَائِمًا]{.ar}.

### Plurals of non-rational beings with [كَانَ]{.ar}

Because [كَانَ]{.ar} sentences are [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} being sentences, 
many of the rules that we have learned for [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences also apply to [كَانَ]{.ar} sentences.
One such rule is that when the [mubtada]{.subs} of a sentence is a plural of non-rational beings, and the [xabar]{.subs} is a [sifah]{.subs}, then the feminine singular [sifah]{.subs} is often used. (See section\ \@ref(usage-of-plurals-of-non-intelligent-beings).)
For example:

[كَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صَغِيرَةً.]{.ar} (typical)  
"The houses were small."  

Also allowed, but not as common:  
[كَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صَغِيرَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[كَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صِغَارًا.]{.ar}  

[ٱلثِّيرَانُ كَانَتْ ضَخْمَةً.]{.ar} (typical)  
"The bulls were large."

Also allowed, but not as common:  
[ٱلثِّيرَانُ كَانَتْ ضِخَامًا.]{.ar}  
[ٱلثِّيرَانُ كُنَّ ضَخْمَاتٍ.]{.ar}  

### [كَانَ]{.ar} with a separating pronoun

Another rule that applies to [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences, and that carries over to 
[كَانَ]{.ar} sentences, is that
when the [ism_of]{.subs} and [xabar]{.subs} are both definite, 
then a separating pronoun, which is a detached pronoun that matches the [ism_of]{.subs}, can be inserted between them.
For example,

[كَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ هُمُ ٱلْفَائِزِينَ.]{.ar}  
"The believers were the winners."

The separating pronoun [هُمْ]{.ar} does not, in this case, serve to disambiguate the [xabar]{.subs} [ٱلْفَائزِينَ]{.ar} "the winners", from being a [na3t]{.subs}, as it did in sentences without [كَانَ]{.ar} (see section\ \@ref([ism_of]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs}-sentences-separating-pronoun)).
This is because the [astate]{.subs} of [ٱلْفَائزِينَ]{.ar} already tells us that it is the [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar}. 
If [ٱلْفَائزِينَ]{.ar} were a [na3t]{.subs} of the [ustate]{.subs} [ism_of]{.subs} [ٱَلْمُوْمِنُونَ]{.ar}, then it too would be in the [ustate]{.subs}, not the [astate]{.subs}.
So the separating pronoun serves more, here, to emphasize the [ism_of]{.subs}.

Most of the time, separating pronouns are used in [كَانَ]{.ar} sentences when the [ism_of]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} is itself a pronoun. Examples:

[وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْوَارِثِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/28:58>]{.aside}  
"And it is We who were the inheritors"

[كُنْتَ أَنْتَ ٱلرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/5:117>]{.aside}  
"You were the Observer over them"

Sometimes a pronoun may appear to be a separating pronoun, but actually is not one. Consider, for example, the following sentence:

[كَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ هُمُ ٱلْفَائِزُونَ.]{.ar}  
"The believers were the winners."

Note that [ٱَلْفَائِزُونَ]{.ar} is in the [ustate]{.subs}, so it is not, by itself, the [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar}.
So this is, in fact, a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence.
[ٱَلْمُوْمِنُونَ]{.ar} is the [ism_of]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar}.
The [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} is the [xabar]{.subs} [هُمُ ٱلفَائِزُونَ]{.ar}, which is itself a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence with a [ustate]{.subs} [mubtada]{.subs} ([هُمْ]{.ar}) and a [ustate]{.subs} [xabar]{.subs} ([ٱلْفَائزُونَ]{.ar}).

### Negating [كَانَ]{.ar}

Like other past verbs,
the verb [كَانَ]{.ar}
may be negated by preceding it with the particle [مَا]{.ar}. For example:

[مَا كَانَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّۭا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّۭا وَلَـٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًۭا مُّسْلِمًۭا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/3:67>]{.aside}  
"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allāh]. And he was not of the polytheists."

A similar meaning may be obtained with the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} followed by the
[0state]{.subs}
[mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُنْ]{.ar}.
This is dealt with in section\ \@ref(lam-yakun) below.

### Gender of a pronoun [ism_of]{.subs} of [كان]{.ar}

Remember from section\ \@ref(gender-of-pronoun-subject) that when the [mubtada]{.subs} of a sentence is a pronoun, 
then it may optionally either match the gender of the noun it refers to,
or the the gender of the predicate.
This rules carries over to [كَانَ]{.ar} [ism_of]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentences as well. For example:

[ذَهَبْتُ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ. وَكَانَتْ لِي عَادَةً.]{.ar}  
"I went to the market in the morning. And it was a habit for me."

[وَرَكِبُوهُمْ فَكَانَتْ هَزِيمَتَهُمْ]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §152, p.\ 298C]{.aside}  
"And they bore down upon them and it was their defeat."

Note, how, in the above examples, [كَانَتْ]{.ar} has a [ت]{.ar} of femininity to match the feminine gender of the [xabar]{.subs} [عَادَة]{.ar} "habit", and [هَزِيمَتَهُمْ]{.ar} "their defeat".

### A pronoun as the [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar}

TODO

## The [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونُ]{.ar}

The rules related to [كَانَ]{.ar}, its [ism_of]{.subs}, and its [xabar]{.subs}, that we have given above apply also to its [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونُ]{.ar}.

We will now discuss the usages of the specific states of the [mudarie]{.subs} verb.

### The [ustate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونُ]{.ar}

We have already mentioned that Arabic does not usually express any word for "is".
So when, then, is the [ustate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونُ]{.ar} used?
There are actually a few uses of this verb. We will explain them below:

#### [يَكُونُ]{.ar} used for habitual "is"

Consider the sentence, "The mother cooks the food." 
The verb "cooks" implies that the action is habitually done, not necessarily that it is being done at present. 
If we wished to say that the action is being done at present, we might instead say, "The mother _is cooking_ the food."
English maintains this distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs.
But it does not for ther verb "is".
So if we say, "The sky is blue," then it can mean both 
(i) that the sky is blue at present, or 
(ii) that it is habitually blue, not necessarily that it is blue at present.

In Arabic the situation is somewhat different.
Arabic does not usually have a distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs. So [تَطْبُخُ الْأُمُّ الطَّعَامَ.]{.ar}  may mean both
(i) that the mother is cooking the food at present, or
(ii) that she habitually does.

<!--However, interestingly, Arabic does have the distinction between the present and the habitual for the verb "is".
As you know, Arabic does not usually express a word for the present "is".-->
But for the verb "is", Arabic can distinguish between the present and the habitual.
So if we say [السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءُ]{.ar}, then this can, in general, mean both
(i) that the sky is blue at present, and
(ii) that it is habitually blue.
If we wish to emphasize the habitual meaning, we may use the [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونُ]{.ar}, thus:

[تَكُونُ السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءَ.]{.ar}  
"The sky is [habitually] blue."

While we call this the 
habitual [يَكُونُ]{.ar},
it can include a range of meanings, including
continually, recurringly, regularly, typically, generally, often, sometimes, can, may, etc.
Habitual [يَكُونُ]{.ar} is negated using [مَا]{.ar} or [لَا]{.ar}, just like other [ustate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verbs.

Here are some examples:

[قَالَ وَمَا الْبِتْعُ وَالْمِزْرُ؟ قُلْتُ شَرَابٌ يَكُونُ مِنَ الْعَسَلِ وَالْمِزْرُ يَكُونُ مِنَ الشَّعِيرِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/nasai:5604>]{.aside}  
"He said: 'What is mead and beer?' I said: 'A drink: it is from honey, and beer: it is from barley.'"
<!--(From [سنن النسائي]{.ar}:5604)-->

<!--
[إِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ لَيَعْمَلُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ حَتَّى مَا يَكُونُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَهَا إِلاَّ ذِرَاعٌ]{.ar}  
"One of you will do deeds of the people of Paradise, until there is between him and it but a forearm span"  
(Part of [HadIv]{.trn2} 2137 from [#jAmie al-#tirmipI]{.trn2})
From [جامع الترمذي]{.ar}:2137)-->

[يَكُونُ اللِّحَافُ وِسَادَةً وَلَا تَكُونُ الْوِسَادَةُ لِحَافًا.]{.ar}  
"The blanket can be a pillow but the pillow cannot be a blanket."

[مَا يَكُونُ الرَّجُلُ صَدِيقَكَ حَتّى يَصْدُقَكَ.]{.ar}  
"A man is not your friend until he is truthful to you."

##### [قَدْ يَكُونُ]{.ar} for "may be"

When the meaning "may be" is desired, the 
the [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُونُ]{.ar}
may be preceded by the particle [قَدْ]{.ar}. For example,

[قَدْ يَكُونُ الاسْتِهْزَاءُ كُفْرًا.]{.ar}  
"Mocking may be a disbelief."

#### [يَكُونُ]{.ar} used for future "will be"

Another usage of the [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُونُ]{.ar}
is for the future tense to mean "will be".
In this case, it is often preceded by [سَ]{.ar} or [سَوْفَ]{.ar}.
[سَ]{.ar} and [سَوْفَ]{.ar} are optional and are commonly dropped, especially when the context indicates the future.
Future [يَكُونُ]{.ar}
is negated by [لَا]{.ar}.
Here are some examples:

[فَقَدْ كَذَّبْتُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَكُونُ لِزَامًا]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/25:77>]{.aside}  
"For you [disbelievers] have denied, so it [i.e., your denial] is going to be adherent."  

[لا يَكونُ اللَّعَّانُونَ شُفَعَاءَ وَلَا شُهَدَاءَ يَومَ القِيَامَةِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1553>]{.aside}  
"The frequent cursers will be neither intercessors nor witnesses [on] the day of resurrection."  
([يَوْمَ]{.ar} is in the [astate]{.subs} because it is an adverb of time, see chapter\ \@ref(adverb-of-time).)

[يَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/101:4>]{.aside}  
"It is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed,"  

### The [astate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُونَ]{.ar}

Like [astate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verbs in general, [يَكُونَ]{.ar} "be" expresses the meaning of purpose, wish, or expectation. It occurs after the particles
[أَنْ]{.ar},
[لَنْ]{.ar},
[لِ]{.ar},
[كَيْ]{.ar},
[حَتَّىٰ]{.ar}, and
[إِذَنْ]{.ar}.
All this is consistent with what we have learned about [astate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verbs in chapter\ \@ref([astate]{.subs}-[mudarie]{.subs}-verbs).
Here are some examples:

[نَزَلَ بِهِ ٱلرُّوحُ ٱلْأَمِينُ. عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنذِرِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/26/193-194>]{.aside}  
"The Trustworthy Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] has brought it down. Upon your heart, [O Muḥammad] - that you may be of the warners -"

[لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْدًۭا لِّلَّهِ وَلَا ٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/4/172>]{.aside}  
"Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allāh, nor would the angels near [to Him]"

[أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ ٱلنَّاسَ حَتَّىٰ يَكُونُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/10/99>]{.aside}  
"Then, [O Muḥammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?"

### The [0state]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} {#lam-yakun}

The [0state]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} 
is used consistent with the usage of 
[0state]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verbs in general.
(See chapter\ \@ref([0state]{.subs}-[mudarie]{.subs}-verbs).)

For example:

[وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌۭ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/3/104>]{.aside}  
"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,1 and those will be the successful."

[ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/3/60>]{.aside}  
"The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters."

[لَمْ يَكُنِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم سَبَّابًا وَلاَ فَحَّاشًا وَلاَ لَعَّانًا]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6031>]{.aside}  
"The Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt} was not one who would abuse (others) or say obscene words, or curse (others)"

#### Deletion of [ن]{.ar}

The [ن]{.ar} may (irregularly) be deleted
for the [0state]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verbs that don't have a [و]{.ar} before them. 
These are:

+ [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, becomes [يَكُ]{.ar}
+ [تَكُنْ]{.ar}, becomes [تَكُ]{.ar}
+ [نَكُنْ]{.ar}, becomes [نَكُ]{.ar}
+ [أَكُنْ]{.ar}, becomes [أَكُ]{.ar}

This may only be done when the word following the verb does not begin with a connecting hamzah [ٱ]{.ar}.
Examples:

[وَلَا تَكُ فِى ضَيْقٍۢ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/16/127>]{.aside}  
"and do not be in distress over what they conspire."

[وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْـًۭٔا]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/19/9>]{.aside}  
"for I created you before, while you were nothing"

But we can't say:

$\times$ [لَمْ تَكُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  

This is because [ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar} begins with with a connecting hamzah [ٱ]{.ar}. So we have to say instead:

[لَمْ تَكُنِ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"You were not the man."


## The verb of command [كُنْ]{.ar} {#kun}

The verb of command [كُنْ]{.ar} is used to mean "Be!". Examples:

[قُلْنَا يَـٰنَارُ كُونِى بَرْدًۭا وَسَلَـٰمًا عَلَىٰٓ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/21:69>]{.aside}  
We [i.e., Allāh] said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."  

[فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُوا۟ قِرَدَةً خَـٰسِـِٔينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/2:65>]{.aside}  
"and We said to them, 'Be apes, despised.'  

The verb of command [كُنْ]{.ar} followed by the name of a person in the [astate]{.subs} is used to express one's guessing that the person whom one sees is the individual named. For example:

[كُنْ أَبَا ذَرٍّ]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §20, rem.\ b, p.\ 44C]{.aside}  
"I presume that the person approaching is [#abU #parr]{.trn2}"

[كُنْ أَبَا زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §20, rem.\ b, p.\ 44C]{.aside}  
"I guess that you are [#abU]{.trn2} Zayd."

## The complete [كَانَ]{.ar}

The verb [كَانَ]{.ar} that we have been using so far is called the _deficient_
[كَانَ]{.ar}.
It is called so because its meaning is deficient without its [xabar]{.subs}. For example, in the sentence
[كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar} "Zayd was standing,"
if we remove the [xabar]{.subs} [قَائِمًا]{.ar} then the sentence is not complete for the desired meaning.

There is another type of
[كَانَ]{.ar}
called the _complete_
[كَانَ]{.ar}.
This 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
does not need an [xabar]{.subs} to complete its meaning. 
This 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
gives the meaning of "exists".
In English, we usually express this meaning using "there was". For example,

[كَانَ مَلِكٌ.]{.ar}  
"There was a king."  
(literally: "A king was.")

Note that [مَلِك]{.ar} "king" is in the [ustate]{.subs} as the [ism_of]{.subs}.
If it were in the [astate]{.subs}, then it would change the meaning:

[كَانَ مَلِكًا.]{.ar}  
"He was a king."

Here are some more examples:

[كَانَ تَاجِرٌ وَكَانَ لَهُ بَنُونَ.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §41, p.\ 99D]{.aside}  
"There was a trader, and he had sons."

Incidentally, as you can see, the past verb of "have": "has" is expressed using [كَانَ]{.ar}:

[كَانَ عِنْدِي كِتَابٌ.]{.ar}  
"I had a book."  
(literally: "A book was for me.")

[يَكُونُ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ دَجَّالُونَ كَذَّابُونَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/muslim:7>]{.aside}  
"There will be in the end of time charlatan liars"  
[From [#HadIv]{.trn2} in [#SaHIH #muslim]{.trn2}:7]

[إِنَّهَا تَكُونُ الظُّلْمَةُ وَالسَّيْلُ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:667>]{.aside}  
"[At times there] is darkness and flooding"  

[لَمْ تَكُنِ ٱلْحَرْبُ.]{.ar}  
"The war didn't occur."  
(literally: "The war was not.")

## Time signification of the past verb [كَانَ]{.ar}

The general siginification of the past verb 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is to indicate a state that existed in the past, and that has possibly ceased.
For example:

[كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
"Zayd was standing."

This statement is regarding Zayd's state in the past and the implication is that he is possibly no longer standing.

This is the most common signification of the past verb
[كَانَ]{.ar}
and the one that we have been using so far.
But
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is special in that it admits additional significations:

The second signification of
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is to indicate a state that, at first, had not yet begun, and which then began and remained, possibly up to the present.
It has, in this sense, the meaning "became", "has become", or "happened". Examples:

[أَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/2/34>]{.aside}  
"He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers."  

[احْتَرَقَ الْخَشَبُ فَكَانَ تُرَابًا.]{.ar}  
"The wood burned and so became dust."

A third signification of
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is
to indicate a state that will be in the future.
For example:

[وَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًۭا كَانَ شَرُّهُۥ مُسْتَطِيرًۭا]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/76/7>]{.aside}  
"and [they] fear a Day whose evil will be widespread."  

A fourth signification of 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is to indicate a state that always existed and will always exist.^[<https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/3/110>]
For example:

[وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًۭا رَّحِيمًۢا]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/33/73>]{.aside}  
"And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful."  

[وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلزِّنَىٰٓ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَـٰحِشَةًۭ وَسَآءَ سَبِيلًۭا]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/17/32>]{.aside}  
"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse.1 Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way."  

## [كَانَ]{.ar} combined with other verbs

The past verb
[كَانَ]{.ar}
and its [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُونُ]{.ar}
are combined with other verbs to express complex tenses in the past and the future, respectively.
We will explain these combinations below.

### [كَانَ]{.ar} combined with a [mudarie]{.subs} verb

[كَانَ]{.ar}
is combined with a following [mudarie]{.subs} verb to express that the action of the verb was repeatedly or continually ocurring in the past.
For example:

[كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَكْتُبُ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd was writing."  
or  
"Zayd used to write."  
or  
"Zayd would write."  

This sentence can be analyzed grammatically as a [mubtada]{.subs}-[xabar]{.subs} sentence.
The [ism_of]{.subs} of 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is [زَيْد]{.ar} and it is the [mubtada]{.subs} of the sentence.
The [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} is itself a sentence [يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} "he writes", and it is the [xabar]{.subs} of the main sentence.

The order of the [ism_of]{.subs} and the [mudarie]{.subs} verb can be re-arranged for the same meaning thus:

[كَانَ يَكْتُبُ زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  

Now, two grammatical analyses are possible:

1. [زَيْد]{.ar} is the [faa3il]{.subs} of [يَكْتُبُ]{.ar}, and the [ism_of]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} is a hidden pronoun of the fact.
2. [زَيْد]{.ar} is the delayed [ism_of]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar} and [يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} is the [xabar]{.subs} of [كَانَ]{.ar}. The [faa3il]{.subs} of [يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} is a hidden pronoun.

Either way, the meaning, as we have mentioned, is the same.
Here are some more examples for different types of [faa3il]{.subs}s/[ism_of]{.subs}s:

<!--[كَانَ يُحِبُّ ٱلشِّعْرَ وٱلشُّعَرَاءَ.]{.ar}  
"He used to love poetry and the poets."
-->

[كَانَ يَعْبُدُ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.]{.ar}  
or  
[كَانَ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.]{.ar}  
"The polytheists of Makkah used to worship idols."

[كَانَتْ تُحِبُّ الصَّدَقَةَ.]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1420>]{.aside}  
"She used to love [to practice] charity."

[كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/64:6>]{.aside}  
"their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences"  
(Sound plurals, even of rational beings, may be treated as grammatically singular feminine. See section\ \@ref(sound-plurals-sing-fem).)

[كُنْتُ أَلْعَبُ بِالْبَنَاتِ عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَكَانَ لِي صَوَاحِبُ يَلْعَبْنَ مَعِي]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130>]{.aside}  
"I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and I had companions~f~ playing with me."

Occasionally, the particle [قَدْ]{.ar} precedes the combination of [كَانَ]{.ar} and the [mudarie]{.subs} verb. Example:

[قَالُوا هَذَا قَدْ كَانَ يَكْتُبُ لِمُحَمَّدٍ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/muslim:2781>]{.aside}  
"They said, 'This [person] used to transcribe for [#muHammad]{.trn2} [ﷺ]{.aralt}'"

The following [mudarie]{.subs} verb may also be an [passive]{.subs} verb. Example:

[إِنَّ أُنَاسًا كَانُوا يُؤْخَذُونَ بِالْوَحْىِ فِي عَهْدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2641>]{.aside}  
"Indeed people were (sometimes) judged (literally: held) by the [revealing of] divine inspiration in the lifetime of the Prophet."

#### One [كَانَ]{.ar} suffices multiple [mudarie]{.subs} verbs

If the signification of an action ocurring continually in the past applies to more that one [mudarie]{.subs} verb, then it is sufficient to prefix 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
to only the first one. Example:

[كَانَتْ تَعْمَلُ بِيَدِهَا وَتَصَدَّقُ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/muslim:2452>]{.aside}  
"She used to work with her hand and spend (that income) on charity."  
([تَتَصَدَّقُ]{.ar} is abbreviated to [تَصَدَّقُ]{.ar}. See section\ \@ref(form-5-verbs-abbrev).)

#### Negation of [كَانَ]{.ar} and a [mudarie]{.subs} verb

In order to negate the combination of
[كَانَ]{.ar}
and the following [mudarie]{.subs} verb,
multiple options are available. Using [يَفْعَلُ]{.ar} as an example [mudarie]{.subs} verb, we can have:

+ [مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
+ [لَمْ يَكُنْ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
+ [كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}

Examples:

[مَا كَانَ أَحَدٌ يَبْدَأُ، أَوْ يَبْدُرُ، ابْنَ عُمَرَ بِالسَّلامِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/adab:982>]{.aside}  
"No one preceded or got ahead of Ibn [#eumar]{.trn2} with (giving) the greeting."  

[كَانُوا۟ لَا يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍۢ فَعَلُوهُ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/5/79>]{.aside}  
"They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did."   

[لَمْ يَكُونُوا يَسْأَلُونَ عَنِ الإِسْنَادِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/muslim/introduction/26>]{.aside}  
"They would not ask about the chains of narration"  

In terms of the differences between these constructions
[مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
imparts more emphasis in the denial than
[كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}.

There is also difference between the options 
[مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
and
[كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
in terms of when one would be used instead of the other.^[[معاني النحو لفاضل صالح السامرائي]{.ar} 1/222].
For example, if someone says to you: "I thought I saw you writing yesterday."
To reply in the negative, you would say:
[مَا كُنْتُ أَكْتُبُ]{.ar}
instead of
[كُنْتُ لَا أَكْتُبُ]{.ar}
to mean "I was not writing."

The construction 
[مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}
is also used when one wishes to say that one never used to do something due to one's circumstances And also to mean that one did not know how to do something in the past.
For example,

[مَا كُنْتُ أَحْفَظُ شِعْرًا.]{.ar}  
"I used to not memorize any poetry."

As for
[كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ]{.ar},
it connotes an intentional or purposeful lack of doing something.
Whereas, with
[مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar},
the lack of action may be incidental.
For example,
[كَانَ لَا يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ]{.ar} "He used to not read the [quran]{.subs} imparts that the person was intentionally not doing so.
Whereas
[مَا كَانَ يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ]{.ar} does not convey the intentionality of the lack of action. For example, the person may not have been reading the [quran]{.subs} because he did not know how to.

#### The combination of [كَانَ]{.ar} with [يَكُونُ]{.ar}

Occasionally, 
[كَانَ]{.ar}
can be combined with its own [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُونُ]{.ar}
This gives the meaning "was being" or "used to be".
[يَكُونُ]{.ar} is, in this combination, often optional and may be dropped for no change in meaning. Examples:

[كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:676>]{.aside}  
and  
[كَانَ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6039>]{.aside}  
"He used to keep himself busy serving his family"

[قَدْ كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي الأُمَمِ مُحَدَّثُونَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2398>]{.aside}  
"There used to be in the nations inspired persons"  

[رِجَالٌ كَانُوا يَكُونُونَ مَعَ ٱلْمُلُوكِ]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §9, p\. 21C]{.aside}  
"men that used to be with the kings"

[كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}
[Fischer, §192, p.\ 107]{.aside}  
"He used to be in the house."

#### Possible occurrence

Sometimes
[كَانَ]{.ar}
is used with a [mudarie]{.subs} verb to express an action that could, should, or would have occurred. Examples:

[كَانَ يَكُونُ سُوءَ أَدَبٍ.]{.ar}
[Fischer, §192.3, p.\ 108]{.aside}  
"It would have been a misbehavior."

[فَقَالَ حُذَيْفَةُ أَنْتَ كُنْتَ تَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/muslim:1788>]{.aside}  
"[#Hupayfah]{.trn2} said: 'You might have done that.'"  

This meaning can also be for the future, for example in a question:

[أَىَّ شَىْءٍ كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2606>]{.aside}  
"Which thing would you do?"

#### Omission of [كَانَ]{.ar}

If one or more past verbs precedes the [mudarie]{.subs} verb 
or if the context indicates that the action was occurring in the past, then
[كَانَ]{.ar}
can be omitted, and the [mudarie]{.subs} verb is used by itself.^[Wright, vol.\ ii, §9, p.\ 21C] For example:

[قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنۢبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/2/91>]{.aside}  
"Say, "Then why did you kill the prophets of Allāh before"  
(No [كُنْتُمْ]{.ar} before [تَقْتُلُونَ]{.ar}.)

[وَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَا تَتْلُوا۟ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـٰنَ ۖ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/2/102>]{.aside}  
"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon"  
(No [كَانَتْ]{.ar} before [تَتْلُو]{.ar}.)

#### [كَانَ]{.ar} followed by a [ism_fail]{.subs} or [ism_maful]{.subs} instead of a [mudarie]{.subs} verb

Instead of a [mudarie]{.subs} verb after [كَانَ]{.ar}, its [ism_fail]{.subs} or [ism_maful]{.subs} may be used instead. 
And this can give the effect of a state of being rather than an action being done.
For example:

[كَانَ سَاكِنًا]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §74, rem., p.\ 198A]{.aside}  
"He was dwelling"

[كَانَتِ ٱلْعُصِيُّ مَرْكُوزَةً فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ.]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §74, rem., p.\ 198A]{.aside}  
"The staffs were sticking in the ground."  
([كَانَتْ تُرْكَزُ]{.ar} would imply that they were being stuck.)

When the verbal noun refers to an action taking place in the future, the idea of futurity is transferred to a past time. For example:

[أَمْرٌ كَانَ مَفْعُولًا]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §73, rem.\ a, p.\ 196A]{.aside}  
"a matter which was to be done"

### [كَانَ]{.ar} combined with a past verb

[كَانَ]{.ar}
is combined with a following past verb to denote 
an action completed prior to some past (specified or implied) point in time.
Example:

:::{.ar}
مَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ
:::
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §3, p.\ 5C]{.aside}

"[al-#racId]{.trn2} died at [#TUs]{.trn2} after (literally: and) he had set out for [#xurAsAn]{.trn2} to combat [#rAfie ibn al-#layv]{.trn2}."


The particle [قَدْ]{.ar} is often used when
[كَانَ]{.ar} is combined with a past verb.
[قَدْ]{.ar}
may be placed either between
[كَانَ]{.ar}
and the following past verb, or before
[كَانَ]{.ar}.
Examples:

[كُنْتُ قَدْ رَبَّيْتُ جَارِيَةً]{.ar}
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §3, p.\ 5C]{.aside}  
<!--[[نوادر الكرام في الجاهلية والإسلام لإبراهيم زيدان]{.ar} p.\ 13]{.aside}  -->
"I had brought up a girl"

[قَدْ كَانَتْ فَرَغَتْ مِنْ عَمَلِهَا.]{.ar}  
"She had been done with her work."

When their are multiple past verbs, and one (or more) of them occurred
farther in the past than the others, it is indicated with 
[قَدْ]{.ar},
the others having merely
[كَانَ]{.ar}.
We re-use a previous example here and extend it:

:::{.ar}
مَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ.
وَكَانَ رَافِعٌ هَـٰذَا قَدْ خَرَجَ وَخَلَعَ ٱلطَّاعَةَ وَتَغَلَّبَ عَلَىٰ سَمَرْقَنْدَ.
:::
[Wright, vol.\ ii, §3, rem.\ a, p.\ 6A]{.aside}

"[al-#racId]{.trn2} died at [#TUs]{.trn2} after he had set out for [#xurAsAn]{.trn2} to combat [#rAfie ibn al-#layv]{.trn2}.
And this [#rAfie]{.trn2} had already rebelled and cast off his allegiance and taken forcible posession of Samarqand."  
(Note how 
[قَدْ]{.ar}
is only used before 
[#rAfie]{.trn2}'s action of rebelling.)


#### Negation

This combination may, again, be negated in multiple ways. Examples:

[لاَ يَأْتِي ابْنَ آدَمَ النَّذْرُ بِشَىْءٍ لَمْ يَكُنْ قَدْ قَدَّرْتُهُ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6609>]{.aside}  
"Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate,"

[وَدِدْتُ أَنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ خَرَجْتُ الْعَامَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1778>]{.aside}  
"I wish I had not come out (for [#Hajj]{.trn2}) this year"

[وَمَا كَانَ قَدْ أَتَاهَا بِشَيْءٍ]{.ar}
[A report narrated in [[إحياء علوم الدين لأبي حامد الغزالي]{.ar} 3/139](https://shamela.ws/book/9472/885) without a chain]{.aside}  
"And he had not brought her anything"

### [يَكُونُ]{.ar} combined with a past verb

The [mudarie]{.subs} verb
[يَكُونُ]{.ar}
is compined with a past verb (often with an interposed [قَدْ]{.ar})
to express that the action is conceived of having been completed in the future.
Examples:

[يَكُونُ قَدْ وَجَبَ عَلَيْكَ صَدَقَةٌ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/mishkat:1793>]{.aside}  
"Charity will have been incumbent upon you"

[فَلْنَأْخُذْهُ فَنَكُونُ قَدْ أَخَْذْنَا عِوَضًا]{.ar}
[Fischer, §193, p.\ 108]{.aside}  
"Let us take him for (then) we will have taken a substitute"

#### [astate]{.subs} [يَكُونَ]{.ar} combined with a past verb

An [astate]{.subs} [يَكُونَ]{.ar} is combined with a past verb
to express being in a state of an action having occurred
or that might have occurred. For example:

[خَافَ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ أَخْطَأَ]{.ar}
[Fischer, §197, p.\ 110]{.aside}  
"He feared that he could have erred."

[وَيَجُوزُ أَنْ يَكُونُوا سُبِقُوا]{.ar}
[[المهذب فيما وقع في القرآن من المعرب للسيوطي]{.ar} p.\ 59]{.aside}  
"And that they might have been preceded is possible"

[يَشْتَرِطُ فِي ٱلنَّائِبِ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ حَجَّ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ]{.ar}  
"It is conditional for the [naib]{.subs} that he be in as state of already having performed the [#Hajj]{.trn2} for himself."

### Verb of command [كُنْ]{.ar} combined with a [mudarie]{.subs} verb

Ocassionally,
the verb of command [كُنْ]{.ar} is combined with a [mudarie]{.subs} verb, thus:

[كُنْ أَنْتَ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ]{.ar}
[Fischer, §222.2, p.\ 121]{.aside}  
"You be speaking to them!"

## [كَانَ]{.ar} with the [ل]{.ar} of denial

One special use of 
[كَانَ]{.ar} 
is what is termed the
[ل]{.ar}
_of denial_.
This is a negative 
[كَانَ]{.ar} 
(either
[مَا كَانَ]{.ar} 
or
[لَمْ يَكُنْ]{.ar} with the appropriate suffixes or prefixes for the [ism_of]{.subs})
followed by [لِ]{.ar}
and then an [astate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb.
This expresses the meaning of:

 i. to deny being the one to do something, or 
ii. to deny going to do something

Here are some examples:

[لَمْ تَكُنْ زَيْنَبُ لِتَضْرِبَ وَلَدَهَا]{.ar}  
"Zaynab was not one to beat her child."  
or  
"Zaynab was not going to beat her child."  

[وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ ۚ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/8/33>]{.aside}  
"But Allāh would not punish them while you, [O Muḥammad], are among them"  

[فَقَالَ أَتَخْشَيْنَ أَنْ أَقْتُلَهُ مَا كُنْتُ لأَفْعَلَ ذَلِكَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3112>]{.aside}  
"He said: Do you fear that I shall kill him ? I am not going to do that."  

[قَالَ لَمْ أَكُنْ لأَفْعَلَ]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1503>]{.aside}  
"He said: I was not going to do that."

## [كَانَ]{.ar} with the [ل]{.ar} of deserving

Closely related, yet distinct from, 
the use of
[كَانَ]{.ar} with the [ل]{.ar} of denial
(above)
is 
the use of
[كَانَ]{.ar} with a [ل]{.ar} that signifies deserving, behooving, appropriateness, or possibility.
This is, again, a negative 
[كَانَ]{.ar} 
followed by the preposition [لِ]{.ar}
and a following [istate]{.subs} noun,
and then [أَنْ]{.ar} followed by an [astate]{.subs} [mudarie]{.subs} verb.
This signifies that the action of the verb does not behoove, or is not appropriate or desrving or possibly for the person denoted by the noun after [لِ]{.ar}.^[<https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/3/79>, <https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/3/79>]
For example:

[فَأَنۢبَتْنَا بِهِۦ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍۢ مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنۢبِتُوا۟ شَجَرَهَآ ۗ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/27/60>]{.aside}  
"causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not [otherwise] have grown the trees thereof"  

[مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيَهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُوا۟ عِبَادًۭا لِّى مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ]{.ar}
[<https://quran.com/3/79>]{.aside}  
"It is not for a human [prophet] that Allāh should give him the Scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, 'Be servants to me rather than Allāh,'"

[قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ مَا كَانَ لاِبْنِ أَبِي قُحَافَةَ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم]{.ar}
[<https://sunnah.com/abudawud:940>]{.aside}  
"[#abU]{.trn2} Bakr said ; it was not befitting for the son of [#abU #quHAfah]{.trn2} to lead the prayer in the presence of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} [ﷺ]{.aralt}"
