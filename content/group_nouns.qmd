## The qualitative nouns "many" and "few"

### The qualitative noun "many"

The qualitative noun [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} is used to mean "a lot" when it is describing an uncountable quantity. For example,

[مَاءٌ كَثِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[mAEun kavIrun]{.trn}  
"a lot of water"

[ذَهَبٌ كَثِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  
[pahabun kavIrun]{.trn}  
"a lot of gold"

When used with plural countable nouns the same qualitative noun [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} is used to mean "many".  With plural non-rational nouns, we will typically use the feminine singular [كَثِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kavIratun]{.trn} consistent with what we have learned so far. Example:

[حَيَوَانَاتٌ كَثِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  
[HayawAnAtun kavIratun]{.trn}  
"many animals"

However, its usage with plural rational beings can be somewhat different from what we have learned so far.
[كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} has the sound plurals [كَثِيرُونَ]{.ar} [kavIrUna]{.trn} and [كَثِيرَاتٌ]{.ar} [kavIrAtun]{.trn}. And these can be used, as expected, with rational male and female beings respectively. It also has the broken plural [كِثَارٌ]{.ar} [kivArun]{.trn}.
However, instead of using these plurals, [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} is often used in the masculine singular when used as a qualitative noun for rational beings.

So we often see, for example,

[مُعَلِّمُونَ كَثِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[mueallimUna kavIrun]{.trn}  
"many (male) teachers"

instead of

[مُعَلِّمُونَ كَثِيرُونَ]{.ar}  
[mueallimUna kavIrUna]{.trn}  
"many (male) teachers"

although the latter is also permissible.

Similarly,

[أَنْتُمْ كَثِيرٌ.]{.ar}  
[Eantum kavIrun.]{.trn}  
"You are many (in number)."

The masculine singular [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} is also often used with plural female rational beings. For example,

[ٱلْمُعًلِّمَاتُ كَثِيرٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimAtu kavIrun.]{.trn}  
"The (female) teachers are many."

although, in this case, it is probably more common to use the [At]{.trn} plural:

[ٱلْمُعًلِّمَاتُ كَثِيرَاتٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimAtu kavIrAtun.]{.trn}  
"The (female) teachers are many."

### The qualitative noun "few"

The above discussion also applies to the opposite of [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn}: [قَلِيلٌ]{.ar} [qalIlun]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

[طَعَامٌ قَلِيلٌ]{.ar}  
[TaeAmun qalIlun]{.trn}  
"a little food"

[كُتُبٌ قَلِيلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[kutubun qalIlatun]{.trn}
"a few books"

[ٱلرِّجَالُ قَلِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
[EarrijAlu qalIlun.]{.trn}  
and  
[ٱلرِّجَالُ قَلِيلُونَ.]{.ar}  
[EarrijAlu qalIlUna.]{.trn}  
"The men are few."

[ٱلطَّالِبَاتُ قَلِيلٌ.]{.ar}
[EaTTAlibAtu qalIlun]{.trn}  
and  
[ٱلطَّالِبَاتُ قَلِيلَاتٌ.]{.ar}
[EaTTAlibAtu qalIlAtun]{.trn}  
"The (female) students are few."

### "Many people" and "few people"

The qualitative nouns [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} and [قَلِيلٌ]{.ar} [qalIlun]{.trn} can be used with the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} [min]{.trn} to express "a large quantity of" and "a small quantity of" respectively. For example,

[رَجَعَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ إِلَىٰ بُيُوتِهِمْ.]{.ar}  
[rajaea kavIrun mina -rrijAli EilA buyUtihim]{.trn}  
"A large quantity of the men returned to their homes." = "Many men returned to their homes."

Within context the qualitative nouns [كَثِيرٌ]{.ar} [kavIrun]{.trn} and [قَلِيلٌ]{.ar} [qalIlun]{.trn} can also be used by themselves to mean "a large number of people", and "a few people" respectively. Example:

[ذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ ٱلسُّوقِ كَثِيرٌ وَرَجَعَ قَلِيلٌ]{.ar}  
[pahaba Eila -ssUqi kavIrun warajaea qalIlun.]{.trn}  
"A large number [of people] went to the market and a few [people] returned."

The definite [ٱَلْكَثِيرُ]{.ar} [EalkavIru]{.trn} can be used too in this sense to mean "the many [people]". 
And the definite [ٱَلْقَلِيلُ]{.ar} [EalqalIlu]{.trn} can be used to mean "the few [people]". Example:


[عَمِلَ ٱلْقَلِيلُ وَلَعِبَ ٱلْكَثِيرُ.]{.ar}  
[eamila -lqalIlu walaeiba -lkavIru.]{.trn}  
"The few worked and the many played."
