## Introduction

Every verb has a set of _verbal-nouns_ derived from it that, despite being nouns, have a verbal meaning to them. One of these verbal-nouns is the _[maSdar]{.trn2}_, that we shall study in this chapter.

Consider the following form\ 1 verb:

| Root | Perfect verb | Stateful verb (u-state)| [maSdar]{.trn2}|
|:--|:----|:-----|:----|
|[ذهب]{.ar} | [ذَهَبَ]{.ar}  "he went" | [يَذْهَبُ]{.ar}  "he goes"|[ذَهَاب]{.ar} "going"|

The [maSdar]{.trn2} associated with this verb is [ذَهَاب]{.ar} [pahAb]{.trn}. It denotes "the action of going", or simply "going". In this section we shall learn how this and other verbal-nouns are used.

Before we proceed, we present a new method to present a verb and its meaning in this book. 
<!--Instead of giving the above table when presenting a verb, we will say:-->
We will often give a new verb in the format:

[ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar} "to go"

The perfect verb for the singular masculine absentee participant "he", the corresponding stateful verb, and their [maSdar]{.trn2} are given together, in sequence. The [maSdar]{.trn2} is given in the a-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: "to go". 

## Patterns of the [maSdar]{.trn2} for form\ 1 verbs

The patterns of the [maSdar]{.trn2} for form\ 1 verbs are very variable. It is best to learn the [maSdar]{.trn2} when you learn a new verb. Having said that, there are some general trends which may be useful to keep in mind:

1. If the verb takes a direct doee, then the perfect verb must necessarily be of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} or [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn} (because perfect verbs of the pattern [فَعُلَ]{.ar} [faeula]{.trn} never take a direct doee). In this case:
   a. The [maSdar]{.trn2} for many verbs, in general, tends to be [فَعْل]{.ar} [fael]{.trn}. Examples:
      + [فَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا]{.ar}  "to open ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [أَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا]{.ar}  "to take ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [حَمِدَ يَحْمَدُ حَمْدًا]{.ar}  "to praise ([ه]{.ar} s.o.)"
2. If the verb does not take a direct doee, then:
   a. If the perfect verb is of the pattern [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the [maSdar]{.trn2} tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فَعَل]{.ar} [faeal]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [تَعِبَ يَتْعَبُ تَعَبًا]{.ar}  "to become tired"
         + [جَزِعَ يَجْزَعُ جَزَعًا]{.ar}  "to be impatient"
         + [أَسِفَ يَأْسَفُ أَسَفًا]{.ar}  "to be sorrowful"
      ii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes being a color, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} is usually of the pattern [فُعْلَة]{.ar} [fuelah]{.trn}. Examples:
          + [خَضِرَ يَخْضَرُ خُضْرَةً]{.ar}  "to be green"
          + [سَمِرَ يَسْمَرُ سُمْرَةً]{.ar}  "to be brown"
      iii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some work or effort, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} tends to be of the pattern [فُعُول]{.ar} [fueUl]{.trn}. Example:
           + [قَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ قُدُومًا]{.ar}  "to arrive"
      iv. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some static quality, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولَة]{.ar} [fueUlah]{.trn}. Example:
          + [يَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَة]{.ar}  "to be dry"
   a. If the perfect verb is of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the [maSdar]{.trn2} tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فُعُول]{.ar} [fueUl]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [قَعَدَ يَقْعُدُ قُعُودًا]{.ar}  "to sit, stay back"
         + [سَجَدَ يَسْجُدُ سُجُودًا]{.ar}  "to prostrate down"
         + [خَضَعَ يَخْضَعُ خُضُوعًا]{.ar}  "to be humble"
      ii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes an ailment, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} is usually of the pattern [فُعَال]{.ar} [fueAl]{.trn}. Examples:
          + [سَعَلَ يَسْعُلُ سُعَالً]{.ar}  "to cough"
      iii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes travelling, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} is usually of the pattern [فَعِيل]{.ar} [faeIl]{.trn}. Examples:
           + [رَحَلَ يَرْحَلُ رَحِيلًا]{.ar}  "to depart"
      iv. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes a sound, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} is usually of the pattern [فَعِيل]{.ar} [faeIl]{.trn} or [فُعَال]{.ar} [fueAl]{.trn}, or both. Examples:
          + [صَرَخَ يَصْرُخُ صَرِيخًا وَصُرَاخًا]{.ar}  "to scream"
3. If the verb denotes a craft or a profession or a rank, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} is often of the pattern [فِعَالَة]{.ar} [fieAlah]{.trn}. Examples:
   + [تَجَرَ يَتْجُرُ تِجَارَةً]{.ar}  "to trade"
   + [أَمِرَ يَأْمَرُ إِمَارَةً]{.ar}  "to be a commander"
4. If the perfect verb is of the pattern [فَعُلَ]{.ar} [faeula]{.trn}, then the [maSdar]{.trn2} tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولَة]{.ar} [fueUlah]{.trn} or [فَعَالَة]{.ar} [faeAlah]{.trn}. Examples:
   + [صَعُبَ يَصْعُبُ صُعُوبَةً]{.ar}  "to be difficult"
   + [شَجُعَ يَشْجُعُ شَجَاعَةً]{.ar}  "to be brave"

As mentioned earlier, these are only general trends and there are many verbs that have [maSdar]{.trn2}s which don't fall under the above rules.

## Usage of the [maSdar]{.trn2}

The [maSdar]{.trn2} has properties of a noun, like state and definiteness. But it gives the meaning of a verb. For example, consider the verb [أَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا]{.ar}  "to eat". We can use its [maSdar]{.trn2} in a sentence like this:

[فَرَغَ زَيْدٌ مِنَ ٱلْأَكْلِ.]{.ar}  
[faraga zaydun mina -lEakli.]{.trn}  
"Zayd got done with eating."

Note how the [maSdar]{.trn2} [ٱلْأَكْلِ]{.ar} [EalEakli]{.trn} gives the meaning of the action of the verb "eating". But since it is a noun, it obeys the rules for nouns, like being in the i-state when preceded by the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} [min]{.trn}.

Another point worth noting is that we have made it definite by saying [ٱَلْأَكْلِ]{.ar} [EalEakli]{.trn} instead of saying [أَكْلٍ]{.ar} [Eaklin]{.trn} for the meaning of "eating". This is because, as we explained in section 
\@ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns),
the definite noun is usually used in Arabic to give a general meaning, where in English we would not use "the". This may be a good time to re-read that section.

Having said that, the indefnite [maSdar]{.trn2} may be used too, and this will give the meaning of "a certain", or "a specific". For example, with the verb [عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا]{.ar}  "to work", we can say:

[فَرَغَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَعْبٍ.]{.ar}  
[faraga min eamalin Saebin.]{.trn}  
"He got done with a [certain] difficult work."

## Multiple [maSdar]{.trn2}s for the same verb

It is possible, and fairly common, for verbs to have more than one [maSdar]{.trn2}. Usually, each of the [maSdar]{.trn2}s has its own meaning, distinct from each other.

For example, the verb [حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلًا]{.ar}  means "to carry ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)" Here is an example of its [maSdar]{.trn2} in a sentence:

[تَعِبَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ حَمْلِهِ لِلْكُتُبِ ٱلثَّقِيلَةِ.]{.ar}  
[taeiba zaydun min Hamlihi lilkutubi -vvaqIlati.]{.trn}  
"Zayd became tired from his carrying the heavy books."

There exists another meaning for this verb with its own [maSdar]{.trn2}: [حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلَةً]{.ar}  which means "to launch an attack ([عَلَىٰ]{.ar} on s.o.)" Here is an example of its [maSdar]{.trn2} in a sentence:

[دَهِشَ ٱلْقَوْمُ مِنْ حَمْلَةِ ٱلْعَدُوِّ عَلَيْهِمْ.]{.ar}  
[dahica -lqawmu min Hamlati -leaduwwi ealayhim.]{.trn}  
"The people were astonished at the attack launched by the enemy on them."

Sometimes the meaning between the multiple [maSdar]{.trn2}s is only slight. Consider, for example, the verb [جَهِلَ يَجْهَلُ]{.ar}  "to not know, or to be ignorant ([هـ]{.ar} of s.th.)"

It has two [maSdar]{.trn2}s: [جَهْلٌ]{.ar} [jahl]{.trn} and [جَهَالَة]{.ar} [jahAlah]{.trn} which have meanings that are close to each other.

[جَهْلٌ]{.ar} [jahl]{.trn} is the more simple [maSdar]{.trn2} used for not knowing something. For example,

[مَا فَعَلَ زَيْدٌ ٱلْوَاجِبَ لِجَهْلِهِ إِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
[mA faeala zayduni -lwAjiba lijahlihi EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  
"Zayd did not do the obligatory [work] because of his not knowing it."

[جَهَالَة]{.ar} [jahAlah]{.trn} has the more abstract meaning of "ignorance". For example,

[نَفَرَ ٱلْمُسْلِمُ مِنْ جَهَالَةِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ.]{.ar}  
[nafara -lmuslimu min jahAlati -lmucrikIna.]{.trn}  
"The Muslim was repulsed by the ignorance of the pagans."

As a general rule of thumb, the fewer letters in a [maSdar]{.trn2}, the simpler its meaning. And [maSdar]{.trn2}s of the pattern [فَعَالَة]{.ar} [faeAlah]{.trn} tend to have an abstract meaning.

<!--
## [maSdar]{.trn2}s re-used as common nouns

There are many [maSdar]{.trn2}s, that in addition to their verbal meaning, are also re-used as common nouns. Their common noun meaning is typically associated, in some manner, with their verbal meaning.


For example, the verb [سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا]{.ar}  means "to question or ask ([ه عن]{.ar} s.o. about s.th.)". The [maSdar]{.trn2} [سُؤَالٌ]{.ar} [suEAlun]{.trn} can be used with its verbal meaning: "questioning". For example,

[سَئِمَ ٱلْأَبُ مِنْ كَثْرَةِ سُؤَالِ ٱبْنِهِ إِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
[saEima -lEabu min kavrati suEAli -bnihi EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  
"The father became weary from the excessiveness of his son's questioning him."

[سُؤَالٌ]{.ar} [suEAlun]{.trn}, in addition to being a [maSdar]{.trn2} "questioning" is re-used as a common noun with the meaning "a question" and the broken plural [أَسْئِلَة]{.ar} [EasEilah]{.trn} "questions". So, for example, we can say:

[كَتَبَ ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ سُؤَالًا عَلَى ٱلسَّبُّورَةِ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -lEustApu suEAlan eala -ssabbUrati.]{.trn}  
"The professor wrote a question on the board."

## Common nouns re-used as [maSdar]{.trn2}s

Just as some [maSdar]{.trn2}s are re-used as common nouns, there are some common nouns that may be re-used as [maSdar]{.trn2}s. For example, the verb [فَعَلَ يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}  "to do ([هـ]{.ar} an action)" has the [maSdar]{.trn2} [فَعْلٌ]{.ar} [faelun]{.trn}.

There is an associated common noun from this root: [فِعْلٌ]{.ar} [fielun]{.trn} "an act". This common noun is frequently used in place of the [maSdar]{.trn2} [فَعْلٌ]{.ar} [faelun]{.trn}. For example:

[طَلَبَ ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ مِنَ ٱلتَّلَامِيذِ فِعْلَ ٱلْوَاجِبِ.]{.ar}  
[Talaba -lEustApu mina -ttalAmIpa fiela -lwAjibi.]{.trn}  
"The professor wanted from his students the doing of the obligatory [work]."
