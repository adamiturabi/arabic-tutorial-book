## History of the Arabic grammatical tradition

<!--
By the end of the second century after the Hijrah,
we have the the first extant book on Arabic grammar titled _The Book_,
by a famous grammarian of the name [#sIbawayh]{.trn2}.

The earliest extant book on Arabic grammar
is titled
[الْكِتَاب]{.ar} [The Book]{.trans},
written
by the famous [#baSran]{.trans} grammarian [#sIbawayh]{.trn2} (died 185\ [ah]{.smallcaps}).
[#sIbawayh]{.trn2}'s _Book_ is a remarkably comprehensive
-->


During the time of the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt},
the Arabs spoke Classical Arabic natively.

After the time of the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt},
<!--
when the borders of the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic state had expanded beyond the Arabian peninsula,
-->
<!--
there was an 
increased intermingling between Arab and non-Arab populations.
Because of this,
-->
<!--
the native speech of the Arabs began to
diverge from the Classical Arabic of the generation of the Companions of the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt}.
-->
during
the [#racidUn]{.trn2} caliphate (11--41\ [ah]{.smallcaps}),
the borders of the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic state had expanded beyond the Arabian peninsula.
This brought upon an increased intermingling between Arab and non-Arab populations,
especially in the towns and urban centers.

There are
reports that,
during this time,
there was an increased occurrence of grammatical
and pronunciation errors in spoken Arabic,
especially by non-Arabs and the newer generation.
<!--
the older generation noticed that the kind of Arabic which was being spoken
on the street,
and by the newer generation,
had begun to diverge from the Classical Arabic of the generation of the Companions of the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt}.
Here are some examples of these reports:
-->

The reports also claim, that in order to safeguard the Qurʾān from
being read incorrectly,
efforts began to preserve Classical Arabic.
This outline of events is traditionally credited as
the inception of the Arabic grammatical tradition,
and of the profession of the grammarian.

It is difficult to establish the authenticity of many of these reports.
So we are not certain
who would qualify to be the first grammarians,
nor are we certain of the extent of their grammatical discourse.
We do know that
the early grammarians 
of the first and early second centuries\ [ah]{.smallcaps},
were definitely able to distinguish between correct and incorrect language.^[Carter, _Sībawayhi's principles_ 5--6]
But their terminology and grammatical analysis
were presumably rudimentary.^[Baalbaki, Introduction to _The early Islamic grammatical tradition_ xv; [[من تاريخ النحو العربي لسعيد الأفعاني]{.ar} 29--30, footnote\ 2](https://shamela.ws/book/9937/27#p1)]

However,
in the latter half of the second century\ [ah]{.smallcaps},
Arabic grammar had already developed,
from these primitive beginnings,
into a highly developed system of linguistic analysis.^[Baalbaki, Introduction to _The early Islamic grammatical tradition_ xiii]

Initially,
grammatical research was centered mainly
in two places:
the cities of [al-#baSrah]{.trn2}
and [al-#kUfah]{.trn2},
in Iraq.
These
[#baSr]{.trn2}an
and
[#kUf]{.trn2}an
schools were mainly active,
in their eponymous cities,
into the third century\ [ah]{.smallcaps}.
After that, grammarians would still often be affiliated academically
with one of the two schools,
but they were more geographically widespread.
Many famous later grammarians operated out of
[#bagdAd]{.trn2}, Egypt, Syria, Persia, and [al-#andalus]{.trn2} ([#islAm]{.trn2}ic Spain).

## Attested usage ([السَّماع]{.ar})


In order to develop a grammatical framework for Classical Arabic,
the grammarians first needed a collection of authentic Classical Arabic texts.
The grammarians 
used,
as their source material for this collection,
a corpus of Classical Arabic texts, which we will term _attested usage_.
The body of attested usage can be categorized into^[from Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 16]:

1. Transmitted texts. These include:
   a. Authorized readings of the Qurʾān
   b. Poetry of the pre-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic and early [#islAm]{.trn2}ic poets
   c. A collection of the sayings and proverbs of the Arabs
   d. the [#HadIv]{.trn2}
2. Elicited speech

We will discuss these categories below:

#### The Qurʾān {.unnumbered}

The Qurʾān was transmitted by the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt} to his Companions.
When the territories under the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic caliphate expanded,
many of the Companions were sent or relocated to the different areas under Muslim rule,
and there, they began teaching the Qurʾān to their students from the [#tAbieIn]{.trn2}.
Those students taught it to the next generation and so on and so forth.
The text of the Qurʾān was thus available to the grammarians
and used by them as a primary linguistic source.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 18--19, [[القياس النحوي لخالد حسين أبو عمشة]{.ar} 7](https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/97698/read?part=1&page=7&index=5343316)]

#### Poetry {.unnumbered}

From pre-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic times into the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic era,
Classical Arabic poetry was composed and transmitted orally,
from region to region, and from generation to generation.
The grammarians used this transmitted poetry as their second major source of transmitted data.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 19]

Some native Arabic dialects were beginning to diverge from Classical Arabic in the first and second century\ [ah]{.smallcaps}.
Because of this,
the grammarians were more discerning in whether they would accept the poetry of a later poet.
Generally they would only accept the poetry of a later poet if his language was determined to be uninfluenced by the newer developments in the native dialects.
The grammarians generally have a cut-off date somewhere in the middle of the first century\ [ah]{.smallcaps}.
Poetry composed after this cut-off date is typically not accepted as a valid source of Classical Arabic.^[[[القياس النحوي لخالد حسين أبو عمشة]{.ar} 8](https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/97698/read?part=1&page=8&index=5343317)]

#### Sayings and proverbs of the Arabs {.unnumbered}

A small portion of prose material,
consisting of sayings and proverbs of the Arabs,
is also generally accepted as a source of Classical Arabic data.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 16, [[القياس النحوي لخالد حسين أبو عمشة]{.ar} 7--8](https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/97698/read?part=1&page=7&index=5343316)]

#### The [#HadIv]{.trn2} {.unnumbered}

The [#HadIv]{.trn2} of the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt} were transmitted by his Companions
to their students from the [#tAbieIn]{.trn2},
who then transmitted them to their students from the next generation, and so on.
Theoretically, the [#HadIv]{.trn2} texts should be considered a valid source of Classical Arabic.
However, as a trend, the grammarians were reluctant to consider the transmitted [#HadIv]{.trn2} texts as part of attested usage.
This is because they feared that some of the narrators in the chains of transmission of [HadIv]{.trn2} may have narrated their [HadIv]{.trn2} by meaning, rather than verbatim text.
And if the narrator was himself not a native Classical Arabic speaker,
then the grammarians could not be certain that the [HadIv]{.trn2} that reached them was correct Classical Arabic.
They did not have this view regarding the Qurʾān and poetry
because the Qurʾān and poetry required that they be transmitted verbatim.

This policy of the grammarians has received some criticism,
with some researchers deeming that they were unnecessarily exclusive,
and that if the transmitters of a [HadIv]{.trn2} are deemed competent, then the [HadIv]{.trn2} should be admitted into attested usage.
In this sense, [#HadIv]{.trn2} texts
should be considered at least as acceptable as poetry,
since the possibility of variation in transmission is applicable to both.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 16--17, [[القياس النحوي لخالد حسين أبو عمشة]{.ar} 7--8](https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/97698/read?part=1&page=7&index=5343316)]
In any case, we note that if the grammarians erred then it was on the side of caution.

#### Elicited speech {.unnumbered}

In addition to the transmitted texts mentioned above,
the grammarians also used,
as part of their source data,
samples of speech that they obtained themselves by
meeting and talking to native Classical Arabic speaking _informants_.
Such informants continued to exist, in pockets,
into the second and third centuries\ [ah]{.smallcaps}.
In general, the speech of the bedouin Arabs was considered purer and more free from errors
than that of the urban population.
The grammarians would seek out such informants,
listen to their ordinary speech in natural settings,
and also ask them questions,
the answers to which would betray insight into
the grammatical issues that they were investigating.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 22-24]

#### Exclusion of the grammarians' writings from attested usage {.unnumbered}

The grammarians were scholars of Classical Arabic.
Yet, generally speaking, they were not native speakers of Classical Arabic.
So even though they were knowledgeable in analyzing Classical Arabic,
they had not learned it natively.
So their writings are not considered attested usage.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 36--37]
Excepted are
examples that the grammarians made up and adduced to explain a particular grammatical issue.^[Suleiman, _The Arabic grammatical tradition: A study in ta‘līl_ 16]
Those are admitted into attested usage, though subject to critique by other grammarians.^[Here is an example:  
[... ولم يذكره [سيبويه] إلا في نفس عبارته قال «وذلك عجبت من ضرب زيد عمرًا»، وليس في لفظه ما يدل على أنه محكي عن العرب، فيحتمل أن يكون ذلك رأيًا منه، بل هو ظاهر كلامه وقياس منه]{.ar}  
[[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 11/75](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/3610)]{.citex}]

## Analogy ([القِياس]{.ar}) and grammatical reason ([العِلّة]{.ar})

Once the source material from attested usage was available to the grammarians,
they set about analyzing it
<!--
They did this by
observing patterns in attested usage,
-->
in order to develop a grammatical framework
<!--
that accommodated those patterns.
-->
The process of developing a grammatical framework is based on
_analogy_ and _grammatical reason_.

Analogy is the process of observing a pattern in attested usage,
determining a grammatical reason for the pattern,
and expounding a grammatical rule that states that whenever the grammatical reason is found,
then the pattern is to be expected.^[[القياس النحوي لخالد حسين أبو عمشة]{.ar} 4--5]

Let's explain what we mean.

Let's say,
hypothetically,
a grammarian goes through the data in attested usage, and comes across sentences like:

(@) [**جَاء الرَّجُلُ**]{.ar}  
    [The man came.]{.trans}  

(@) [**ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ** عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

(@) [**يَدْخُلُ** الْبَيْتَ **رَجُلٌ**]{.ar}  
    [A man enters the house.]{.trans}  

(@) [لَنْ **يَضِيعَ الْعَمَلُ** الصَّالِحُ]{.ar}  
    [The good deed shall not go waste.]{.trans}  

(@) [لَمْ **تَذْهَبْ هِنْدٌ**]{.ar}  
    [Hind did not go.]{.trans}  

<!--
(By the way, the above examples are made up and probably not actually found in attested usage.)
-->
When the grammarian studies these sentences he notes that they are all verbal sentences
consisting of (at least) a verb and its doer.
He also observes a pattern.
And that is
that the doer of the verb is always in the u-state.
Now, he comes up with a grammatical rule that states that
whenever there is a verbal sentence (this is our grammatical reason),
then the doer of the verb is be in the u-state.

This rule is made for the benefit of the student
who has not gone through the data in attested usage.
Let's say that a student is reading a text and comes across a sentence:

(@) [ضَرَبَ عَمْرًا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

The student determines that this is a verbal sentence.
Being a verbal sentence is the grammatical reason that makes the above
analogy-based rule
applicable.
Now the student observes that [ضَرَبَ]{.ar} is the verb,
and following it are two nouns:
[عَمْرًا]{.ar} in the a-state,
and
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the u-state.
Applying the rule, he detrmines that the person who did the beating is Zayd, not [#eamr]{.trn2}.
This will give him a correct understanding of the text.

Furthermore, if the student wishes to construct his own verbal sentence,
attempting to conform to [sca]{.smallcaps},
then he knows that
he will have to put the verb's doer in the u-state.

## Anomalous usage ([الشَّاذّ]{.ar})

Sometimes a pattern occurs often enough in attested usage that a rule is built upon it using
analogy.
However, occurrences contrary to the pattern are also found in attested usage.
This usage which is contrary to analogy is called _anomalous usage_.

Let's take a look at an example of anomalous usage.
When the second letter of a root is [و]{.ar},
then its stem-10 perfect verb is regularly formed
by transforming the [و]{.ar} into an alif.
This is done according to analogy.
For example:

|Root| stem-10 perfect verb |
|:--|:------|
|[قوم]{.ar} | [اسْتَقَامَ]{.ar} [to be steadfast]{.trans}|
|[عوذ]{.ar} | [اسْتَعَاذَ]{.ar} [to seek refuge]{.trans} |
|[نور]{.ar} | [اسْتَنَارَ]{.ar} [to seek light]{.trans}  |

In anomalous usage, a few roots whose middle letters are [و]{.ar},
usually form their stem-10 perfect verbs
by keeping the [و]{.ar}. For example:

|Root| stem-10 perfect verb |
|:--|:------|
|[حوذ]{.ar} | [اسْتَحْوَذَ]{.ar} [to gain mastery, overcome]{.trans}|
|[صوب]{.ar} | [اسْتَصْوَبَ]{.ar} [to consider ([هـ]{.ar} s.th) to be right]{.trans}|

By the way,
[اسْتَحَاذَ]{.ar} and [اسْتَصَابَ]{.ar}
are also found in attested usage, albeit less frequently.

The general principle, when dealing with anomalous usage,
is that it should
be limited to what is found in attested usage,
and
not be extended by analogy.

So the rule for forming stem-10 perfect verb for roots
that have [و]{.ar} as the middle letter,
is that
the verbs should be formed
generally by transforming the [و]{.ar} into an alif, like
[اسْتَقَامَ]{.ar}
and
[اسْتَعَاذَ]{.ar}.
But for the few verbs that fall into anomalous usage,
we should prefer to keep the [و]{.ar}, thus:
[اسْتَحْوَذَ]{.ar}
and
[اسْتَصْوَبَ]{.ar}.
The forms
[اسْتَحَاذَ]{.ar} and [اسْتَصَابَ]{.ar}
are permissible but less preferred.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 40]

The grammarians have not always agreed over how to deal with different anomalous usages.
As an example,
when an adjectival noun is on the pattern
[أَفْعَل]{.ar},
like
[أَبْيَض]{.ar} [white]{.trans}
and
[أَسْوَد]{.ar} [black]{.trans},
then
a comparative noun for it on the same pattern
[أَفْعَل]{.ar}
is regularly not found to be used in attested usage.
So 
[أَبْيَض]{.ar}
is not usually found in attested usage to mean [more white]{.trans}.
However, this meaning is found as anomalous usage, as in the verse of poetry:

(@) [جَارِيَةٌ فِي دِرْعِهَا الفَضْفَاضِ ~ **أَبْيَضُ** مِنْ أُخْتِ بَنِي إِبَاضِ]{.ar}
    [[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 42]{.citex}  
    [A girl in her full long shirt ~ **whiter** than a [woman of the tribe] of [#banU #ibAD]{.trn2}]{.trans}  

Some grammarians were of the opinion,
that because of the usage of
[أَبْيَض]{.ar} in the above verse to mean [whiter]{.trans},
this can be extended by analogy generally.
So whenever a adjectival noun is on the pattern
[أَفْعَل]{.ar},
a comparative noun can also be formed for it on the same pattern.
Other grammarians were more conservative and did not extend this usage by analogy.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 42]

## The balance between analogy and attested usage

The ultimate authority for what is correct Classical Arabic is attested usage.
Analogy-based rules are a means to understand [sca]{.smallcaps} correctly,
and a guide to form sentences that attempt to conform to [sca]{.smallcaps}.

Analogy
is a speculative process on the part of the grammarians.^[Baalbaki, "Teaching Arabic at university level" 86]
As such, it is subjective, and
rules derived from analogy may need to be revised and refined in order to sufficiently explain the language.
Natural language,
however,
is very complex and
analogy-based rules,
even if continually revised and refined,
can perhaps never capture its full complexity.

Because of this,
attested usage, in general, should not be rejected on the basis of analogy.
And an analogy, even if it were sound, should not be applied if it
leads to something that is contrary to attested usage.^[[[الانتصار لسيبويه على المبرد لابن ولاد]{.ar} 204](https://shamela.ws/book/29555/164#p1) cited by Baalbaki, "The book in the grammatical tradition" 130]


## Classical Arabic dialects and [sca]{.smallcaps}

Classical Arabic consisted of multiple dialects
that were spoken by the various tribes of the Arabs
in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula.

When the grammarians
<!--
developed analogy-based rules from attested usage,
-->
analyzed the data in attested usage,
they would list the variations of usage found in the different dialects.
Generally speaking, all variations were accepted by the grammarians as correct Classical Arabic.
However, the grammarians would also often grade the variations,
sometimes listing one or another option amongst the variations as the
more common, normative, eloquent, or original.

<!--
the usages in the different dialects.
For forming analogy-based rules,
the grammarians would often select,
out of the various usages,
a more commnormative one, or a more eloquent one,
or a more preferred one, or what they deemed a more original one.
Even within a dialect, sometimes there are multiple permissible ways to construct an expression.

Standard Classical Arabic ([sca]{.smallcaps}) is the _de facto_ standard variety
of Classical Arabic
that became dominant through,
amongst other factors,
the
widespread adoption of the grammarians' rules.
-->

Standard Classical Arabic ([sca]{.smallcaps}) is a
<!--
_de facto_ standard
-->
variety
of Classical Arabic
that reflects these gradings.

As an example,
the grammarians discuss a dialectal usage that pluralizes a verb even when the plural doer is mentioned.
So speakers of this dialect would say:

(@) [ضَرَبُونِي قَوْمُكَ]{.ar}
    [[[كتاب سيبويه]{.ar} 2/40](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/475)]{.citex}  
    [Your people beat me.]{.trans}  

instead of the more normative:

(@) [ضَرَبَنِي قَوْمُكَ]{.ar}

The dialectal usage of example ()
is graded as rare.^[[[كتاب سيبويه]{.ar} 2/40](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/475)]
It did not make its way into [sca]{.smallcaps}.
Instead, the more common usage in example () became the standard.

## Virtual modeling ([التَّقْدِير]{.ar})

When the grammarians were analyzing attested usage, they observed that
there is an underlying harmony and order in the Classical Arabic language,^[ Baalbaki, "Some aspects of harmony and hierarchy in Sībawayhi's grammatical analysis"  7ff]
such that it could be described with a set of
coherent and comprehensive
basic principles.
But
these principles often will not describe surface speech directly.
(_Surface speech_ is defined as the literal utterance that is spoken by the speaker and heard by the listener.)
This is because surface speech,
even when not anomalous usage,
has too much variation and complexity to be wrangled
into a minimalist framework of grammatical principles directly.

For example,
oftentimes, two surface speech utterances can differ in their apparent form.
Nevertheless, there would seem to be a common grammatical principle at work
that directs the structure of both surface speech utterances.

In order to describe the language using grammatical principles,
the grammarians theorized
a _virtual model_
of the surface speech.
This virtual model would exist only in the mind of the speaker,^[Levin, "The theory of al-taqdīr and its terminology." 142--143]
under the level of surface speech.
The links between inter-related linguisitic phenomena would be more evident in the virtual model
than in surface speech.
The virtual model would be simpler in its structure, and have less variation, than surface speech.
It would thus
be
more amenable to being described by a set of basic principles.

<!--
Based on the above observations,
the grammarians' goal was to come up with a set of basic principles for Classical Arabic
that was coherent and comprehensive.
In doing so,
they would theorize a _virtual model_
of the surface speech,
when needed,
and build their grammatical system based on the virtual model.
-->


<!--
that exists only in the speech unit of mind of the speaker.^[Levin, "The theory of al-taqdīr and its terminology." 142--143]
This _virtual model_
was more amenable to being wrangled into 
organized rules.


In analyzing attested usage,
the grammarians were
attempting to build a comprehensive and coherent grammar of Classical Arabic.
During this process, they saw that natural speech,
even when not anomalous usage,
was often too complex to be codified
compactly.
But
they also realized that
under the literally uttered speech
(termed _surface speech_),
there could be modeled a _virtual_ utterance
that existed only in the mind of the speaker.^[Levin, "The theory of al-taqdīr and its terminology." 142--143]
This _virtual model_
was more amenable to being wrangled into 
organized rules.

The grammarians then 
considered it their role to theorize a virtual model,
when needed,
under the surface speech,
and to build their grammatical framework based on the virtual model.
-->

We will further explain virtual modeling by going through some examples in the section below:

### Examples of virtual modeling

#### A virtual model of latent doer pronouns

Let's say that a hypothetical grammarian goes through some data in attested usage,
and he finds surface speech samples like the following:

(@) [قَرَأَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd read.]{.trans}  

(@) [رَجَعَتْ هِنْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Hind returned.]{.trans}  

(@) [يَذَهَبُ الرِّجَالُ]{.ar}  
    [The men go.]{.trans}  

The grammarian asks his native Classical Arabic speaking informant
what the informant understands by the above samples.
The informant tells the grammarian that he understands each one as having a complete meaning:
a meaning
that expresses
an action
(signified by the first word),
and the doer of that action,
(signified by the second word).

Because each sample has a complete meaning,
the grammarian
determines that each sample is a complete sentence.
He
classifies the first word in each sentence as a verb,
and the second word as a noun.
Based on the abundance of sentences like the above,
the grammarian formulates a principle,
which is that a verbal sentence needs two parts to be a complete sentence:
a verb, followed by its doer (noun).

The grammarian 
then continues going through attested usage
and finds surface speech samples like the following:

(@) [تَصَدَّقْنَ]{.ar}  
    [They~f~ gave charity.]{.trans}  

(@) [عَمِلْتُ]{.ar}  
    [I worked.]{.trans}  

(@) [تَكْتُبَانِ]{.ar}  
    [You~2~ are writing.]{.trans}  

(@) [ذَهَبُوا]{.ar}  
    [They went.]{.trans}  

Consulting
his informant, he
finds that these also are complete sentences in their meaning.
The informant tells him that the doer of each action is now a person who is not named,
but who is known to the informant.
So the grammarian classifies the doers as _pronouns_.
<!--
But the doers of the verbs here are not expressed as common or proper nouns.
Rather, the  sentences' meanings signify that the doers are pronouns.
-->

The grammarian also notices that the end of each verb is modified and extra sounds
(expressed by letters in the script)
are added after it.
For example:
[عَمِلَ\ +\ تُ\ =\ عَمِلْتُ]{.ar} 
Based on these observations,
the grammarian
devises a way, by which
these sentences can still be molded to fit into his above stated principle.
This is
by considering
the extra sounds/letters at the end of the verbs
(for example, [تُ]{.ar} in [عَمِلْتُ]{.ar})
to be the doer pronouns.
Now
the sentences can be considered to have two parts: a verb followed by its doer.
So far so good.

But now the grammarian comes across surface speech samples like the following:

(@) [ذَهَبَ]{.ar}  
    [He went.]{.trans}  

(@) [رَجَعَتْ]{.ar}  
    [She returned.]{.trans}  

(@) [أَعْمَلُ]{.ar}  
    [I work.]{.trans}  

(@) [نَتَصَدَّقُ]{.ar}  
    [We give charity.]{.trans}  

These samples pose a problem for our grammarian.
Because his informant tells him that he still understands these samples,
in context, to have a complete meaning.
The doer of each action is again a person who is not named but who is known to the informant.

So, evidently, samples () through () are complete sentences with pronoun doers,
just like samples () through ().
But the problem is that there are no apparent extra sounds/letters after the verbs which can be considered the doer.

Some of the verbs in these sentences,
like in examples () and (),
have extra sounds, but they are before the verb.
But some verbs,
like in example (),
don't even have that.
Example () [رَجَعَتْ]{.ar}
does have an extra [تْ]{.ar} after the verb,
but that letter is kept when there is an overt doer noun,
like in example () [رَجَعَتْ هِنْدٌ]{.ar}
above.
So the [تْ]{.ar} doesn't seem like it can be the doer.
So what is the grammarian to do?

In order to keep the principle consistent,
the grammarian virtually models _latent_ doers for these sentences.
For example () above, the latent doer is virtually modeled as [[هُوَ]{.ar}], thus:

(@) [ذَهَبَ [هُوَ]]{.ar}  
    [He went.]{.trans}  

Now the sentence has two parts:
the verb
[ذَهَبَ]{.ar}, followed by it's doer, the virtually modeled [[هُوَ]{.ar}].
Thus it is compliant with the above stated principle that the grammarian developed for verbal sentences.

Here are the other examples with their virtually modeled doers:

(@) [رَجَعَتْ [هِيَ]]{.ar}  
    [She returned.]{.trans}  

(@) [أَعْمَلُ [أَنَا]]{.ar}  
    [I work.]{.trans}  

(@) [نَتَصَدَّقُ [نَحْنُ]]{.ar}  
    [We give charity.]{.trans}  

In this way, a grammarian was able to formulate a analogy-based grammatical principle
based on observation of attested usage and theorization of a virtual model.

#### A virtual model of [أَنْ]{.ar} before a-state stateful verbs

We present another example of where virtual modeling is useful for coming up with grammatical principles.
In chapter\ (ref),
we studied how a a-state stateful verb can occur after the particle [لِ]{.ar}.
For example:

<!--
(@) [جِئْتُكَ لِتُكْرِمَنِي]{.ar}  
    [I came for the reason [that] you honor me.]{.trans}  
-->

(@) [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
    [I studied for the reason [that] I may succeed.]{.trans}  

The particle [لِ]{.ar} here signifies the meaning
[for the reason]{.trans}.

The grammarians theorized that
between the
[لِ]{.ar}
and the
a-state stateful
[أَنْجَحَ]{.ar},
there existed a virtually modeled [أَنْ]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [دَرَسْتُ لِ[أَنْ] أَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
    [I studied for the reason [that] I may succeed.]{.trans}  

And it was this [أَنْ]{.ar} that actually caused the stateful verb to be in the a-state.
This virtual modeling
allowed them to
reduce the definition of
[لِ]{.ar}
to a preposition that only precedes nouns.
And it granted to [أَنْ]{.ar} the (more-or-less) sole privilege of causing a stateful verb to be in the a-state.^[Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 186--189]

The virtual modeling of [أَنْ]{.ar}
between
[لِ]{.ar}
and a following a-state stateful verb is also supported by the fact that
the surface speech can actually have an [أَنْ]{.ar} in that position, for the same meaning.
So we can actually also say:

(@) [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْ أَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
    [I studied for the reason that I may succeed.]{.trans}  

As for the restriction of
[لِ]{.ar}
to a preposition that only precedes nouns,
then this can be seen when we apply a second level of virtual modeling:
and that is to interpret (a surface or virtually modeled)
[أَنْ]{.ar} and the following a-state stateful verb as a [maSdar]{.trn2} construction.
So the virtual model of () [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْ أَنْجَحَ]{.ar}
is:

(@) [دَرَسْتُ لِنَجَاحِي]{.ar}  
    [I studied for the reason of my success.]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [in order to achieve success]{.trans}.)  

In the virtual model in example (),
we can see how
[لِ]{.ar}
is a preposition before the i-state noun
[نَجَاح]{.ar}.

We will see more examples of virtual modeling for the a-state stateful verb in chapter\ (ref), if Allāh wills.

#### A virtual model of a warning statement

[إِيَّاكَ وَالشَّرَّ]{.ar}

TODO. Get from [[شرح ابن عثيمين]{.ar} 59/4](https://shamela.ws/book/36954/636)

### Some aspects regarding virtual modeling

#### The virtual model is not actually uttered

One point to note,
regarding virtual modeling,
is that 
the virtual model representation of a surface speech is often not actually correct as surface speech.^[Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 190; Versteegh, "The notion of underlying levels" 278]

If we take the virtual model in () [ذَهَبَ [هُوَ]]{.ar} as an example,
then what we mean is that
we don't actually say (in surface speech)
[ذَهَبَ هُوَ]{.ar}
when we intend to mean [He went]{.trans}.
The surface speech () [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} is the only correct way to express this intended meaning.
The representation [ذَهَبَ [هُوَ]]{.ar}
is only a _virtual model_ of the surface speech [ذَهَبَ]{.ar}
that elucidates the grammar of the sentence.

Sometimes,
however,
a virtual model representation is actually correct as surface speech,
for more-or-less the same,
or a similar meaning.
This can be,
for example,
when the virtual model restores a word or expression which is implied and was optionally deleted.
For example,
we saw that
the virtually modeled [أَنْ]{.ar} in example () [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْجَحَ]{.ar}
can actually be expressed in surface speech, thus:

(@) [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْ أَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
    [I studied for the reason that I may succeed.]{.trans}  

By the way,
coincidentally,
[ذَهَبَ هُوَ]{.ar}
is actually a correct sentence
in its own right,
but it has a different meaning than the intended
[ذَهَبَ]{.ar}
[He went]{.trans}.
It uses the pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} as an _emphatic follower_ (see chapter\ (ref)).

#### The literal representation used in the virtual model may not be real

Another point
is that the virtually modeled doers,
([[هُوَ]{.ar}],
[[هِيَ]{.ar}],
[[أَنَا]{.ar}],
and
[[نَحْنُ]{.ar}]
in examples () through () above)
are not "real" representations of the latent doer pronouns.
They are only written as such because,
for his analysis,
the grammarian needs some words to represent the
latent doer pronouns in the virtual model.
And because there are no real words to denote the latent doer pronouns,
the grammarian borrows the words that denote the detached pronouns to do so.

As it happens,
the virtually modeled latent pronouns are theorized to be (invisible) attached pronouns,^[[الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي]{.ar}, [تمهيد ز--ط]{.ar}]
just like the overt doer pronouns
[تُ]{.ar} [I]{.trans},
[نَا]{.ar} [we]{.trans},
[نَ]{.ar} [they~3f~]{.trans},
etc.
Virtually modeling the latent doer pronouns
as attached pronouns has benefits that keeps the grammatical framework coherent
across different grammatical topics.
We will see one such benefit in chapter\ (ref), when we discuss the emphatic follower.

#### Virtual modeling may be required to correctly interpret a text

Consider the following [Ayah]{.trn2} from the Qurʾān:

(@) [وَجَاۤءُو عَلَىٰ قَمِیصِهِۦ بِدَمࣲ كَذِبࣲۚ قَالَ بَلۡ سَوَّلَتۡ لَكُمۡ أَنفُسُكُمۡ أَمۡرࣰاۖ **فَصَبۡرࣱ جَمِیلࣱۖ** وَٱللَّهُ ٱلۡمُسۡتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ]{.quran}
    [[[سورة يوسف]{.ar} 12:18](https://quran.com/12/18)]{.citex}  
    [And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allāh is the one sought for help against that which you describe."]{.trans}

The part
[صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ]{.ar}
has been analyzed
as being able to be bear multiple interpretations,
all requiring virtual modeling.
One analysis is that
[صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ]{.ar}
is a subject whose info is deleted.
The virtual model for this analysis is:

The second analysis is that
[صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ]{.ar}
is a info whose subject is deleted.
The virtual model for this analysis is:

    [[[الدر المصون للسمين الحلبي]{.ar}](https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/12/18) for [سورة يوسف]{.ar} 12:18]{.citex}  
    [My affair is a beautiful patience.]{.trans}  

A third analysis is that
[صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ]{.ar}
is used as a deputy to a verb (see section\ (maf3ool mutlaq))
in a command to oneself.
The virtual model for this analysis is:

(@) [اصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا]{.ar}
    [[[تفسير ابن عاشور]{.ar}](https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/12/18) for [سورة يوسف]{.ar} 12:18]{.citex}  
    [Be patient [with] a beautiful patience!]{.trans}  

#### Virtual modeling can be used to interpret anomalous usage

Grammarians also sometimes used virtual modeling as a tool to make anomalous usage
fit coherently
into their grammatical framework.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 42]
For example, if we consider the line of poetry that we discussed in section\ (ref) above:

(@) [جَارِيَةٌ فِي دِرْعِهَا الفَضْفَاضِ ~ **أَبْيَضُ** مِنْ أُخْتِ بَنِي إِبَاضِ]{.ar}
    [[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 42]{.citex}  
    [A girl in her full long shirt ~ **whiter** than a [woman of the tribe] of [#banU #ibAD]{.trn2}]{.trans}  

[أَبْيَض]{.ar}
when taken to mean [whiter]{.trans} is anomalous usage, as we have mentioned.
One attempt to make it fit into the grammarians' analogy-based rules is by
interpreting
[أَبْيَض]{.ar}
not as a comparative noun,
but as a adjectival noun
synonymous to [مُبْيَضَّ]{.ar} [white]{.trans}.
An implied noun [جَسَد]{.ar} [body]{.trans} is also inserted.^[[[الإنصاف للأنباري]{.ar} 1/123](https://shamela.ws/book/7362/119#p1)]
Such that the virtual model is:

(@) [فِي دِرْعِهَا جَسَدٌ مُبْيَضٌّ مِنْ أُخْتِ بَنِي إِبَاضِ]{.ar}
    [[[الإنصاف للأنباري]{.ar} 1/123](https://shamela.ws/book/7362/119#p1)]{.citex}  
    [... in her shirt is a white body from [a woman of the tribe] of [#banU #ibAD]{.trn2}]{.trans}  

Needless to say, this is pretty convoluted virtual modeling.
Some grammarians would prefer to let such anomalous usage be,
and they wouldn't attempt to force such complicated virtual modeling
to make the anomalous usage fit into their
analogy-based
grammatical system.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 42  
Here is another example of using virtual modeling with anomalous usage:  
[ولا يتقدم نعت المصدر على معموله فلا يقال عرفت سوقك العنيف الإبل، لأن معمول المصدر منه بمنزلة الصلة من الموصول، فلا يتقدم نعت المصدر على معموله، كما لا يتقدم نعت الموصول على صلته، فإن ورد ما يوهم خلاف ذلك قدر فعل بعد النعت يتعلق به المعمول المتأخر. فمن ذلك قول الحطيئة:  
أزمَعْتُ يأسًا مُبِينا من نَوالكم ~ ولنْ ترى طارِدًا للحُرِّ كاليأسِ  
فالمتبادر إلى فهم سامع هذا البيت تعليق من نوالكم بيأسا، وهو غير جائز كما ذكرت، بل يتعلق بيئست مضمرا]{.ar}  
[[[شرح التسهيل لابن مالك]{.ar} 3/108--109](https://shamela.ws/book/13257/924#p1)]{.citex}]

#### There can be multiple 'levels' of virtual modeling

In order to fit a surface speech into analogy,
there can be multiple 'levels' of virtual modeling done.
As an example,
we saw in section\ (ref) above that
in the sentence () [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْجَحَ]{.ar},
first an [أَنْ]{.ar} was virtually modeled between
[لِ]{.ar}
and the
a-state stateful thus: () [دَرَسْتُ لِأَنْ أَنْجَحَ]{.ar}.

And then a further level of virtual modeling was done,
where
[أَنْ]{.ar} and the following a-state stateful verb
was reinterpreted
as a [maSdar]{.trn2} construction: () [دَرَسْتُ لِنَجَاحِي]{.ar}.

Sometimes a virtual model mainly details the meaning of a sentence,
rather than its syntactic structure.
At all layers, however,
virtual modeling serves to explain the grammar of the sentence.

### Benefits and risks of virtual modeling

Virtual modeling is an analytic tool that allows the grammarian to discover
and reconstruct
a theorized structure that underlies surface speech.^[Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 188]
This theorized underlying structure is more basic than the surface structure,
and more easily described with a set of rules.^[Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 190]
Without
virtual modeling,
the set of rules, which the grammarian would have to formulate,
would increase greatly to capture all the different variations in surface speech.
Furthermore, the rules would be disparate,
and would not readily indicate the links
between related linguistic phenomena.
Those links are more obvious in the virtual model.

Having said that,
virtual modeling is essentially a speculative exercise which is done by the grammarian.
Because
the virtual model,
by its very definition,
does not manifest in surface speech,
the grammarian can only theorize its existence and formulation.
As such, virtual modeling entails risks because it is based on the grammarian's
subjective reasoning.^[Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 190]

Therefore, the grammarian does,
or should,
attempt to validate his virtual modeling approach,
to whatever degree possible.
One way to do this is
by basing the virtual model on
the meaning that
a native speaker understands from the surface speech,
like our hypothetical grammarian did for latent doer pronouns in section\ (ref) above.

Another way is to attempt to find traces of the virtual model in the surface speech,
as was done in section\ (ref) above,
for the virtual modeling of [أَنْ]{.ar} between
[لِ]{.ar}
and a following a-state stateful verb.

At the very least, any virtual model should be subservient to, and not contradict,
the intended meaning of the surface speech.^[See also Baalbaki, "Bāb al-fāʾ" 188]

## Difference of opinion between the grammarians

The grammarians sometimes differed with one another
regarding the extraction of analogy-based rules from attested usage.
We have seen a couple of examples of their differences in the sections above.
These differences often,
though not always,
occur along grammatical school lines,
with the
[#baSr]{.trn2}ans having one opinion,
and the
[#kUf]{.trn2}ans another.^[See Baalbaki, Introduction to _The early Islamic grammatical tradition_, §"The Basran/Kufan divide", pp.\ xxxix--xlii] 
Sometimes, the difference is more in terminology than anything else.
For example,
the [#baSr]{.trn2}ans in their definition of the _doer_,
mandated that the doer can only occur after the verb in word order.
The [#kUf]{.trn2}ans on the other hand allowed the doer to occur before the verb.
However, both schools allowed sentences like:

(@) [زَيْدٌ جَاءَ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd came.]{.trans}  

It's just that the [#kUf]{.trn2}ans would analyze
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} as a doer,
whereas the [#baSr]{.trn2}ans would analyze it as a subject.^[[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/45](https://shamela.ws/book/17801/428)]

Some more differences between the two schools are that
the [#kUf]{.trn2}ans are considered to be more lax in extending analogy-based rules
from anomalous usage.
Whereas the [#baSr]{.trn2}ans liked to keep their rules more taut.
And they would often attempt to interpret anomalous usage through virtual modeling
so that it aligned with their rules.^[[القياس في اللغة العربية لمحمد الخضر حسين]{.ar} 41--42]
Both, however, as a general rule, accepted the anomalous usage as valid attested usage.

The [#kUf]{.trn2}ans are also thought to be more grounded in that they tried to stay
closer to attested usage^[[[التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان]{.ar} 11/75](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/3610)]
rather than venturing into too much virtual modeling.

Generally speaking,
the [#baSr]{.trn2}ans formed their terminology and opinions
with a view to building a comprehensive and coherent grammatical system.
And it is their terminology and opinions that became the standard among later grammarians.
Nevertheless,
the [#kUf]{.trn2}an view is often brought in as a reality check against
what may sometimes be deemed to be excessive
rule strictness
and
virtual modeling
on the part of the [#baSr]{.trn2}ans.
