# The noun
<!-- title not called "Common nouns" because concepts are general to all nouns. However, only common nouns are discussed here.-->
## Introduction

A noun is a kind of word that is the name of something or someone.

Here are some examples of common nouns in Arabic:

Arabic word | Transcription|Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:----------------
[رَجُل]{.ar}  |[rajul]{.trn}     |man
[كِتَاب]{.ar} |[kitAb]{.trn}     |book
[بَيْت]{.ar}  |[bayt]{.trn}      |house
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} |[cajarah]{.trn}   |tree
[صَبْر]{.ar}  |[Sabr]{.trn}      |patience
[وَقْت]{.ar}  |[waqt]{.trn}      |time
[طَعَام]{.ar} |[TaeAm]{.trn}     |food
[ٱِبْن]{.ar}  |[Eibn]{.trn}      |son

Note that the final letter in each word, above, does not have a vowel mark. This is because, the final vowel mark is actually variable, as we shall see later in this chapter.

When we discuss nouns outside of sentences we shall pronounce the [ة]{.ar} as a [h]{.trn}. Therefore, 
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} "tree", in isolation, is pronounced [cajarah]{.trn}, not [cajarat]{.trn}.

Some nouns begin with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}, for example: [ٱِبْن]{.ar} [Eibn]{.trn} "son". When in the beginning of a sentence, the connecting [hamzah]{.trn2} will be pronounced with an [imark]{.subs} [◌ِ]{.ar}.

## Definiteness

When talking about nouns it is necessary to introduce a topic called _definiteness_.

A noun is _definite_ when the person or thing it refers to is known. For example, if you say, "The man arrived." then the usage of the word "the" before "man" tells us that the man is known to us. Therefore the noun "man" is definite in this sentence.

Conversely, if we had said "A man arrived." then the use of "a" before "man" tells us that the man is unknown to us. Therefore "man" is indefinite in this sentence.

"The" is called the _definite article_ and "a" is called the _indefinite article_.

### Definite nouns in Arabic

The definite article in Arabic is 
[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. It corresponds to the English definite article "the".
In order to make a noun definite, we attach 
[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}
to its beginning.

For example, the definite noun "the book" in Arabic is [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [EalkitAb]{.trn}.

[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}
begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}; the [hamzah]{.trn2} will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence. And when it occurs in the beginning of a sentence, the [hamzah]{.trn2} is pronounced with a [◌َ]{.ar} a-mark.

#### Sun letters and moon letters

The noun “man” in Arabic is [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn}. To make this noun definite, we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} to the beginning of the word. But instead of becoming [ٱَلْرَجُل]{.ar} [Ealrajul]{.trn} the word becomes [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [Earrajul]{.trn}. The [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the [ر]{.ar} gets doubled. This happens because the first letter [ر]{.ar} in the word [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} is from a group of letters called "sun letters". For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} is put in the beginning, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.

The rest of the letters in the alphabet are called "moon letters" and for words that begin with moon letters, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, [ك]{.ar} is a moon letter and we have already seen that [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "book" becomes [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [EalkitAb]{.trn} "the book".

The sun letters are [ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن]{.ar}.  
The moon letters are [ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي]{.ar}.

The names "sun letters" and "moon letters" were given because of the Arabic words for "sun" and "moon" respectively. "The sun" in Arabic is [ٱَلشَّمْس]{.ar} [Eaccams]{.trn} which begins with [ش]{.ar} which causes the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. "The moon" is [ٱَلْقَمَر]{.ar} [Ealqamar]{.trn} which begins with [ق]{.ar} which does not cause the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. Thus [ش]{.ar} represents the sun letters and [ق]{.ar} represents the moon letters.

Here are some examples of words that begin with sun letters:

Noun | Definite noun
:-----------|:-----------
[رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} "man" | [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [Earrajul]{.trn} "the man"  
[تَاجِر]{.ar} [tAjir]{.trn} "trader" | [ٱَلتَّاجِر]{.ar} [EattAjir]{.trn} "the trader"  
[لُعْبَة]{.ar} [luebah]{.trn} "toy" | [ٱَللُّعْبَة]{.ar} [Ealluebah]{.trn} "the toy"  

#### The definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} with nouns with an initial connecting [hamzah]{.trn2} {#the-definite-article-with-nouns-with-an-initial-connecting-hamzah}

If the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} is with prefixed to nouns that have an initial connecting [hamzah]{.trn2}, then the [ل]{.ar} shall no longer have an [0mark]{.subs} [◌ْ]{.ar}. Instead it shall have an [imark]{.subs} [◌ِ]{.ar}. Example:

[ٱَلِٱبْن]{.ar}  
[Eali-bn]{.trn}  
"the son"

### Indefinite nouns in Arabic

Arabic has no indefinite article corresponding to the English indefinite article "a". In order to make a noun indefinite in Arabic, it is simply written or pronounced without the definite article
[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}.
For example, [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book".

<!--For convenience, outside of sentences, we may simply translate [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} as "book" instead of "a book".-->

### Differences in definiteness between Arabic and English

The articles "a" and "the" are types of words called _determiners_. Besides "a" and "the", English has other determiners like "some", "this", "that", etc. that can make a noun definite or indefinite.
For example:

"This man gave that boy some food."

In the above sentence "man" and "boy" are definite, and "food" is indefinite.

English can also have definite or indefinite nouns without determiners. The definiteness of the noun is then determined by the meaning of the sentence. Consider, for example, the sentence:

"Time is valuable."

Here, we are not talking about some indefinite amount of time, but rather the general concept of time, which is known to us. Therefore, the noun "time" here is definite.

Consider now the sentence:

"We don't have to leave just yet; we have time."

Here, "time" has an indefinite meaning "[some] time".
<!--
This English usage of an indefinite meaning without an indefnite article is especially true with plurals. For example, "There are books in the bag." Here the intended meaning is "There are [some] books in the bag." Consequently, in Arabic, we will use the indefinite noun here: [كُتُب]{.ar} [kutub]{.trn} "[some] books" not [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

However, there are times when English uses a plural without a definite or indefinite article, and a general meaning is intended. For example, "Books contain knowledge." In this case, in Arabic we will use the definite noun [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".
-->

As opposed to this complicated situation in English, Arabic uses only the definite article
[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}
to make common nouns definite.
So when translating sentences from English to Arabic, you must first determine whether the noun is definite or not in English, and then use 
[ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}
when the noun is definite.

Examples:

+ "This man gave that boy some food."
  + man: definite; Arabic: [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [Earrujul]{.trn}
  + boy: definite; Arabic: [ٱَلْغُلَام]{.ar} [EalgulAm]{.trn}
  + food: indefinite; Arabic: [طَعَام]{.ar} [TaeAm]{.trn}

+ "Time is valuable."
  + time: definite; Arabic: [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn}

+ "We don't have to leave just yet; we have time."
  + time: indefinite; Arabic: [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn}

## State

Nouns in Arabic have a property called _state_.
The state of a noun is dependent on the function of the noun in a sentence.
The state of a noun is indicated by the noun's ending. 
There are three states that a noun can be in.
They are:
<!--You may think of the grammatical states of nouns like the physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. The same water can be in a solid ice state, or a liquid water state, or a gaseous water vapour state. Similarly, the same noun, in Arabic, may be in one of the three grammatical states:

1. [ustate]{.subs}: indicated by a [umark]{.subs} [◌ُ]{.ar} (for definite nouns) and a [tanwin]{.subs}ed [umark]{.subs} [◌ٌ]{.ar} (for indefinite nouns) on the final letter of the word.
2. [astate]{.subs}: indicated by an [amark]{.subs} [◌َ]{.ar} (for definite nouns) and a [tanwin]{.subs}ed [amark]{.subs} [◌ً]{.ar} (for indefinite nouns) on the final letter of the word.
3. [istate]{.subs}: indicated by an [imark]{.subs} [◌ِ]{.ar} (for definite nouns) and a [tanwin]{.subs}ed [imark]{.subs} [◌ٍ]{.ar} (for indefinite nouns) on the final letter of the word.
-->

1. the [ustate]{.subs}, indicated, for most nouns, by a [umark]{.subs} on the final letter of the noun.
1. the [astate]{.subs}, indicated, for most nouns, by a [amark]{.subs} on the final letter of the noun.
1. the [istate]{.subs}, indicated, for most nouns, by a [imark]{.subs} on the final letter of the noun.

When a noun is indefinite, then, for most nouns, it<!--s final (state-indicating) vowel--> is also [tanwin]{.subs}ed.
Here, for example, is the noun [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "book" in its three states:

State         | Indefinite "a book" | Definite "the book"
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
[ustate]{.subs}       |[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [EalkitAbu]{.trn} 
[astate]{.subs}       |[كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} |[ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [EalkitAba]{.trn} 
[istate]{.subs}       |[كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [EalkitAbi]{.trn} 

The [ustate]{.subs} is a noun's normal state in a sentence, and there needs to be a reason to take the noun out of this state into another state.
We will begin to use state more in the next chapter if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, where we learn how to form sentences.

<!--
## Flexibility of nouns

Most nouns behave as described above: their endings change with their state. These nouns are called _flexible_ nouns. In later chapters, we will learn about some nouns whose endings only partially change, or don't change at all, with their state. They will be called _semi-flexible_ nouns and _rigid_ nouns respectively.
-->
<!--
Don't use because english uses different words, not modifying the ending of the same word:
By the way, some English words have state too: the words The words "he" and "him" refer to the same person. But sometimes we will use "he" and sometimes we will use "him", depending on the function of the word in the sentence. For example,

+ "He talked to the man." The word "he" is used here because it is the [mubtada]{.subs}.
+ "The man gave the book to him." The word "him" is used here because it comes after the preposition "to".

In English grammar, _state_ is called _case_ instead. The above examples in English may help you in understanding the concept of _state_ in Arabic.
-->
<!--
## Usage of definite and indefinite nouns

Consider the noun "time". In English we can make this noun definite using the definite article "the", for example, "The time to act is now." When translating this sentence to Arabic, we will correspondingly use the definite noun: [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".

In English, we can make "time" indefinite using indefinite articles like "a" or "some". For example, "There is a time for work and a time for play." and "We have some time before we need to leave." When translating these sentences to Arabic we will correspondingly use the indefinite noun in both these sentences: [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".

Consider now a third scenario: in English we can also use the word "time" with a general meaning without a definite or indefinite article. For example, "Time is money." However, in Arabic, a noun must be either definite or indefinite. So we must choose between [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time" and [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time". In Arabic, [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn}, being indefinite, can only mean "a time" or "some time". So [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} is then used when we wish to say "time" with a general meaning. This means that, in Arabic the definite noun is used in two ways: 

i. When the definite meaning is desired. For example, "We met at the time we had agreed upon." (Use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)
ii. When a general meaning is desired. For example, "There is nothing more valuable than time." (Again, use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)

Conversely, the indefinite nouns is used only when an indefinite meaning is desired. For example, "We agreed to meet at a certain time."(Use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".)

In a similar manner, the nouns "home" or "school" are often used in English without either "the" or "a". For example, "He goes to school." and "She went home.". In these cases, we will us the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in Arabic. So we will say [ٱَلْبَيْت]{.ar} [Ealbayt]{.trn} "the home" for English "home" and [ٱَلْمَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [Ealmadrasah]{.trn} "the school" for English "school".

But there is an additional complication: note that English often does not use an indefinte article, even when an indefinite meaning is intended. For example, "We don't need to leave right now; we have time." meaning "we have [#some_] time." Because of the indefinite meaning intended we will use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time" here.

This English usage of an indefinite meaning without an indefnite article is especially true with plurals. For example, "There are books in the bag." Here the intended meaning is "There are [some] books in the bag." Consequently, in Arabic, we will use the indefinite noun here: [كُتُب]{.ar} [kutub]{.trn} "[some] books" not [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

However, there are times when English uses a plural without a definite or indefinite article, and a general meaning is intended. For example, "Books contain knowledge." In this case, in Arabic we will use the definite noun [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

This topic may be a little difficult to comprehend right now because we have not yet learned how to form sentences. Later, you may refer back to this section as needed.

## Grammatical gender

Some nouns designate animate beings like "man", "woman", "boy", "girl", "dog", "cow", etc.
Other nouns designate inanimate objects like "book", "house", "hand", "tree", "city", "food". 

In dealing with the grammatical genders of such nouns, English uses three genders:

1. The masculine gender. This is used for nouns that designate male human beings and also some male animals. The pronouns used for the masculine gender are "he", "him", and "his".
2. The feminine gender. This is used for nouns that designate female human beings, and also some female animals. The pronouns used for the feminine gender are "she" and "her".
3. The neutral gender. This is used for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals in general. The pronoun used for the neutral gender is "it".

In Arabic, there are only two grammatical genders: the masculine gender and the feminine gender.
All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. 
Nouns that designate male human beings are assigned the masculine grammatical gender. And
nouns that designate female human beings are assigned the feminine grammatical gender.
Nouns that designate animals sometimes conform to the gender of the animal.
Other times, they have a fixed gender.
As for nouns that designate inanimate objects, these, too, are assigned a gender. For example, [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "book" in Arabic is masculine. And [شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} "tree" in Arabic is feminine.
We shall discuss this in more detail below.

### Nouns that designate animate beings.

In Arabic, in terms of their form, nouns that designate animate beings are in three categories:

1. There are separate but matching nouns for the male and female animate beings.
2. There are separate and unrelated nouns for the male and female animate beings.
3. The same noun is used for both sexes.

We will discuss each of these categories below.

#### Matching nouns for male and female animate beings

In Arabic for some nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for both sexes match each other. Here are some examples:
<!--
[فَتًى]{.ar}    [fatA]{.trn}      |masc.|a young man
[فَتَاة]{.ar}   [fatAh]{.trn}     |fem. |a young woman
-->

##### Primitive nouns {-}

Arabic word |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[ٱِبْن]{.ar}    [Eibn]{.trn}      |masc.|son
[ٱِبْنَة]{.ar}   [Eibnah]{.trn}    |fem. |daughter
[طِفْل]{.ar}    [Tifl]{.trn}      |masc.|child
[طِفْلَة]{.ar}   [Tiflah]{.trn}    |fem. |(female) child
[إِنْسَان]{.ar}  [EinsAn]{.trn}    |masc.|human being
[إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn}  |fem. |(female) human being
[حُرّ]{.ar}     [Hurr]{.trn}      |masc.|free man
[حُرَّة]{.ar}    [Hurrah]{.trn}    |fem. |free woman
[كَلْب]{.ar}    [kalb]{.trn}      |masc.|(male) dog
[كَلْبَة]{.ar}   [kalbah]{.trn}    |fem. |(female) dog
[هِرّ]{.ar}     [hirr]{.trn}      |masc.|(male) cat
[هِرَّة]{.ar}    [hirrah]{.trn}    |fem. |(female) cat

##### Derived nouns {-}

Arabic word |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[مُعَلِّم]{.ar}   [mueallim]{.trn}  |masc.|(male) teacher
[مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar}  [mueallimah]{.trn}|fem. |(female) teacher
[طَالِب]{.ar}   [TAlib]{.trn}     |masc.|(male) student
[طَالِبَة]{.ar}  [TAlibah]{.trn}   |fem. |(female) student
[صَاحِب]{.ar}   [SAHib]{.trn}     |masc.|(male) companion
[صَاحِبَة]{.ar}  [SAHibah]{.trn}   |fem. |(female) companion
[صَدِيق]{.ar}   [SadIq]{.trn}     |masc.|(male) friend
[صَدِيقَة]{.ar}  [SadIqah]{.trn}   |fem. |(female) friend 

In each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is basically the same as the masculine noun but with the addition of a [ة]{.ar} at the end. For example,
[طِفْل]{.ar}  [Tifl]{.trn} is masculine, and its feminine is
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn} (fem.).

As a matter of fact, the [ة]{.ar} is called a feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other, less common, feminine markers besides [ة]{.ar} that we will learn them later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.
 
Note that the vowel-mark before the [ة]{.ar} is always an [amark]{.subs}. 
<!--For example, in the case of [كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} "a male dog", in order to get the feminine noun [كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbatun]{.trn} "a female dog", [ب]{.ar} gets an [amark]{.subs}.-->

Note also that we have divided the nouns above into two categories:

 i. Primitive nouns
ii. Derived nouns

Primitve nouns have a primitive meaning, without a primarily adjectival or verbal quality in the meaning, for example "human" "cat", etc. 
For derived nouns, their meaning is derived from an adjectival or verbal quality. For example, a "teacher" is someone who teaches. A "friend" is someone who is friendly. And so on.

<!--This grouping will become important when, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, you study morphology, and the classification of nouns into primitive and derived nouns. But we can give a short preview here: -->

For derived nouns, the formation of the feminine noun by adding a feminine marker (like [ة]{.ar}) to the masculine noun is normal and expected. 
Whereas, for primitive nouns, the fact that the feminine and masuline nouns match each other and differ only by the feminine marker [ة]{.ar} is something that, although somewhat common, is more of a coincidence.

Another noteworthy point is that, for many primitive nouns, sometimes only one of the masculine/feminine pair may be used to refer to beings of either sex. What we mean by this is that, for example,
[كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn}, while remaining a masculine noun, can be used to refer to both a male dog and a female dog, especially if the animal's physical gender is not obvious or particularly important.
And [كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female dog" is typically only used when it is needed to specify the gender of the animal.
Conversely, [هِرَّة]{.ar} [hirrah]{.trn} "a (female) cat" may be used to refer to cat of either physical gender, especially if it is not obvious whether it is a male or female cat.

This preference of the noun of one gender to refer to beings of either physical gender is case-by-case. For example,
[طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn} (masc.) is commonly used to say "a child", regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl. But [طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn}, although not uncommon, is used specifically for "a female child".

As another example, the word [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female human being" is rarely used at all. Instead, the word
[إِنْسَان]{.ar} [EinsAn]{.trn}, while remaining a masculine noun, is almost always used to refer to "a human being" in general, regardless of actual gender.

On the other hand,
<!--[فَتًى]{.ar}    [fatA]{.trn} "a young man"
[فَتَاة]{.ar}   [fatAh]{.trn} "a young woman"-->
[ٱِبْن]{.ar}    [Eibn]{.trn}      "son" and
[ٱِبْنَة]{.ar}   [Eibnah]{.trn}    "daughter"
are only ever used for their respective gender. So 
[ٱِبْن]{.ar}    [Eibn]{.trn}   (masc.) "a son" is never used to mean "a daughter".
And [ٱِبْنَة]{.ar}   [Eibnah]{.trn}    (fem.) "a daughter" is never used to mean "a son".
<!--[فَتًى]{.ar}    [fatA]{.trn} is never used to refer to "a young woman".-->

<!--There aren't very many of such nouns. And we have covered a few of the common ones above. A good dictionary will also provide guidance in this regard.-->

As for derived nouns,
they are typically only ever used for their respective gender. So, for example,
[مُعَلِّم]{.ar}   [mueallim]{.trn}  (masc.) is only used for "a (male) teacher". And
[مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar}  [mueallimah]{.trn} (fem.) is only used for "a (female) teacher".

<!--is used commonly for "a dog" and [هِرَّة]{.ar} [hirrah]{.trn} (fem.) may be used for "a cat".

Even though the male and female animate beings have separate words, sometimes one of the words is used commonly two refer to both sexes. This is especially common when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence. For example,
[كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} (masc.) is used commonly for "a dog" and [هِرَّة]{.ar} [hirrah]{.trn} (fem.) may be used for "a cat".
Similarly, [طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn} (masc.) is commonly used to say "a child", regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl. This is done when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence, as, for example, in the sentence: "A child entered.".

In fact, the word [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female human being" is rarely used at all. Instead, the word
[إِنْسَان]{.ar} [EinsAn]{.trn} (masc.) is used to refer to "a human being" in general, regardless of actual gender.-->

#### Unrelated nouns for male and female animate beings

For other nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for the male and female sexes are completely unrelated. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[أَب]{.ar}    [Eab]{.trn}     |masc.|father
[أُمّ]{.ar}    [Eumm]{.trn}    |fem. |mother
[غُلَام]{.ar}  [gulAm]{.trn}   |masc.|boy
[جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} |fem. |girl
[عَبْد]{.ar}   [eabd]{.trn}    |masc.|male slave
[أَمَة]{.ar}   [Eamah]{.trn}   |fem. |female slave
[أَسَد]{.ar}   [Easad]{.trn}   |masc.|lion
[لَبْوَة]{.ar}  [labwah]{.trn}  |fem. |lioness
[ثَوْر]{.ar}   [vawr]{.trn}    |masc.|bull
[بَقَرَة]{.ar}  [baqarah]{.trn} |fem. |cow

Even in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a [ة]{.ar} feminine marker. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don't end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}. [أُمّ]{.ar} [Eumm]{.trn} "mother" is one of these exceptions.

#### Using the same noun for both sexes

There are other nouns for animate beings where the same word is used for both sexes. The word itself will still be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[شَخْص]{.ar}   [caxS]{.trn}    |masc.|person
[نَفْس]{.ar}   [nafs]{.trn}    |fem. |self
[عَدُوّ]{.ar}   [eaduww]{.trn}  |masc.|enemy
[حَيَوَان]{.ar} [HayawAn]{.trn} |masc.|animal
[طَائِر]{.ar}  [TAEir]{.trn}   |masc.|bird
[قِرْد]{.ar}   [qird]{.trn}    |masc.|monkey
[حَمَامَة]{.ar} [HamAmah]{.trn} |fem. |dove
[نَمْلَة]{.ar}  [namlah]{.trn}  |fem. |ant

So, for example, [قِرْد]{.ar} [qird]{.trn} "monkey" is grammatically masculine but it will be used for both a male and a female monkey.
Similarly, [شَخْص]{.ar}  [caxS]{.trn} is a masculine noun meaning "person". While remaining grammatically masculine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female persons.
While, [نَفْس]{.ar} [nafs]{.trn} is a feminine noun meaning "self". While remaining grammatically feminine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female selves

Note also that [نَفْس]{.ar} [nafs]{.trn} "self" is a feminine noun but it does not end in a [ة]{.ar}. 
It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that don't have a female marker, like [أُمّ]{.ar} [Eumm]{.trn} (fem.) "mother".

<!--Notably, [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn} is treated as feminine when it refers to the soul of a person. However, in constructions like "yourself", "himself", etc. it will conform to the gender of the person it is referring to. We shall see this in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.-->

### Nouns that designate inanimate objects

As mentioned earlier, nouns that designate inanimate objects are assigned a fixed grammatical gender. There is usually no discernable reason why some are assigned a masculine gender while others are assigned a feminine gender.

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[كِتَاب]{.ar}  [kitAb]{.trn}   |masc.|book
[بَيْت]{.ar}   [bayt]{.trn}    |masc.|house
[قَلَم]{.ar}   [qalam]{.trn}   |masc.|pen
[طَعَام]{.ar}  [TaeAm]{.trn}   |masc.|food
[مَاء]{.ar}   [mAE]{.trn}     |masc.|water
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn}|fem. |school
[مَدِينَة]{.ar} [madInah]{.trn} |fem. |city
[غُرْفَة]{.ar}  [gurfah]{.trn}  |fem. |room
[شَجَرَة]{.ar}  [cajarah]{.trn} |fem. |tree
[شَمْس]{.ar}   [cams]{.trn}    |fem. |sun
[قَمَر]{.ar}   [qamar]{.trn}   |masc.|moon
[عِلْم]{.ar}   [eilm]{.trn}    |masc.|knowledge
[قُوَّة]{.ar}   [quwwah]{.trn}  |fem. |strength
[حَيَاة]{.ar}  [HayAh]{.trn}   |fem. |life
[مَوْت]{.ar}   [mawt]{.trn}    |masc.|death

In these nouns as well, we note that feminine nouns usually end with the feminine marker [ة]{.ar}. 
But here too, we find another exception:
[شَمْس]{.ar} [cams]{.trn} "sun" which is feminine but does not end with a feminine marker.
These exceptions are not very many and, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, we will not find it hard to memorize them.

There is a sub-group of nouns that designate inanimate objects, but can also be used to refer to animate beings. Here are a couple of examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[رَهِينَة]{.ar} [rahInah]{.trn} |fem. |pledge
[عُضْو]{.ar}   [euDw]{.trn}    |masc.|member

[رَهِينَة]{.ar} [rahInah]{.trn} is a feminine noun meaning "pledge". For inanimate objects it refers to something that is held as a security or a collateral. With its animate meaning, it is used to refer to a human hostage.

Similarly,
[عُضْو]{.ar}   [euDw]{.trn} is a masculine noun meaning "member". For inanimate objects it refers to a limb which is the member of a body. With its animate meaning it refers to a person who is a member of a professional organization.

Just like we saw for the nouns in section\ @using-the-same-noun-for-both-sexes,
such nouns adhere to their fixed grammatical gender when used for either male or female persons.

### Nouns with mismarked gender

We saw that there are some nouns that are feminine, but do not end with with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}. These were:

+ [أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    (fem.) "mother"
+ [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn}    (fem.) "self"
+ [شَمْس]{.ar}  [cams]{.trn}    (fem.) "sun"

There are a few more nouns that are like this. One special category among them is body parts. Many prominent body parts that come in pairs or more, are grammatically feminine, whether or not they end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}. Here are some examples:

<!--Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:------------------>

+ [يَد]{.ar} [yad]{.trn} (fem.) "hand" (sometimes "an arm")
+ [عَيْن]{.ar} [eayn]{.trn} (fem.) "eye"
+ [أُذُن]{.ar} [Eupun]{.trn} (fem.) "ear"
+ [قَدَم]{.ar} [qadam]{.trn} (fem.) "foot"
+ [رِجْل]{.ar} [rijl]{.trn} (fem.) "leg" (sometimes "foot")
+ [إِبْهَام]{.ar} [EibhAm]{.trn} (fem.) "thumb"
+ [إِصْبَع]{.ar} [EiSbae]{.trn} (fem.) "finger, toe"
+ [سِنّ]{.ar} [sinn]{.trn} (fem.) "tooth"
+ [رُكْبَة]{.ar} [rukbah]{.trn} (fem.) "knee"

There are exceptions, however. The following body parts come in pairs yet are masculine.

+ [مَنْخَر]{.ar} [manxar]{.trn} (masc.) "nostril"
+ [مِرْفَق]{.ar} [mirfaq]{.trn} (masc.) "elbow"

There are other such exceptions as well.

<!--For other body parts, the grammatical gender conforms to whether it has a feminine marker or not. Examples:-->
Body parts that don't come in pairs are typically more regular in their gender: they are feminine if they end in a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}, and masculine if they don't. Examples:

+ [رَأْس]{.ar} [raEs]{.trn} (masc.) "head"
+ [أَنْف]{.ar} [Eanf]{.trn} (masc.) "nose"
+ [بَطْن]{.ar} [baTn]{.trn} (masc.) "belly"
+ [لِحْيَة]{.ar} [liHyah]{.trn} (fem.) "beard"

Conversely, nouns that end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}, yet are masculine are very rare. Some of the more common of them are:

+ [خَلِيفَة]{.ar} [xalIfah]{.trn} (masc.) "caliph"
+ [عَلَّامَة]{.ar} [eallAmah]{.trn} (masc.) "great scholar"
+ [دَاعِيَة]{.ar} [dAeiyah]{.trn} (masc.) "great preacher"

There are also a few words which can be optionally assigned a masculine or feminine gender. Among these are:

+ [سُوق]{.ar} [sUq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "market"
+ [طَرِيق]{.ar} [TarIq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "path"

A good dictionary should mention the gender of all these exceptional words. In addition, in appendix\ \@ref(unmarked-fem-nouns) as well, we have a compiled a list of feminine nouns that don't end with a feminine marker. (TODO: get from Hava: pg. xi (fem) and xii (admitting either gender).)

## Genderizability

### Non-genderizable nouns

So far, we have only encountered nouns that are not _genderizable_. That is, they are fixed in gender. And we are not allowed to modify their gender. For example, the noun [شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn} is a non-genderizable masculine noun that means "a person". The dictionary tells us that this noun may be applied to both male and female persons. 

Say that we would like to apply this noun to a female person, like [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} (fem.) "a girl", by saying, for example, "The girl is a person.". In order to do this, we are not allowed to feminize the noun [شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn}, by making it [شَخْصَة]{.ar} [caxSah]{.trn} for example. Nor does [شَخْصَة]{.ar} [caxSah]{.trn} pre-exist in the dictionary. So we are forced to apply the masculine noun [شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn} to a female person [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn}. 

This may seem a little unusual because the nouns in this example apply to animate beings that have a physical gender. And so, there is a strong motive to match the grammatical gender of the noun to the physical gender of the being it is applied to. But, as we said, we are prevented from doing so because the noun 
[شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn} is not genderizable.

This mismatch in gender will seem less unusual if we consider nouns that designate inanimate objects. As mentioned earlier, all Arabic nouns, even those that apply to inanimate objects, have a grammatical gender.

Consider, for example, the following nouns:

+ [بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn} (masc.) "a building"
+ [مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn} (fem.) "a school"

Say that we want to make a sentence: "The a building is a school."
There is no problem in applying the feminine noun 
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn} "a school"
to the masculine noun
[بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn} "a building".

Again, we are not allowed to masculinize the feminine noun
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn}
to make it match the masculine noun
[بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn}.
This is because 
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn}
is not a genderizable noun. (So isn't
[بِنَاء]{.ar} [binAE]{.trn}
for that matter.) And this mismatch in gender between the two nouns is perfectly normal.

### Genderizable nouns

There is another class of nouns that are genderizable. This means that we are allowed to modify their gender to match the entity they are applied to. Consider the word:

+ [مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn} (masc.) "a (male) teacher" 

It is an example of a masciline genderizable noun. If we want to use it in the sentence "The father is a teacher.", then it may be applied without modification to the other masculine noun [أَب]{.ar} [Eab]{.trn} (masc.) "a father".

If, however, we want to make the sentence, "The mother is a teacher.", then we first feminine
[مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn} (masc.)
by adding the feminine marker [ة]{.ar}. When we do so, the word becomes:

+ [مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar} [mueallimah]{.trn} (fem.) "a (female) teacher" 

Then we can apply this noun to the other feminine noun [أُمّ]{.ar} [Eumm]{.trn} "a mother".

Here is another example of a genderizable noun:

+ [طَالِب]{.ar} [TAlib]{.trn} (masc.) "a (male) student"

If we wish to apply this noun to a female person, then we feminize it into:

+ [طَالِبَة]{.ar} [TAlibah]{.trn} (masc.) "a (female) student"

### Determining genderizability

There are some nouns that, at first glance, appear genderizable, but actually are not. For example, it may appear as if the noun [طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female child" has been formed by feminizing [طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn} (masc.) "a child". But actually 
[طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn}
and
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn}
are not genderizable words. They both just happen to pre-exist in the dictionary with their respective meanings.

Similar to 
[طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn}
and
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn} are:

+ [إِنْسَان]{.ar} [EinsAn]{.trn}    (masc.) "a human being" and [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female human being"
+ [كَلْب]{.ar}  [kalb]{.trn}      (masc.) "a male dog" and [كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbah]{.trn}    (fem.) "a female dog"
+ [هِرّ]{.ar}   [hirr]{.trn}      (masc.) "a male cat" and [هِرَّة]{.ar}  [hirrah]{.trn}    (fem.) "a female cat"

All of the above are not genderizable nouns.

Here are some general guidelines that can help determine whether a noun is genderizable or not:

1. Most, if not all, nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals are not genderizable.
2. For nouns that designate human beings: 
   a. Those nouns that denote an entity without any verbal or adjectival meaning are usually non-genderizable. Examples:
      + [أَب]{.ar}   [Eab]{.trn}     (masc.) "a father"
      + [أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    (fem.) "a mother"
      + [غُلَام]{.ar} [gulAm]{.trn}   (masc.) "a boy"
      + [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} (fem.) "a girl"
      + [طِفْل]{.ar}    [Tifl]{.trn}      (masc.) "a child"
      + [طِفْلَة]{.ar}   [Tiflah]{.trn}    (fem.) "a female child"
      + [إِنْسَان]{.ar}  [EinsAn]{.trn}    (masc.) "a human being"
      + [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn}  (fem.) "a female human being"
   b. Genderizable nouns will usually have an association with a verbal or adjectival quality. For example:
      + [مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn} (masc.) "a (male) teacher" is one who teaches.
      + [طَالِب]{.ar} [TAlib]{.trn} (masc.) "a (male) student" is one who studies.

Sometimes, it may not be easy to figure out just from the meaning of the noun whether it is genderizable or not. For example, [صَدِيق]{.ar} [SadIq]{.trn} (masc.) "a (male) friend" is genderizable. But [عَدُوّ]{.ar} [eaduww]{.trn} "an enemy" is not genderizable.

As you continue studying, you will, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, get a feel for which nouns are genderizable. And if, at a later advanced stage in your Arabic studies, you study topics like morphology, and classification of nouns into primitive and derived nouns, that will help as well.
