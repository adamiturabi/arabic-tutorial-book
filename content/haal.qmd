# The [hal]{.subs}

## Introduction

The _[hal]{.subs}_ 
([ٱلْحَال]{.ar})
is a kind of adverb that describes the temporal state of the _[sahib_hal]{.subs}_ 
while the [hal]{.subs}'s governing verb is taking place.
<!--
during the action of the [hal]{.subs}'s [3aamil]{.subs}.
-->
Here is an example of a [hal]{.subs}:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{رَاكِضًا} \txarb{زَيْدٌ} \txarb{جَاءَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-1.north west) -- (word-1.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-2.north west) -- (word-2.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize person of ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-3.north west) -- (word-3.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize governor};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=3ex, right=-1ex, align=left] {``Zayd came running''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

What we mean by
"temporal state of the [sahib_hal]{.subs}"
is that
Zayd, while he was coming, was in a running state.
It is a temporary state because Zayd is only described as running while he is coming.
By the way,
we are not not using "state" here terminologically, as in [ustate]{.subs}, [astate]{.subs}, etc.
Rather we are using it to mean Zayd's condition or mode of being.

Note that, like adverbs in general, the [hal]{.subs} is in the [astate]{.subs}.
Typically, the [hal]{.subs} is an [sifah]{.subs}, its [3aamil]{.subs} is a verb, and the [hal]{.subs} describes the [sahib_hal]{.subs}.
But, as we will see later in this chapter [ia]{.subs}, sometimes the [hal]{.subs} may have differing behavior.
