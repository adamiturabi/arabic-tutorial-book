# Plurals : Sound plurals

## Introduction

Arabic uses the plural for nouns in number three and higher. The formation and use of plurals in Arabic can be somewhat complicated. Furthermore, there is sometimes more than one way to use plurals. In this chapter we will explain the most common usage to keep things as simple as possible.

English regularly forms the plural by adding the latter "s" to the end of a singular noun. For example:

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| book       | books      |
| house      | houses     |
| boy        | boys       |
| girl       | girls      |

However, English also has an _irregular_ plural for a few common nouns:

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

Arabic also has two types of plurals:

1. Sound plurals: The singular noun is kept sound (intact) and a plural ending is added to the singular noun just like the English "s".
2. Broken plurals: The singular noun is not kept intact but is "broken up" in forming the plural.

In this chapter we will introduce sound plurals.

Sound plurals are formed by adding a plural ending to the singular noun. There are two plurals that can be formed:

1. The [Un]{.trn} plural.
2. The [At]{.trn} plural.

We will describe each of them in detail.

## The [Un]{.trn} plural

The [Un]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـُونَ]{.ar} [Una]{.trn} to the singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـِينَ]{.ar} [Ina]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. For convenience, we will call it the "[Un]{.trn} plural" instead of the "[Una]{.trn}/[Ina]{.trn} plural".

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "a teacher"  | [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimun]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمًا]{.ar}<br>[muealliman]{.trn} |[مُعَلِّمٍ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimin]{.trn} | 
| "teachers"  | [مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimUna]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimIna]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimIna]{.trn} |

Note that there are no [n]{.trn} marks for the [Un]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "the male teacher"  | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}<br>[Ealmueallimu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَ]{.ar}<br>[Ealmueallima]{.trn} |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِ]{.ar}<br>[Ealmueallimi]{.trn} | 
| "the male teachers"  | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar}<br>[EalmueallimUna]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar}<br>[EalmueallimIna]{.trn} | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar}<br>[EalmueallimIna]{.trn} |

Except for a few exceptions, the [Un]{.trn} plural is only used for male human beings. Of these exceptions, the word [سَنَةٌ]{.ar} [sanatun]{.trn} "a year" is the most commonly used. It is pluralized as [سِنُونَ]{.ar} [sinUna]{.trn} in the u-state and [سِنِينَ]{.ar} [sinIna]{.trn} in the a-state and i-state.

## The [At]{.trn} plural

The [At]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـَاتٌ]{.ar} [Atun]{.trn} to the indefinite singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـَاتٍ]{.ar} [Atin]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state.

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "an animal"  | [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnun]{.trn}| [حَيَوَانًا]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnan]{.trn} |[حَيَوَانٍ]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnin]{.trn} | 
| "animals"  | [حَيَوَانَاتٌ]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnAtun]{.trn}| [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnAtin]{.trn} | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar}<br>[HayawAnAtin]{.trn} |

Note that there _are_ [n]{.trn} marks for the [At]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way but they won't have [n]{.trn} marks:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "the animal"  | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAnu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAna]{.trn} |[ٱَلْحَيَوَانِ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAni]{.trn} | 
| "the animals"  | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAnAti]{.trn} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar}<br>[EalHayawAnAti]{.trn} |

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is removed before appending the [At]{.trn} plural ending:

| Meaning    | u-state | a-state | i-state |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| "a female teacher"  | [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimatun]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَةً]{.ar}<br>[mueallimatan]{.trn} |[مُعَلِّمَةٍ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimatin]{.trn} | 
| "female teachers"  | [مُعَلِّمَاتٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimAtun]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimAtin]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimAtin]{.trn} |

FIXME: Pulmah PulumAt

The [At]{.trn} is used for female human beings and also for many other nouns.

Examples

The female teachers are in the school.

The bakers are Muslims.

## Plurals with descriptive nouns

In the pluralization of descriptive nouns Arabic distinguishes between rational beings (humans, angels, and jinn) and non-rational beings (animals, inanimate objects, abstract concepts, etc.).

When a descriptive noun is describing a plural noun denoting rational beings, then the descriptive noun will be pluralized. For example,

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ طَيِّبُونَ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna TayyibUna]{.trn}  
"The male teachers are good."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَاتُ ٱلطَّوِيلَاتُ سَرِيعَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ljAriyAtu -TTawIlAtu sarIeAtin]{.trn}  
"The tall girls were fast."

When a descriptive noun is describing a plural noun denoting non-rational beings, then the descriptive noun will typically not be pluralized. The feminine singular descriptive noun is used instead, even if the described noun is masculine. For example,

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ ٱلْوَحْشَةُ كَبِيرَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnAtu -lwaHcatu kabIratun]{.trn}  
"The wild animals are big."

[كَانَتِ ٱلسِّنُونَ طَوِيلَةً.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ssinUna TawIlatan]{.trn}  
"The years were long."

Note, however, that when a descriptive noun denoting non-rational beings is used as a regular noun (i.e. the described noun is not mentioned), then it will be pluralized. But remember that the [Un]{.trn} plural is only used for male human beings. So the [At]{.trn} plural will be used, even if the descriptive noun refers to a masculine object. For example,

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ كَبِيرَةٌ وَصَغِيرَةٌ. ٱَلْكَبِيرَاتُ قَوِيَّةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnatu kabIratun wa SagIratun. EalkabIrAtu qawiyyatun]{.trn}  
"The animals are big and small. The big ones are strong."

In the example above, in the first sentence the descriptive nouns [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} "big" and [صَغِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [SagIratun]{.trn} "small" are in the feminine singular because they are describing the non-human plural described noun [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn} "the animals". 

But in the second sentence, the descriptive noun 
[ٱَلْكَبِيرَاتُ]{.ar} [EalkabIrAtu]{.trn} "the big ones"
is used as a regular noun so it takes the [At]{.trn} plural. It is also the described noun for the descriptive noun [قَوِيَّةٌ]{.ar} [qawiyyatun]{.trn} "strong".  [قَوِيَّةٌ]{.ar} is feminine singular because it is describing the non-human plural described noun [ٱَلْكَبِيرَاتُ]{.ar} [EalkabIrAtu]{.trn} "the big ones".

## Remove 

Arabic too forms some plurals by appending one of two endings to the singular nouns. Examples:

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimun]{.trn}<br>"a male teacher"       | [مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimUna]{.trn}<br>"male teachers"       |
| [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimatun]{.trn}<br>"a female teacher"       | [مُعَلِّمَاتٌ]{.ar}<br>[mueallimAtun]{.trn}<br>"female teachers"       |
