# Broken plurals

## Introduction

English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending "s". Here are some examples,

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

In these plurals, the letter "s" is not added to the singular, rather the singular noun is modified to form the plural.

Arabic also forms such plurals. They are called _broken_ plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact when forming the plural.

While English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.

Here are some examples:

| Singular | Plural |
|:------------------|:------------------|
|[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}<br>[rajulun]{.trn}<br>"a man" |[رِجَالٌ]{.ar}<br>[rijAlun]{.trn}<br>"men" |
|[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[EimraEatun]{.trn}<br>"a woman" |[نِسَاءٌ]{.ar}<br>[nisAEun]{.trn}<br>"women" |
