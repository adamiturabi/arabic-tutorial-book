# Broken plurals

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending "s" to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending "s". Here are some examples,

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

In these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.

Arabic also forms such plurals. They are called _broken_ plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or "broken-up" when forming the plural.

While English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.

## The broken plural and patterns

Remember that Arabic nouns are derived from roots which are usually three, but sometimes four or more, letters. Also that three-letter roots and word patterns are exemplified using the template root [فعل]{.arroot}. And that four-letter roots are exemplified using the template root [فعلل]{.arroot}. For example, the word [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} has the root [رجل]{.arroot} and is of the pattern [فَعُلٌ]{.ar} [faeulun]{.trn}. 

Arabic broken plurals fall into patterns. The plural of [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is [رِجَالٌ]{.ar} [rijAlun]{.trn}. The pattern of this plural is [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}, which is a common plural pattern. Another broken plural with this pattern is [جِبَالٌ]{.ar} [jibAlun]{.trn} "mountains" plural of [جَبَلٌ]{.ar} [jabalun]{.trn} "a mountain".

Note that, plurals of the pattern [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn} are fully-changing so they have an [n]{.trn}-mark when indefinite, which will depend on the state of the plural. Here is an example sentence:

[صَعَدَ رِجَالٌ جًبَالًا]{.ar}  
[Saeada -rrijAlu jibAlan.]{.trn}  
"The men went up the mountain."

There are other plural patterns which are non-fully-changing, for example, [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn}, plural of [غَنِيٌ]{.ar} [ganiyyun]{.trn} "rich", of the pattern [أَفْعِلَاءُ]{.ar} [EafeilAEu]{.trn}.  Note that this plural pattern ends with [اء]{.ar} which is external to the root [فعل]{.arroot}. [اء]{.ar}, [ة]{.ar}, and [ىٰ]{.ar}, when external to the root, are feminine markers for singular nouns, but not for plural nouns.  However, just like for singular nouns, when a broken plural ends with [اء]{.ar} or [ىٰ]{.ar} which is external to its root, the broken plural will be non-fully-changing.

Unfortunately, there is usually not much relation between the pattern of the singular and the pattern of the plural. So you should memorize the plural of a noun with its singular.

## Common patterns for the broken plural

Here are some of the more common broken plural patterns:

Pattern | Example
:-------------|:---------------------------------
[أَفْعَالٌ]{.ar} [EafeAlun]{.trn} | [أَعْمَالٌ]{.ar} [EaemAlun]{.trn} "deeds" plural of [عَمَلٌ]{.ar} [eamalun]{.trn} "a deed"
[فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}   | [قُلُوبٌ]{.ar} [qulUbun]{.trn} "hearts" plural of [قَلْبٌ]{.ar} [qalbun]{.trn} "a heart"
[فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}   | [رِجَالٌ]{.ar} [rijAlun]{.trn} "men" plural of [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man"

[فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [faelA]{.trn} (non-fully-changing)    | [أَسْرَىٰ]{.ar} [EasrA]{.trn} "captives" plural of [أَسِيرٌ]{.ar} [EasIrun]{.trn} "a captive"
[فُعَلَاءُ]{.ar} [fueAlAEu]{.trn} (non-fully-changing) | [عُلَمَاءُ]{.ar} [eulAmAEu]{.trn} "(male) scholars" plural of [عَالِمٌ]{.ar} [eAlimun]{.trn} "a (male) scholar"
[أَفْعِلَاءُ]{.ar} [EafeilAEu]{.trn} (non-fully-changing) | [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn} "rich"
[فُعْلَانٌ]{.ar} [fuelAnun]{.trn} | [بُلْدَانٌ]{.ar} [buldAnun]{.trn} "countries" plural of [بَلَدٌ]{.ar} [baladun]{.trn} "a country"
[فَعَالِلُ]{.ar} [faeAlilu]{.trn} | a

## Usage of broken plurals

The use of broken plurals is a little complicated, and their use in poetry and rhetorical style can be somewhat different from normal usage. Here we will describe whether they are found, and how to use them for the different noun categories according to normal usage.

1. Non-descriptive nouns:
   a. Male rational beings: Very commonly found. Examples:
      + [غِلْمَانٌ]{.ar} [gilmAnun]{.trn} "boys" plural of [غُلَامٌ]{.ar} [gulAmun]{.trn} "a boy".
      + [عُلَمَاءُ]{.ar} [eulamAEu]{.trn} "(male) scholars" plural of [عَالِمٌ]{.ar} [eAlimun]{.trn} "a (male) scholar".
   b. Female rational beings: Very uncommon but, they do exist. Examples:
      + [إِمَاءٌ]{.ar} [EimAEun]{.trn} "slave-women" plural of [أَمَةٌ]{.ar} [Eamatun]{.trn} "a slave-woman"
      + [حَرَائِرُ]{.ar} [HarAEiru]{.trn} "free-women" plural of [حُرَّةٌ]{.ar} [Hurratun]{.trn} "a free-woman".

      Typically, though, female rational beings will use the [At]{.trn} sound plural, for example [عَالِمَاتٌ]{.ar} [eAlimAtun]{.trn} plural of [عَالِمَةٌ]{.ar} [eAlimatun]{.trn} "a (female) scholar".
   c. Non-rational beings (both masculine and feminine): very common. Examples:
      + [هِرَرٌ]{.ar} [hirarun]{.trn} "cats" plural of [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat".
      + [سُيُوفٌ]{.ar} [suyUfun]{.trn} "swords" plural of [سَيْفٌ]{.ar} [sayfun]{.trn} "a sword".
2. Descriptive nouns:
   a. Male rational beings: Very common. Examples:
      + [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn}, plural of [غَنِيٌ]{.ar} [ganiyyun]{.trn} "rich (masc.)".
      + [كِرَامٌ]{.ar} [kirAmun]{.trn}, plural of [كَرِيمٌ]{.ar} [karImun]{.trn} "noble, generous (masc.)".
      + [ٱَلرِّجَالُ ٱلْأَغْنِيَاءُ كِرَامٌ.]{.ar}  
        [EarrijAlu -lEagniyAEu kirAmun.]{.trn}  
        "The rich men are generous."
   b. Female rational beings: Apart from a few exceptions, this is almost unused in normal usage. The [At]{.trn} plural is used instead, for example [ عَالِمَاتٌ كَرِيمَاتٌ]{.ar} [eAlimAtun karImAtun]{.trn} "noble (female) scholars".
   c. Non-rational beings: also unused. The feminine singular is used for describers in a noun-phrase or for descrptive nouns in the information of a sentence. The [At]{.trn} plural is used otherwise. Example:  
      [ٱَلْكُتُبُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ ثَقِيلَةٌ وَٱلصَّغِيرَاتُ خَفِيفَةٌ.]{.ar}  
      [Ealkutubu -lkabIratu vaqIlatun wa-SSagIrAtu xafIfatun.]{.trn}  
      "The big books are heavy and the small ones are light."

### Multiple broken plurals for a noun

Some nouns have multiple broken plurals that can be used, more or less, interchangeably. For example:

+ [طُلَّابٌ]{.ar} [TullAbun]{.trn} and [طَلَبَةٌ]{.ar} [Talabatun]{.trn} plurals of [طَلِبٌ]{.ar} [Talibun]{.trn} "a (male) student".
+ [شُهُورٌ]{.ar} [cuhUrun]{.trn} and [أَشْهُرٌ]{.ar} [Eachurun]{.trn} plurals of [شَهْرٌ]{.ar} [cahrun]{.trn} "a month".

In some cases one of these plurals may be used to indicate a larger quantity and the other a smaller quantity, but this rule is not worth worrying about much for now.

Other nouns have multple broken plurals too but here each broken plural is used for a different meaning. For example:

+ [أَمْرٌ]{.ar} [Eamrun]{.trn} can mean both :
  1. "a matter, an affair", pluralized as [أُمُورٌ]{.ar} [EumUrun]{.trn} "matters, affairs"
  2. "a command, an order", pluralized as [أَوَامِرُ]{.ar} [EawAmiru]{.trn} (non-fully-changing) "commands, orders".  

### Poetry and rhetorical style

We had mentioned that our explanation of the use of broken plurals above is according to normal usage. Here, broken plurals of descriptive nouns are used almost always for male rational beings. Female rational beings generally use the [At]{.trn} sound plural while non-rational beings use the feminine singular.

However, in poetry and rhetorical prose, broken plurals of descriptive nouns may often be used with female rational beings and non-rational beings as well. Thus you may see:

[كُتُبٌ ثِقَالٌ]{.ar}  
[kutubun viqAlun]{.trn}  
"heavy books"

instead of the more normal:

[كُتُبٌ ثَقِلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[kutubun vaqIlatun]{.trn}  
"heavy books"

It is important to assert that not all broken plurals may be used as such. And for now we recommend that you not emulate this style. Rather stick to the normal usage we had explained earlier. But you should not be surprised to find occasional use in this other manner as well.

### Co-existence of sound [Un]{.trn} and broken plurals

There are many nouns which can be pluralized with both sound [Un]{.trn} plurals and broken plurals. For example,

+ [عَالِمٌ]{.ar} [eAlimun]{.trn} "a (male) scholar" can be pluralized using the sound [Un]{.trn} plural as [عَالِمُونَ]{.ar} [eAlimUna]{.trn} as well as with the broken plural [عُلَمَاءُ]{.ar} [eulamAEu]{.trn}.
+ [كَافِرٌ]{.ar} [kAfirun]{.trn} "a (male) disbeliever" can be pluralized using the sound [Un]{.trn} plural as [كَافِرُونَ]{.ar} [kAfirUna]{.trn} as well as with the broken plurals [كُفَّارٌ]{.ar} [kuffArun]{.trn} and [كَفَرَةٌ]{.ar} [kafaratun]{.trn}.

In fact, all masculine descriptive nouns  that form their feminine by the addition of [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [Un]{.trn} plural in addition to any broken plurals that they might have. However, this [Un]{.trn} plural may only be used with male rational beings. For example,

+ [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big (masc.)" forms its feminine with the addition of [ة]{.ar}: [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn}. Therefore it can be pluralized with the sound [Un]{.trn} plural [كَبِيرُونَ]{.ar} (when referring to male rational beings) as well as its broken plural [كِبَارٌ]{.ar} [kibArun]{.trn}.
+ [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} "very angry (masc.)" forms its feminine without [ة]{.ar}: [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}. Therefore it will not form the sound [Un]{.trn} plural and it may have only its broken plural [غِضَابٌ]{.ar} [giDabun]{.trn}.

It is also possible to use both sound [Un]{.trn} and broken plurals in the same phrase and sentence. For example,

[ٱَلرِّجَالُ ٱلْأَغْنِيَاءُ كَرِيمُونَ]{.ar}  
[EarrijAlu -lEagniyAEu karImUna.]{.trn}  
"The rich men are generous."

For now, we recommend that you prefer to use the broken plural when possible, even if a word can form the sound [Un]{.trn} plural. Although more difficult for the beginner, this is more common in normal usage. In the vocabulary lists that we provide, we will typically not provide sound [Un]{.trn} plurals, even if they are technically possible, unless they are commonly used.
