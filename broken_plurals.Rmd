# Broken plurals

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending "s" to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending "s". Here are some examples,

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

In these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.

Arabic also forms such plurals. They are called _broken_ plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or "broken-up" when forming the plural.

While English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.

## The broken plural and patterns

Remember that Arabic nouns are derived from roots which are usually three, but sometimes four or more, letters. Also that three-letter roots and word patterns are exemplified using the template root [فعل]{.arroot}. And that four-letter roots are exemplified using the template root [فعلل]{.arroot}. For example, the word [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} has the root [رجل]{.arroot} and is of the pattern [فَعُلٌ]{.ar} [faeulun]{.trn}. 

Arabic broken plurals fall into patterns. The plural of [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is [رِجَالٌ]{.ar} [rijAlun]{.trn}. The pattern of this plural is [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}, which is a common plural pattern. Another broken plural with this pattern is [جِبَالٌ]{.ar} [jibAlun]{.trn} "mountains" plural of [جَبَلٌ]{.ar} [jabalun]{.trn} "a mountain".

Note that, plurals of the pattern [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn} are fully-changing so they have an [n]{.trn}-mark when indefinite, which will depend on the state of the plural. Here is an example sentence:

[صَعَدَ رِجَالٌ جًبَالًا]{.ar}  
[Saeada -rrijAlu jibAlan.]{.trn}  
"The men went up the mountain."

There are other plural patterns which are non-fully-changing, for example, [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn}, plural of [غَنِيٌ]{.ar} [ganiyyun]{.trn} "rich", of the pattern [أَفْعِلَاءُ]{.ar} [EafeilAEu]{.trn}.  Note that this plural pattern ends with [اء]{.ar} which is external to the root [فعل]{.arroot}. [اء]{.ar}, [ة]{.ar}, and [ىٰ]{.ar}, when external to the root, are feminine markers for singular nouns, but not for plural nouns.  However, just like for singular nouns, when a broken plural ends with [اء]{.ar} or [ىٰ]{.ar} which is external to its root, the broken plural will be non-fully-changing.

Unfortunately, there is usually not much relation between the pattern of the singular and the pattern of the plural. So you should memorize the plural of a noun with its singular.

## Common patterns for broken plural

Here are some of the more common broken plural patterns:

Pattern | Example
:-------------|:---------------------------------
[أَفْعَالٌ]{.ar} [EafeAlun]{.trn} | [أَعْمَالٌ]{.ar} [EaemAlun]{.trn} "deeds" plural of [عَمَلٌ]{.ar} [eamalun]{.trn} "a deed"
[فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}   | [قُلُوبٌ]{.ar} [qulUbun]{.trn} "hearts" plural of [قَلْبٌ]{.ar} [qalbun]{.trn} "a heart"
[فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}   | [رِجَالٌ]{.ar} [rijAlun]{.trn} "men" plural of [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man"
[كُتُبٌ]{.ar} [fueulun]{.trn}    | [كُتُبٌ]{.ar} [kutubun]{.trn} "books" plural of [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book"

| Singular | Plural |
|:------------------|:------------------|
|[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}<br>[rajulun]{.trn}<br>"a man" |[رِجَالٌ]{.ar}<br>[rijAlun]{.trn}<br>"men" |
|[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[EimraEatun]{.trn}<br>"a woman" |[نِسَاءٌ]{.ar}<br>[nisAEun]{.trn}<br>"women" |

## Usage of broken plurals

Note that [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn} is the plural of the descriptive noun [غَنِيٌ]{.ar} [ganiyyun]{.trn} "rich". So just like for sound plurals, broken plurals can exist for both non-descriptive and descriptive nouns. And just like for sound plurals when a descriptive noun is describing a plural noun denoting non-rational beings, either as the describer in a noun-phrase, or in the information of a sentence, then the descriptive noun will typically not be pluralized. The feminine singular descriptive noun is used instead, even if the described noun is masculine. For example,

[الرجال الأغنياء على جبال عالية]{.ar}  

FIXME: Add broken plurals for descriptive nouns typically used for male rational beings.


FIXME: show imra2ah-nisaa2 at the end as an exception, imra2-qawm, insaan-naas?
