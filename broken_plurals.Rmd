# Broken plurals

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending "s" to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending "s". Here are some examples,

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

In these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.

Arabic also forms such plurals. They are called _broken_ plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or "broken-up" when forming the plural.

While English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.

## Patterns of the broken plural

Remember that Arabic nouns are derived from roots which are usually three, but sometimes four or more, letters. Also that roots and word patterns are exemplified using the template root [فعل]{.arroot}. for example, the word [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} has the root [رجل]{.arroot} and is of the pattern [فَعُل]{.ar} [faeul]{.trn}. Patterns are key to the study of Arabic broken plurals.

Here are some examples:

| Singular | Plural |
|:------------------|:------------------|
|[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}<br>[rajulun]{.trn}<br>"a man" |[رِجَالٌ]{.ar}<br>[rijAlun]{.trn}<br>"men" |
|[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[EimraEatun]{.trn}<br>"a woman" |[نِسَاءٌ]{.ar}<br>[nisAEun]{.trn}<br>"women" |

FIXME: show imra2ah-nisaa2 at the end as an exception, imra2-qawm, insaan-naas?
