# Broken plurals

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending "s" to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending "s". Here are some examples,

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| man        | men        |
| woman      | women      |
| child      | children   |
| mouse      | mice       |

In these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.

Arabic also forms such plurals. They are called _broken_ plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or "broken-up" when forming the plural.

While English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.

## Patterns of the broken plural

Remember that Arabic nouns are derived from roots which are usually three, but sometimes four or more, letters. Also that roots and word patterns are exemplified using the template root [فعل]{.arroot}. For example, the word [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} has the root [رجل]{.arroot} and is of the pattern [فَعُل]{.ar} [faeul]{.trn}. 

Arabic broken plurals fall into patterns. The plural of [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is [رِجَالٌ]{.ar} [rijAlun]{.trn}. The pattern of the plural is [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn}, which is a common plural pattern. Another noun with this plural pattern is [جَبَلٌ]{.ar} [jabalun]{.ar} plural [جِبَالٌ]{.ar} [jibAlun]{.trn}.

Note that, plurals of the pattern [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn} is fully-changing so it has an [n]{.trn}-mark, which will depend on the state of the plural. Here is an example sentence:

[صَعَدَ رِجَالٌ جًبَالًا]{.ar}  
[Saeada -rrijAlu jibAlan.]{.trn}  
"The men went up the mountain."

There are other plural patterns which are non-fully-changing, for example, [غَنِيٌ]{.ar} [ganiyyun]{.trn} "rich" plural [أَغْنِيَاءُ]{.ar} [EagniyAEu]{.trn} of the pattern [أَفْعِلَاءُ]{.ar} [EafeilAEu]{.trn}. Note that this plural pattern ends with [اء]{.ar} which is a feminine marker for singular nouns, but not for plural nouns. In fact, the three feminine markers that we have studied [ة، اء، ىٰ]{.ar} are only feminine markers for singular nouns. All three are found as endings for broken plurals as well. But they do not make the plural feminine. In fact, as a general trend, they are likely to make the plural applicable to masculine nouns.

However, just like for singular nouns, when a broken plural ends with [اء]{.ar} and [ىٰ]{.ar} which is external to its root, the broken plural will be non-fully-changing.

Unfortunately, there is usually not much relation between the pattern of the singular and the pattern of the plural. So you should probably memorize that plural of a noun with its singular.

Here are some of the more common broken plural patterns:


Pattern | Example
:------------------|:------------------
[أَفْعَالٌ]{.ar} [EafeAl]{.trn} | [أَعْمَال]{.ar}

| Singular | Plural |
|:------------------|:------------------|
|[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}<br>[rajulun]{.trn}<br>"a man" |[رِجَالٌ]{.ar}<br>[rijAlun]{.trn}<br>"men" |
|[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar}<br>[EimraEatun]{.trn}<br>"a woman" |[نِسَاءٌ]{.ar}<br>[nisAEun]{.trn}<br>"women" |

FIXME: show imra2ah-nisaa2 at the end as an exception, imra2-qawm, insaan-naas?
