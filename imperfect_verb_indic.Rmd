# Unfinished-action verbs

## Introduction

So far we have learned finished-action verbs with the different doer-modifications. Finished-action verbs are used when an action is finished. For example, [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "he wrote" indicates that the act of writing has been finished.

## Unfinished-action verb states

An unfinished-action verb is used when the action of the verb has not been finished. Unfinished-action verbs have states similar to how nouns have states. This is different from finished-action verbs which don't have state. The table below gives the unfinished-action verb counterparts to the finished-action verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "he wrote":

|u-state|a-state|null-state|
|:----|:----|:----|
|[يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} [yaktubu]{.trn}|[يَكْتُبَ]{.ar} [yaktuba]{.trn}|[يَكْتُبْ]{.ar} [yaktub]{.trn}|

The basic state of verb is the u-state. [يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} [yaktubu]{.trn} means "he writes" or "he is writing". The a-state and null-state unfinished-action verbs give different meanings and we will deal with them in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills. In this chapter we will deal with u-state unfinished-action verbs.

## Unfinished-action verb doer-modifications

Finished-action verbs' doer-modifications are suffixes to the verb. In contrast, unfinished-action verbs' doer-modifications affect both the beginning and the end of the basic verb stem. 

Here is a table of the finished-action verb and and the u-state unfinished-action verb for the root [فَعَلَ]{.arroot}:

|Person|Finished-action|Unfinished-action u-state|

## Vowels in unfinished-action verbs

We had mentioned that vowel on the middle letter in a finished-action verb can vary depending on the verb. So we can have,

+ [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "he wrote"
+ [عَمِلَ]{.ar} [eamila]{.trn} "he worked"
+ [كَبُرَ]{.ar} [kabura]{.trn} "he became big"

Similarly, the vowel on the middle letter in an unfinished-action verb can also vary depending on the verb. So generally, this will need to be looked up in a dictionary and memorized. But there are the following rules which limit the variation:

1. If the finished-action verb has an [a]{.trn}-mark on the middle letter, the unfinished-action verb's middle letter can have either an [a]{.trn}-mark, [i]{.trn}-mark, or an [u]{.trn}-mark, depending on the verb. For example,

   + [كَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ]{.ar} [kataba yaktubu]{.trn} "he wrote, he writes"
   + [ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ]{.ar} [pahaba yaphabu]{.trn} "he went, he goes"
   + [كَشَفَ يَكْشِفُ]{.ar} [kacafa yakcifu]{.trn} "he uncovered, he uncovers"

2. If the finished-action verb has an [i]{.trn}-mark on the middle letter, the unfinished-action verb's middle letter can have either an [i]{.trn}-mark or an [a]{.trn}-mark, depending on the verb, with [a]{.trn}-mark being more common. For example,

   + [عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ]{.ar} [eamila yaemalu]{.trn} "he worked, he works"
   + [عَلِمَ يَعْلَمُ]{.ar} [ealima yaelamu]{.trn} "he knew, he knows"

3. If the finished-action verb has an [u]{.trn}-mark on the middle letter, the unfinished-action verb's middle letter shall have a [u]{.trn}-mark. For example,

   + [كَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ]{.ar} [kabura yakburu]{.trn} "he grew big, he grows big"


## Examples of usage

Unfinished-action verbs can, in general, give the meaning of both an action which is habitually done, like "He goes to school." or an action which is being done right now "He is going to school." Both of these can be expressed with [يَذْهَبُ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}.

Here are some examples of sentences with unfinished-action verbs.

Sometimes, the English past tense and present tense may not match the Arabic finished-action and unfinished-action respectively. Examples,
