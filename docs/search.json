    "text": "Work in progress.\n\nNot ready for study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTHIS BOOK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS INCOMPLETE AND MAY HAVE TYPOGRAPHICAL AND OTHER ERRORS. IT IS NOT YET READY FOR STUDY.\n\n\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary texts of Islām (the Qurʾān and the Ḥadīt͡h) are in Arabic. So too is much of its scholarly literature. However, there are many Muslims for whom Arabic is not a native language, yet who are familiar enough with English to study textbooks written in this language. The goal of this book is to help them learn Arabic so that, together with a study of the appropriate expositional texts, they can start to understand the primary texts in their original language. We hope that this will, if Allāh wills, make them more connected to the primary texts and their teachings. Furthermore, they can be empowered to study the vast body of Arabic Islāmic literature.\n\nRegarding the title of this book: the Arab grammarians were describing the Arabic language of the time of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. They were doing this by drawing upon a corpus that included transmitted texts and the dialectal speech of informants. We term the language of this corpus to be Classical Arabic, because of its considerable volume and its agreed upon significance and eloquence. In the process of the grammarians’ sifting through and describing the dialectal variation of Classical Arabic, a standard variety emerged and gained prevalence. Thenceforth, virtually all composed texts attempted to conform to the grammar of this standard. And it is the grammar of this Standard Classical Arabic (sca) that is the subject of this work.\nsca, as a standard, is not exactly defined in its entirety. There is a core which is more or less agreed upon, and then there are fringe dialectal, rare, and anomalous usages, regarding whose acceptability the grammarians have differed. We have attemped to convey both these aspects when the occasion has demanded it.\nWhile the grammar which we cover in this book is of sca, the vocabulary may include legitimate post-classical words and meanings. But we stop short of dealing with Modern Standard Arabic (msa). Because the preponderance of its modern vocabulary would detract from the main focus of this book. And also because Western grammar works which focus on msa tend to use modern texts as a corpus to re-describe and re-codify its grammar. Which is fine, as a methodology, because their goal is to understand the meaning of msa texts. If we were to include msa, as thus defined, in this book, then we would have to explain the conflicts between it and sca. Which is something we are not ready, or equipped, to deal with.\n\nThis book is a learning or teaching grammar, as opposed to being strictly a reference grammar. Therefore, whenever we were able to, we have tried to explain topics, and give examples, in a manner that assumes an understanding of only preceding content. We have, at the same time, generally tried to group content coherently for convenient reference during learning.\nWe have also aimed to make this a self-instruction textbook so that a diligent student should, if Allāh wills, be able to study it independently. The target learner is someone who has not been exposed to grammatical terminology beyond a grade school level. While terminology is necessary for a rigorous non-immersive learning of language, we have tried to steer away from Latin-based terms like accusative, jussive, etc. Such terms, when first encountered by an uninitiated learner, may deter him from proceeding further. So we have in some places translated the meaning of Arabic grammar terms to English. In other places, we have used established English grammar terms where the terms are basic enough. We have even, in places, invented terms where we deemed appropriate. We have also used some grammatical terminology from Arabic directly, usually in cases where our target learner may have already been exposed to them from Qurʾān recitation rules, or where the term is complex enough that creating a term specifically in English wouldn’t make it any simpler. The drawback to this non-standard approach, however, is that the student may not be able to immediately relate the terminology he has learned in this book to established terminology in other grammar textbooks. To remedy this to some extent, we provide a glossary which maps the grammatical terminology used in this book to other, established, Latin-based and Arabic-based counterparts.\n\n\nBecause this is an instructional textbook, we have generally avoided quoting verbatim when drawing material from cited sources, But we haven’t shied away from sticking close to the cited text when we felt we could not better its expression or organization for our purposes. Citations are absent for basic topics, and also where we were not able to find an exact reference for some point that we are trying to make.  In any event, any errors that remain in this book are our own.\n\n\nTechnical matters\n\nThis book is produced using the Quarto authoring and publishing framework and set in the Charis, Vazirmatn, and Amiri typefaces.\nUnless otherwise indicated, translations from the Qurʾān are by Ṣaḥeeḥ International™, sourced from https://quran.com.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the numbering of Ḥadīt͡h is that used by https://sunnah.com.\nThe page numbers for citations may vary across different editions and publishers. We have attempted to specify the edition that we are using in the references.\n\nthe authors",

    "text": "1.1.1 Truth-evaluability\nStatements are classified into two types:\n\na truth-evaluable statement\na non-truth-evaluable statement\n\nA truth-evaluable statement is one that can be judged to be true or false. In other words it is falsifiable. For example, if we have a statement:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nThe above statement may be judged to have a truth value. If zayd is actually standing, then the statement is true. And if zayd is not standing, then the statement is false.\nA non-truth-evaluable statement, on the other hand, does not have a truth value. Here are some examples of non-truth-evaluable statements:\n\nاضْرِبْ زَيْدًا\nBeat Zayd!\nلَا تَفْعَلْ\nDon’t do [it]!\nيَا زَيْدُ\nO Zayd\nمَنْ هُوَ\nWho is he?\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics\n\nSyntax and semantics\nSemantics is the study of the meanings of words. And syntax is the study of how words combine to form phrases and sentences. Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships between the words in a sentence. For example, consider the adjectival noun كَبِير. Semantically, it gives the meaning of something being big. When it is in a linguistic environment, like a phrase or a sentence, then its syntactical role is determined by the grammatical relationships it has with other words in the sentence.\nConsider the following sentence:\n\nالْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ\nThe house is big\n\nIn the above sentence, كَبِير is syntactically a info.\nNow consider the following sentence:\n\nدَخَلَ بَيْتًا كَبِيرًا\nHe entered a big house.\n\nNow the same noun كَبِير is syntactically a attribute. In both examples, كَبِير has the same semantic signification.\n\n\n\nPragmatics\n\nPragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in a specific context or situation.\n\n\n\nStylistics\nIn order to express a meaning, there will often be a normal way to choose words or construct a sentence’s structure. If, for some effect (rhetorical, persuasive, literary, etc.), the speaker chooses to deviate from this norm, then he is doing so for stylistic reasons.1",

    "section": "1.2 The theory of government",
    "text": "1.2 The theory of government\nA sentence in Arabic is constituted from elements. An element can be a noun, a verb, or a particle. Of these elements, some have the quality of state. These are called stateful elements. The stateful elements are nouns and stateful verbs. A noun may be either in the u-state, a-state, or i-state. And a stateful verb may be either in the u-state, a-state, or 0-state. The theory of government states that a stateful element is put in a particular state by a governor. For example:\n\nفِي الدَّارِ\nin the house\n\nIn the above example,  the gpreposition فِي causes the noun الدَّار to be in the i-state. So we say that the governor فِي governs الدَّار (the governee) in the i-state.",

We will make use of the following example:\n\nقَرَأَ الْغُلَامُ الطَّوِيلُ كِتَابَ الجَارِيَةِ فِي الدَّارِ الْكَبِيرَةِ\n\n\nThe i-state noun\nA noun in the i-state is governed by a preceding preposition or annexe noun. We have already seen that the i-state noun الدَّار is governed by the preceding preposition فِي.  We also see that the i-state base noun الجَارِيَةِ is governed by the annexe noun كِتَابَ.\n\n\nThe doer\nThe doer of a verb is governed by its preceding verb. In our example the verb قَرَأَ governs its doer الْغُلَامُ in the u-state.\n\n\nThe direct doee\nThe direct doee is also governed by its verb. In our example the verb قَرَأَ governs its direct doee كِتَابَ in the a-state.\n\n\nThe attribute\nA attribute is governed by governor of its attributee. In our example, the attribute الطَّوِيلُ is governed in the u-state by قَرَأَ, which is the governor of its attributee الْغُلَامُ. Similarly, the attribute الْكَبِيرَةِ is governed in the i-state by the preposition فِي because فِي also governs its attributee الدَّارِ.\n\n\n\nUngoverned elements\nNot every element in a sentence is governed by a governor. For example, the perfect verb قَرَأَ has no state, and thus, no governor.\nHere is a diagram depicting the above governor-governee relationships:\nDIAGRAM",

    "text": "1.4 The two structural elements of a sentence\nIn the Arabic grammatical model, a sentence is analagous to the structure of a simple lean-to building.  This structure requires two structural elements in order to be structurally complete.2 These two structural elements are:\n\nThe structure-starter\nThe structure-completer\n\n\nThe structure-starter is the primary structural element. It represents whom the sentence is about, i.e. its topic. The structure-completer rests against the structure-starter.  It expresses some property about the structure-starter that completes the meaning of the sentence.\nOnce the two structural elements are in place, the sentence is structurally complete. Other dispensable elements (see section (ref) below) may be added in addition to the structural elements to add meaning to the sentence, but they are not required to make the sentence structurally complete.\nLet’s look at the structural elements for the two types of Arabic sentences:\n\n\n1.4.1 The structural elements of a nounal sentence\nIn a nounal sentence the subject is the structure-starter and the info is the structure-completer. Consider the following nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nDIAGRAM\nExample (10) above is a nounal sentence. The subject زَيْدٌ is the structure-starter. It is the topic of the sentence. The info قَائِمٌ is the structure-completer. It is a comment on the topic, giving us some information about زَيْدٌ.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 The structural elements of a verbal sentence\nIn a verbal sentence the verb is the structure-completer and its doer is the structure-starter. Consider the following verbal sentence:\n\nقَامَ زَيْدٌ\n\nDIAGRAM\nExample (11) above is a verbal sentence. The doer زَيْدٌ is the structure-starter. It is the topic of the sentence. And the verb قَامَ is the structure-completer. It is a comment on the topic.",

    "text": "1.5 Foundational government\n\nIn order to build a sentence from the structural elements, a sentence needs foundational government.[Owens §2.3.6.1, 54]   Foundational government is any and all government prior to, and until, the first governed structural element.\n\nOne of the two structural elements is the foundational government\nIn some sentences, the intitial governor may be one of the two structural elements. In example (11) above, the verb قَامَ governs its doer زَيْدٌ. The perfect verb قَامَ has no state and thus needs no governor. So it is, itself, the foundational government.\nDIAGRAM\n\n\nAnother (non-structural) element is the foundational government\nThe intitial governor may be internal to the sentence but not one of the two structural elements. \nHere are some examples:\n\nلَمْ يَضْرِبِ الرَّجُلُ غُلَامَ زَيْدٍ [Owens, J., The foundations of grammar §2.2.3, 41]\nThe man did not beat Zayd’s slave.\n\nDIAGRAM\n\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ\nIndeed Zayd is standing.\n\nDIAGRAM\n\n\n\nThe abstract foundational government\nVery commonly, the foundational government is not an actual word, but only an abstract concept. When there is one or more stateful structural elements in a sentence with no overt (i.e. observable) governor, then this necessitates bringing in a abstract foundational government.3 For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [Peled, Sentence types 87]\nZayd is setting out.\n\nThe abstract foundational government governs both the structure-starter (the subject زَيْدٌ), and the structure-completer (the info مُنْطَلِقٌ) in the u-state.\n\nيَقُومُ زَيْدٌ\nZayd stands\n\nThe abstract foundational government governs the structure-completer (the stateful verb يَقُومُ) in the u-state. And, as usual, the verb يَقُومُ governs its doer زَيْدٌ (the structure-starter) in the u-state.",

The source of government for a dispensable element must be, directly or indirectly, one of the structural elements.\nWe know from section (ref) above, that in a nounal sentence the structural elements are the subject and the info. And that in a verbal sentence the structural elements are the verb and its doer. So all other elements besides these (and elements that constitute the foundational government) are dispensable elements. Here is an (incomplete) list of some common dispensable elements: \n\nthe attribute\nthe direct doee (usually)\nthe absolute doee (see chapter (ref))\nthe adverb of time and the adverb of place (see chapter (ref))\nthe adverb of reason (see chapter (ref))\nthe accompanying doee (see chapter (ref))\nthe ḥāl (see chapter (ref))\nthe tamyīz (see chapter (ref))\n\nBy the way, when we say dispensable, we mean that an element is dispensable in the sense that it is not required to complete the sentence structurally. We don’t mean that it is superfluous in terms of its meaning. In fact, a dispensable element may be essential for the correct meaning of the sentence. For example, consider the āyah:\n\nوَمَا خَلَقۡنَا ٱلسَّمَاۤءَ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَمَا بَیۡنَهُمَا لَـٰعِبِینَ [سورة الأنبياء 21:16 cited by معاني النحو 1/14]\nAnd We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.\n\nلَاعِبِينَ is a ḥāl (see in chapter (ref)), which is a dispensable element. If we remove it from the sentence, then the sentence will be structurally complete but it will have an incorrect meaning.",

    "text": "1.7 Refining the definitions of the nounal sentence and the verbal sentence\nWe know that there are two basic types of Arabic sentences:\n\nThe nounal sentence\nThe verbal sentence\n\nPreviously we had said that a nounal sentence is one that begins with a noun. And a nounal sentence is one that begins with a verb. We will now refine these definitions:\n\nA nounal sentence is one whose structural elements are two nouns: a subject (as the structure-starter) and an info (as the structure-completer). And a verbal sentence is one whose structural elements are a verb (as the structure-starter) and and its doer (as the structure-completer).\nConsider, for example, the following sentence:\n\nبَلْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nRather Zayd is standing.\n\nThe first word in the sentence above is بَلْ. It is a particle and not a structural element. Removing it from the sentence, we see that the remaining structural elements are two nouns: زَيْدٌ (the subject) and قَائِمٌ (as the info). So the sentence is a nounal sentence.\nLet’s take a look at another example:\n\nزَيْدًا رَأَيْتُ [Peled, Sentence types 28]\n[It was] Zayd I saw.\n\nThe first word in the sentence is زَيْدًا. It is a direct doee. We learned in section (ref) above that a direct doee is not usually a structural element. Rather, it is usually a dispensable elements Stripping the sentence of this dispensable element, we are left with رَأَيْتُ I saw. This is a verbal sentence. The verb رَأى is the structure-completer and its doer, the pronoun تُ, is the structure-starter.",

    "section": "1.8 Identifying the structural elements in a nounal sentence",
    "text": "1.8 Identifying the structural elements in a nounal sentence\nIt can sometimes be complicated to tell which of the twp structural elements in a nounal sentence is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer. We will discuss several cases below:\n\n1.8.1 When there is an overt foundational government\nWhen there is an overt foundational government, like إِنَّ, كَانَ, etc., then it is usually easy to tell which is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer. For example:\n\nفَإِنَّ حَسۡبَكَ ٱللَّهُ [سورة الأنفال 8:62]\nthen sufficient for you is Allāh\n\nIn example (19) above, حَسْب is in the a-state as the subject and the word ٱللَّهُ is in the u-state as the info. This tells us that حَسْب is the structure-starter and the word ٱللَّهُ is the structure-completer.\n\n\n1.8.2 One structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite\nWhen one structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite, then it is usually the case that the definite element is the structure-starter (as the subject) and the indefinite element is the structure-completer (as the info).\nIn terms of pragmatics, the structure-starter and the structure-completer represent ‘given’ and ‘new’ information. That is, the listener knows who the structure-starter is and can identify him or it. So the structure-starter is a ‘given’ to the listener. And the speaker is providing ‘new’ information about the structure-starter to the listener. The definite element represents the ‘given’ information, which the listener already knows. And the indefinite element represents ‘new’ information.\nLet’s take a look at an example:\n\nتَمِيمِيٌّ أَنَا [Peled, Sentence types 121]\nA Tamīmite I am.\n\nThe pronoun أَنَا is definite. Therefore it is the structure-starter (as the subject). And the word تَمِيمِيٌّ is indefinite. Therefore it is the structure-completer (as the info). Example (20) is an inverted order sentence where the info is fronted and the subject is placed after it.\nIn special cases, some grammarians hold that it is possible to have an indefinite subject and a definite info.4 One special case is when a question noun is the subject. (Question nouns are considered indefinite.) For example:\n\nكَمْ مَالُكَ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/231]\nHow much is your wealth?\nأَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ [جامع الترمذي :3513]\nWhich night is the night of Decree\n\nAnother special case is when the subject is an indefinite comparative noun in sentences like:\n\nخَيْرٌ مِنْكَ زَيْدٌ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/231]\nBetter than you is Zayd\n\nIn the above sentence, خَيْرٌ is considered the subject of the sentence.  \n\n\n1.8.3 Both structural elements are definite\nWhen both structural elements are definite, then typically the first is the subject and the second is the info. For example:\n\nالدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ [صحيح مسلم :55a]\nThe Religion is sincerity.\n\nHowever, if it is known from context that one if the two elements is the ‘given’ information and the other is the ‘new’ information, then the given information will be the subject and the new information will be the info, regardless of word-order.5\nFor example, consider a situation where one wishes to say, “Abū Yūsuf is [like] Abū Ḥanīfah.” (Imām Abū Yūsuf was the foremost student of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah.) The normal way to express this sentence is:\n\nأَبُو يُوسُفَ أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/233]\nAbū Yūsuf is [like] Abū Ḥanīfah.\n\nDIAGRAM\nHowever, if it is pragmatically known that the topic of the sentence is أَبُو يُوسُفَ, then it is ‘given’ that أَبُو يُوسُفَ is the structure-starter (as the subject). Similarly, it is known that likening him to أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ is the ‘new’ information. Therefore, أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ is the structure-completer (as the info). In this case, the sentence order can be flexible, and the info can be fronted (stylistically), for the same meaning, thus:\n\nأَبُو حَنِيفَةَ أَبُو يُوسُفَ\n[Like] Abū Ḥanīfah, Abū Yūsuf is.\n\nDIAGRAM\n\n\n1.8.4 Both structural elements are indefinite\nWhen both structural elements are indefinite then, again, the first is likely to be the subject and the second to be the info. Examples:\n\nأَفْضَلُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/232]\n[The person] better than Zayd is better than Ɛamr.\nوَجَزَ ٰ⁠ۤؤُا۟ سَیِّئَةࣲ سَیِّئَةࣱ مِّثۡلُهَاۖ [سورة الشورى 42:40]\nAnd the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it",

    "section": "1.9 The info as a complete sentence",
    "text": "1.9 The info as a complete sentence\nIn a nounal sentence, the info is, by default, a single noun. See example (1) again:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nIn example (1), قَائِمٌ is a single word and it is the info. This is what we may call a simple nounal sentence.\nIn contrast, in a compound nounal sentence, the info is itself a complete sentence. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd – he stands\n\nIn example (29) above, زَيْدٌ is the subject and يَقُومُ is the info. But يَقُومُ is not a single word here. It is in fact a complete sentence. This is because, as we know, a verb must be followed by its doer. And if there is no overt doer, then a latent doer pronoun is implicated. So يَقُومُ is a a verbal sentence with the meaning he stands.\nHere is example of a compound nounal sentence, whose info is also a nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٌ [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/26]\nZayd – his father is standing.\n\n(FIXME: MOVE THIS TO KAANA CHAPTER):\nCompound sentences are very common with كَانَ. Remember from section (ref) above that كَانَ is a deficient verb, and thus needs a info to grammatically the sentence. This info may be a single word, like:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا\nZayd was standing.\n\nOr the info of كَانَ may be a complete sentence:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd used to stand.\n\n(END FIXME)\nThe info of a compound nounal sentence is typically a truth-evaluable sentence. But it need not be so. A non-truth-evaluable sentence is also valid as a info6 For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ اضْرِبْهُ [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/27]\nZayd – hit him!\n(i.e. Hit Zayd!)\n\n\n1.9.1 The government of the compound nounal sentence sentence\nThe info of a compound nounal sentence is a complete sentence. Therefore, it has its own independent internal government for all elements within it (including its own foundational government). But the entire info is governed, albeit not markedly, by a governor in the outer sentence. For example, consider the following compound nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا\nZayd – he did not hit Ɛamr\n\nIn example (34) above, لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا is a complete sentence that is the info of the outer sentence. This inner sentence has its own internal government, starting with its foundational government لَمْ. The foundational government لَمْ governs the verb يَضْرِبْ in the 0-state. And the verb يَضْرِبْ governs an implicated latent doer pronoun (هُوَ) in the u-state, and the direct doee عَمْرًا in the a-state.\nWe will say that the inner sentence لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the outer sentence.\nThe government of this compound sentence is illustrated in the diagram below:\nDIAGRAM\n\n\n\n1.9.2 Invalid inner sentences\nSome sentences are not valid as inner sentences:\n\nA sentence beginning with لَـٰكِنْ, حَتَّى, or بَلْ is not valid.7\nA vocative sentence is not valid.8 So. we cannot say, for example:\n\n✗ زيد يا أخاه [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/28]\n“Zayd – O his brother.”\n\n\n\n\n1.9.3 The link between the inner and outer sentence\nIt is usually necessary for there to be a link between the inner sentence, and the subject of the outer sentence. This link is typically supplied by a pronoun. Let’s look at some examples:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَامَ أَبُوهُ [المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278]\nZayd – his father stood up.\n\nDIAGRAM\nIn example (36) above, the link is the pronoun هُ in abuuhu.\n\nزَيْدٌ قَامَ [المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278]\nZayd – he stood up.\n\nDIAGRAM\nIn example (37) above, the link is the implied singular masculine pronoun that is the doer of قَامَ.\nGenerally, if there is no such link between the inner sentence and the subject of the outer sentence, then the compound sentence is invalid.9{.citex} So we cannot say, for example:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ قَامَ عَمْرٌ [Peled, Sentence types 94 citing شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]\nZayd – Ɛamr stood up\n\n\nA pointing noun as the link\nInstead of a pronoun, an pointing noun may serve as the link. For example:\n\nوَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ خَیۡرࣱۚ [سورة الأعراف 7:26 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nBut the clothing of righteousness - that is best.\n\n\n\nA repeated subject as the link\nThe subject of the outer sentence may be repeated in the inner sentence, and this is sufficient as the link. For example:\n\nٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝١ مَا ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝٢ [سورة الحاقة 69:1-2 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nThe Inevitable Reality - What is the Inevitable Reality?\n\n\n\nNo need for the link\nIn cases where the info of the outer sentence is more general than its subject a link is not needed. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nZayd – an excellent man\n\nThe link is also not needed when the subject of the outer sentence and its info are perfectly identical in meaning. For example:\n\nنُطْقِي اللَّهُ حَسْبِي [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nMy utterance is “Allāh is sufficient for me.”\nقَوْلِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nMy saying is “There is no god but Allāh.”\n\n\n\nAn implied link\nThe link, even when technically required, is sometimes omitted. But it remains implied. This is in cases in which the sense is perfectly clear without it.10 For example:\n\nٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ بِدِرْهَمٍ [Wright 2/256C; المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278; شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/238]\nThe ghee is (at the rate of) two manās for a dirham.\n\nIn the example above, the sentence with the link restored is ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ مِنْهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ two manās of it for a dirham.",

    "section": "1.10 Other complete sentences in place of nouns",
    "text": "1.10 Other complete sentences in place of nouns\nIt is not only the info which can be replaced with a complete sentence. Other grammatical categories are also, by default, a single noun, but which can be replaced with complete sentences. We will discuss some of these categories below, and treat other categories in their respective chapters (like the ḥāl, the condition-response, and verbs of perception).\n\n\n1.10.1 The direct doee as a complete sentence\nA sentence which is direct speech occurs in the place of a direct doee. For example:\n\nقَالَ إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ [سورة مريم 19:30 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/23]\n[Jesus] said, “Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh.\n\nIn the example above, the sentence إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ is in place of the a-state direct doee of قَالَ.\nA complete sentence can also occur as a direct doee with verbs of perception. Examples:\n\nظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا يَقْرَأُ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/24]\nI believed Zayd [to be] reading.\n\nIn the example above, the verbal sentence يَقْرَأُ is in place of the a-state direct doee of ظَنَنْتُ. We will learn more about this category in chapter (ref), if Allāh wills.\n\n\n1.10.2 The attribute as a complete sentence\nThe attribute is, in principle, a single noun.\nHowever, an sentence entire sentence may occur in place of the single noun. For example, instead of saying مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ قَائِمٍ, we can replace the single word attribute قَائِمٍ with the sentence يَقُومُ, thus:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَقُومُ [الإيضاح للفارسي 308]\nI passed by a man [that] stands.\n(literally: I passed by a ‘he stands’ man.\n\nNote that the stateful verb يَقُومُ is in the u-state. This is because يَقُومُ is a complete sentence (with an implied doer pronoun). So it has its own internal government that is not affected by any element in the outer sentence. Thus, the state of the attributee رَجُلٍ has no effect on any state within the sentence-attribute. However, the entire sentence attribute is in place of a i-state noun as the attribute of رَجُلٍ.\nSubstituing a single-noun attribute with its corresponding stateful verb is the most basic form of the sentence-attribute. However, more complex sentence-attributes may also be formed. For example:\n\nوَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ [سورة البقرة 2:281 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/276]\nAnd fear a Day when you will be returned to Allāh.\n\nIn example (48) above, the sentence تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ is a attribute of يَوْمًا.\n\nThere are three conditions that must be met in order for a sentence to occur as a attribute^: [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/275–278]\n\nThe attributee must be indefinite, either in wording or in meaning.\nThe sentence-attribute must contain a link that links back to the attributee.\nThe sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable.\n\nLet’s discuss each of these conditions.\n\nIndefiniteness of the attributee\nWe already saw an example of an indefinite (in wording) attributee in example (48) above. Here is an example of a attributee which is definite in wording, but indefinite in meaning:\n\nوَلَقَدْ أَمُرُّ عَلَى اللَّئِيمِ يَسُبُّنِي [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/276]\nAnd indeed I pass by the ignoble [person that] insults me\n\nIn example (49) the attributee اللَّئِيمِ is referring to a general person, and is therefore indefinite in meaning.\n\n\nA link that links back to the attributee\nIn example (48), the link, which links back to the attributee يَوْمًا, is the pronoun ه in فِيهِ.\nSometimes the link is not explicit, but is implied. For example:\n\nوَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا لَّا تَجۡزِی نَفۡسٌ عَن نَّفۡسࣲ شَیۡـࣰٔا [سورة البقرة 2:123 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/277]\nAnd fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all\n\nThe implied link is the pronoun ه in an implied فِيهِ, i.e. لَا تَجْزِی فِيهِ.\n\n\nThe sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable\nThe following sentence is impermissible because the attribute اضْرِبْهُ is a non-truth-evaluable sentence.\n\n✗ مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ اضْرِبْهُ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/278]\nI passed by a man – hit him\n\n\n\n\n1.10.3 The base noun in an annexation as a complete sentence\nThe base noun in an annexation may be a complete sentence instead of a single noun. For example:\n\nهَـٰذَا یَوۡمُ یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّـٰدِقِینَ صِدۡقُهُمۡۚ [سورة المائدة 5:119 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/28]\nThis is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.\n\nIn example (52) above the entire sentence یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّادِقِینَ صِدْقُهُمْ is the base noun to the annexe noun يَوْمُ. As with sentence-infos and sentence-attributes, the sentence-base noun has its own internal government. And the sentence-base noun is in place of an i-state noun.\nHere is another example:\n\nیَوۡمَ هُم بَـٰرِزُونَۖ [سورة غافر 40:16 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/29]\nThe Day they come forth",

    "text": "1.11 A foreign element separating a governor from its governee\nA foreign element is one that is not directly governed by a governor. In most cases, a foreign element should not come between (and thus separate) a governor from its governee(s). For example, consider the following sentence:\n\nعَلِمْتُ مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي 66]\nI knew Muḥammad [to be] writing a book.\n\nIn the example above the verbal sentence يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا is in place of the second direct doee of عَلِمْتُ. The noun كِتَابًا is governed directly by the verb يُؤَلِّفُ. So كِتَابًا is a foreign element for the verb عَلِمْتُ. Therefore, the following sentence is impermissible:\n\n✗ عَلِمْتُ كِتَابًا مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي 66]",

    "section": "1.12 The state-of-affairs pronoun",
    "text": "1.12 The state-of-affairs pronoun\nUsually, for pronouns, the pronoun’s referent is a single noun that occurs before it. For example, if we say\n\nزَيْدٌ هَوَ مُنْطَلِقٌ\nZayd is setting out.\n\nThen the pronoun هُوَ refers to the noun زَيْدٌ which occurs before it.\nThere is a special pronoun, called the state-of-affairs pronoun (ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ) that behaves differently from other pronouns It is used to begin compound nounal sentences. Here is an example of a sentence with a state-of-affairs pronoun:\n\nهُوَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [معاني النحو 1/57]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is setting out.\n\nThe pronoun هُوَ is the state-of-affairs pronoun It is the subject of the outer sentence. Its info is the inner sentence زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ. What the state-of-affairs pronoun is referring to is explained by the entire sentence زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ that occurs after it.\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is typically used for statements that are momentous. Consider, for example, a situation where one hears some hubbub, and wonders, “What is the state of affairs that is causing this hubbub?” The answer to this question is:\n\nهُوَ الأَمِيرُ مُقْبِلٌ [شرح الرضي على الكافية 2/464]\nIt is: the commander is approaching.\n(the pronoun “it” is referring to “the state of affairs”.)\n\nThis pronoun is often left untranslated. So example (58) may simply be translated as The commander is approaching.\nHere are some rules and guidelines regarding the state-of-affairs pronoun:\n\nThe gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun\nIf the subject of the following sentence is masculine, then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the masculine pronoun هُوَ. And if the subject of the following sentence is feminine, then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the feminine pronoun هِيَ. Examples:\n\nهُوَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.\nهِيَ هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.\n\nAs mentioned, the gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun generally matches the gender of the following subject (as above). Sometimes, however, it is found to mismatch. For example:\n\nهِيَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.\nهُوَ هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745–756]\n[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.\n\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun, regardless of whether the subject of the following subject is singular, dual, or plural.11\n\nهُوَ الزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ\n[The state of affairs] is: the two Zayds are standing.\nهِيَ الْهِنْدَاتُ قَائِمَاتٌ\n[The state of affairs] is: the Hinds are standing.\n\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun for the absentee person\nEven if the subject of the inner sentence is a pronoun for the speaker or adressee persons, the state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun of for the absentee person. For example:\n\nهُوَ أَنَا زَيْدٌ [معاني النحو 1/59]\n[The fact] is: I am Zayd.\n\nThe sentence أَنَا أَنَا زَيْدٌ is possible, but in this case the pronoun أَنَا is not a state-of-affairs pronoun. Rather it is repeated for emphasis.12\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronouns هُوَ and هِيَ only introduce nounal sentences\nThe state-of-affairs pronouns هُوَ and هِيَ only introduce nounal sentences.13 This can be seen in the examples above.\nWe will see, in sections (kaana) and (inna), that the state-of-affairs pronoun can also be used with كَانَ and إِنَّ (and its sisters). In these cases, the state-of-affairs pronoun may introduce verbal sentences. For example:\n\nفَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعۡمَى ٱلۡأَبۡصَـٰرُ [سورة الحج 22:46 cited by شرح الرضي على الكافية 2/467]\nFor indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded",

    "text": "2.2 The doer participle as a verb-like governor\nThe doer participle is the closest of the deverbal nouns to the verb, and thus the strongest of the deverbal nouns in its capacity to act as a verb-like governor.\nConsider the following sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd – he stands\n\nAs we know from chapter (ref), this is a compound sentence. زَيْدٌ is the subject of an outer sentence. The info of the outer sentence is the inner sentence يَقُومُ.\nInstead of using the stateful verb يَقُومُ, we can use its doer participle قَائِم, thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing\n\nAs you can see, we have translated the stateful verb يَقُومُ as stands and the doer participle قَائِم as standing. We will discuss the difference in meaning between the stateful verb and the doer participle in more detail in chapter (ref), if Allāh wills. For now, we will focus on the grammar of the two sentences.\nThere is one notable similarity between the grammar of examples (1) and (2), and one notable difference:\n\nThe similarity\nThe stateful verb يَقُومُ, and the doer participle قَائِمٌ both govern a latent doer pronoun, implicated as [هُوَ].\n\n\nThe difference\nThe stateful verb يَقُومُ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] are complementary structural elements that constitute a complete sentence. The latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is the structure-starter and the stateful verb يَقُومُ is the structure-completer. The sentence formed by the stateful verb يَقُومُ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the subject (زَيْدٌ) of the outer sentence.\nOn the other hand, and the doer participle قَائِمٌ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] are not complementary structural elements. Rather, قَائِمٌ (as the structure-completer) and زَيْدٌ (as the structure-starter) are complementary structural elements. This is a simple sentence, not a compound sentence. The latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is not the structural element of any sentence. But, despite being dispensable from the perspective of sentence completion, the latent doer pronoun is an essential governee of the doer participle.\nLet’s take a look at another example:\n\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا قَائِمًا\nI saw a standing man.\n\nThe structural elements of this sentence are رَأَيْتُ: the verb رَأَى and its doer pronoun تُ. The entire phrase رَجُلًا قَائِمًا has only dispensable elements. قَائِمًا is a attribute of رَجُلًا, governed by the verb رَأَى. The doer participle قَائِمًا has a latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] that refers back to رَجُلًا. But because قَائِمًا is a (dispensable) element of an existing sentence (whose structural elements are رَأَيْتُ), therefore it cannot be the structural structure-completer of a new sentence with its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ].\nSo, as you can see, whenever the doer participle has a latent doer pronoun, that doer pronoun is not the structure-starter of any sentence. This is because the doer participle, as a single element, is already a member of an existing sentence.\nIn contrast, a verb always forms a sentence (as the structure-completer) with its doer (as the structure-starter). If we replace the doer participle قَائِمًا with the verb يَقُومُ thus:\n\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا يَقُومُ\n\nthen يَقُومُ is a complete sentence with the verb and its latent doer pronoun as structural elements. This complete sentence is the attribute of رَجُلًا.",

    "section": "2.3 The doer participle as the governor of a latent doer pronoun",
    "text": "2.3 The doer participle as the governor of a latent doer pronoun\nLet us look into the latent doer pronoun of the doer participle in more detail. It makes sense for a verb to have a doer but how can a noun have a doer? The reason is that the doer participle, because of its closeness to the verb, can act like one. When acting with verbal force, it can govern a doer. It can also, as we will see soon, if Allāh wills, govern a direct doee.\nThe doer of the doer participle is, by default, a latent pronoun. And it refers back to a referent that occurs before it. In example (2) زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ the doer of the doer participle قَائِمٌ is the latent pronoun [هُوَ]. And the referent of this doer pronoun is the subject زَيْدٌ.\nDIAGRAM\nLet’s see another example:\n\nصَاحَ الرَّجُلُ الْقَائِمُ\nThe standing man shouted.\n\nthen الْقَائِمُ governs a latent doer pronoun [هُوَ], that refers back to الرَّجُلُ.\nThe fact that the doer participle has a latent doer pronoun is, in fact, the reason why a doer participle in the info will match the subject in gender.1\nFor example, if we say:\n\nهِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ\nHind is standing.\n\nthen the feminine marker ة is added to the doer participle قَائِم only because it has to match the feminine gender of the latent doer pronoun [هِيَ] that occurs with, and is governed by, the doer participle. (The latent doer pronoun [هِيَ] refers back to هِنْد.)\nWhen the referent of the latent doer pronoun changes for number or gender, then the latent doer pronoun will change to match it. For example:\n\nالزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/291]\nThe two Zayds are standing.\nالزَّيْدُونَ قَائِمُونَ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/291]\nThe Zayds are standing.\n\nIn example (7) above, the latent doer pronoun of قَائِمَانِ is implicated as هُمَا.\nAnd in example (8) the latent doer pronoun of قَائِمُونَ is implicated as هُمْ.\nAs a point of technicality, the alif in the dual suffix of قَائِمَانِ and the و in the plural suffix of قَائِمُونَ, are not themselves the doer pronouns.2 Rather, the doer pronouns for the doer participles above are latent.\nThis is different than for verbs. In the verbs يَقُومَانِ and يَقُومُونَ, the alif in انِ and the و in ونَ are, themselves, considered the doer pronouns. And these pronouns are overt, not latent.",

    "text": "2.4 The doer participle as the governor of a direct doee\nWe have seen that the doer participle, when acting with verbal force, governs a doer. In a similar manner, the doer participle for transitive verbs can, optionally, govern a direct doee. In order to introduce this behavior, we use again, as our starting point, the u-state stateful verb. Consider the following example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا\nZayd beats Amr\n\nExample (9) above is parsed as follows:\n\nزَيْدٌ is a subject.\nيَضْرِبُ is a stateful verb in the u-state. It governs a latent pronoun (implicated as هُوَ) in the u-state as its doer. The latent doer pronoun هُوَ refers back to its referent: the subject زَيْدٌ.\nعَمْرًا is a direct doee, governed in the a-state by the verb يَضْرِبُ.\nيَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا is an inner sentence which is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the subject زَيْدٌ.\n\nInstead of using the verb يَضْرِبُ in example (9) above we may instead use its doer participle ضَارِب, thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nExample (10) is parsed as follows:\n\nزَيْدٌ is a subject.\nضَارِبٌ is the info of the subject زَيْدٌ. It governs a latent pronoun (implicated as هُوَ) in the u-state as its doer. The latent doer pronoun هُوَ refers back to the subject زَيْدٌ.\nعَمْرًا is a direct doee, governed in the a-state by the doer participle ضَارِبٌ.\n\nAs you can see, the doer participle ضَارِبٌ can govern a direct doee just like the verb يَضْرِبُ.\nHowever, while a transitive verb can govern a direct doee unconditionally, a doer participle can only govern a direct doee if certain conditions are satisfied. We will discuss these conditions in section (ref) below.\nBy the way, we again highlight the difference in the doer of the verb يَضْرِبُ vs the doer of the doer participle ضَارِبٌ: The verb يَضْرِبُ and its doer are complementary structural pairs that constitute a complete sentence. Whereas, the doer participle ضَارِبٌ does not form a new sentence with its doer.\n\n2.4.1 A doer participle defined by ٱل as the governor of a direct doee\nExample (10) shows the government of a direct doee by an doer participle that is not defined by ٱل. In a similar manner, an doer participle that is defined by ٱل, can also govern a direct doee. For example:\n\nهَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/84]\nThis [person] is the beater of Zayd.\n\nBy the way, you my be wondering what is the difference between the sentence in example (11) هَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا above, and if we had used an annexation thus:\n\nهَذَا ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ This [person] is the beater of Zayd.\n\nThis is touched upon in section (ma3aani_ism_faa3il).\n\n\n2.4.2 Word order of the direct doee and its governing doer participle\nAs with verbs, the direct doee usually follows its governing doer participle (as in the examples above). But when an doer participle is not prefixed by ال, then its direct doee is allowed to precede it. So we can say:\n\nهذا زيدا ضارب [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/259]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd.\n\nWhile the direct doee is permitted to precede its governing doer participle (as above), it is very common, in such a case, for a strengthening-لِ to be used with an indirect doee instead, thus:\n\nهذا لِزيدٍ ضارب\nThis [person], to Zayd, is beating.\nلِلضَّيْفِ مُكْرِمٌ [Fischer 113]\nto the guest, is honoring\n(i.e. honoring the guest)\n\nThe strengthening-لِ is discussed in more detail in section (later chapter).3\nAlso, the freedom for the governee of a doer participle to precede it is only given to the doer participle not prefixed by ال. When an doer participle is prefixed by ال, then its direct doee is not allowed to precede it.4 So we cannot say:\n\n✗ هذا زيدا الضارب\n\nWe would have to say instead\n\n✓ هذا الضارب زيدا\n\nTODO: Fronting the direct doee is not permitted for participle-like adjective. See link in example above. Add to section on participle-like adjective\n\n\n2.4.3 A dual or plural doer participle as the governor of a direct doee\nA dual or plural doer participle may govern a direct doee just like the singular. So we can say:\n\nهذان ضاربان زيدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThese two [persons] are beating Zayd.\nهم ضاربون زيدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThese [persons] are beating Zayd.\nالهندات ضاربات عمرا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\n\nDoer participles defined by ٱل are again also permitted:\n\nهذان الضاربان زيدا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nThese two are the beaters of Zayd.\nهؤلاء الضاربون الرجل [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nThese are the beaters of the man.\nوَٱلۡمُقِیمِینَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَۚ وَٱلۡمُؤۡتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ [سورة النساء 4:162 cited by شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nAnd the establishers of prayer [especially] and the givers of zakāh\n\nFor plurals, the sound plurals are more worthy of being used as verb-like governors5 as in the examples above. However, broken plurals are permitted as well. So we can say:\n\nالزيدون ضُرّابٌ عمرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهِنْداتُ ضواربُ عَمْرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\n\nFlexible word order is again permitted for the dual and the plural as it was for the singular:\n\nالزيدان عمرا ضاربان [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe two Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالزيدون عَمْرًا ضُرّابٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهندات عمرا ضاربات [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهِنْداتُ عَمْرًا ضواربُ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.",

    "section": "2.5 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee",
    "text": "2.5 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee\nAs we mentioned above, there are conditions that must be satisfied in order for an doer participle to be able to govern a direct doee in this manner. The conditions are different for when the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ, and when it is not defined by ٱلْ. We will discuss each of these cases separately below:\n\n2.5.1 When the doer participle is not defined by ٱلْ\nWhen the doer participle is not defined by ٱلْ, then two conditions must be satisfied:\n\nThe verbal aspect of the doer participle must be imperfect. That is, it must indicate an ongoing (whether present or past) or future action. Examples:\n\npresent ongoing:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا الآن [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd now.\n\npast ongoing:\n\nكان زيد ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd was beating Ɛamr.\nوَكَلْبُهُمْ بَاسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بَٱلْوَصِيدِ [سورة الكهف 18:18 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nwhile their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance\n\nfuture:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا غَدًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] will beat Zayd tomorrow.\n\n\nIf the verbal aspect indicated by the doer participle is perfect, then the doer participle may not govern a direct doee. So, for example, we cannot say:\n\n✗ هذا ضارب زيدا أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] beat Zayd yesterday.\n\nIf we desire to use the doer participle, then it will not have verbal force. And زَيْد will have to be a base noun in a annexation. Furthermore, this annexation will be real (see chapter (ref)).\n\nهذا ضارب زيد أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.\n\nAn exception is made for for transitive verbs that take more than one direct doee, like جعل, أَعطى, etc. When the doer participle of such a verb is annexed to what would have been the first direct doee, then second direct doee is permitted to be in the a-state, even if the aspect is perfect.6 For example:\n\nهذا معطي زيد أمس درهما [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/78]\nThis [person] was the giver of Zayd, yesterday, a dirham.\n\nEven the first direct doee may remain in the a-state, if separated from the doer participle. For example:\n\nهذا ظان أمس زيدا فاضلا [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/78]\nThis [person] was the believer, yesterday, of Zayd as an eminent person.\n\nThe second condition that should be satisfied is that the doer participle must have governing support. This governing support can be provided by the following means:\n\nThe doer participle occurs after a question word. Example:\n\nأضارب زيد عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nIs Zayd beating Ɛamr?\nهَلْ مُكْرِمٌ أَنْتَ زَيْدًا [Wright 2/65D]\nWill you be treating Zayd with respect?\n\nThe doer participle occurs after a vocative particle: Example:\n\nيا طالعا جبلا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nO scaler [of] a mountain!\n\nThe doer participle occurs in a negation: Example:\n\nما ضارب زيد عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd is not beating Ɛamr.\nمَا أَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ [سورة البقرة 2:145 cited by Wright 2/65D]\nNor will you be a follower of their qiblah\nمَا مُجِيرٌ أَحَدٌ عَدُوَّ أَحِبَّاءِهِ [Wright 2/65D]\nNo one gives protection to the enemy of his loved ones\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a attribute. Example:\n\nمررت برجل ضارب زيدا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI passed by a man beating Zayd.\nمَرَرْتُ بِفَارِسٍ طَالِبٍ ثَأْرَ أَبِيهِ [Wright 2/65C]\nI passed by a horseman (who was) seeking vengeance for (the murder of) his father\n\nAn implied attribute is also considered permissible. Example:\n\nكَمْ مَالِئٍ عَيْنَيْهِ مِنْ شَيْءِ غَيْرِهِ [Wright 2/65C; شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/108]\nHow many a one fills his eyes with a thing of [someone] other than him\n(i.e. كَمْ شَخْصٍ مَالِئٍ How many a person fills…)\nكَنَاطِحٍ صَخْرَةً يَوْمًا لِيُوهِنَهَا [Wright 2/65C; شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/109]\nLike the gorer of a rock, one day, to try to weaken it\n(i.e. كَوَعِلٍ نَاطِحٍ like a goring mountain goat…)\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a ḥāl. Example:\n\nجاء زيد راكبا فرسا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd came riding a horse.\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a info. Example:\n\nزيد ضارب عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd is beating Ɛamr.\n\nWe will learn in later chapters, if Allāh wills, different forms of infos. The following examples show these different forms, with references to the later chapters.\n\nكان زيد ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd was beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (kaana).)\nإن زيدا ضارب عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nIndeed Zayd is beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (inna).)\nظننت زيدا ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI thought Zayd [was] beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (zanna).)\nأعلمت زيدا عمرا ضاربا بكرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI let Zayd know Ɛamr is beating Bakr.\n(See chapter (zanna).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 When the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ\nWhen the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ, then it is permitted to govern a direct doee for a perfect or imperfect aspect.  Furthermore, no governing support is required for it to be a governor,7 (as was required for the doer participle without ٱلْ in section (ref) above).\nSo we can say:\n\nجاء الضارب زيداً أمسِ أو الآن أو غداً [شرح شذور الذهب للجوجري 2/683]\nThe beater of Zayd came yesterday/today/tomorrow",

    "section": "2.6 The doer participle as the governor of an overt doer pronoun",
    "text": "2.6 The doer participle as the governor of an overt doer pronoun\nThe latent doer pronoun becomes overt in some circumstances. In this section, we will discuss one such circumstance. Consider the sentence:\n\nالفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه [النحو الوافي 1/463]\n\nThis grammar is parsed as follows:\n\nالْفَارِسُ is the subject of the outer sentence.\nالْحِصَانُ is a second subject. It is the subject of the inner sentence.\nمُتْبِع is the info of the inner sentence. It is also a annexe noun.\nThe pronoun هُ is a base noun.\nThe inner sentence الْحِصَانُ مُتْبِعُهُ is the info of the subject (الْفَارِسُ) of outer sentence.\n\nThe info of the inner sentence مُتْبِع one who makes tired has a latent doer pronoun, implicated as [هُوَ]. It is possible for this latent doer pronoun to refer to either الْفَارِسُ or الْحِصَانُ. Let’s discuss both these meanings:\n\nIf the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] in مُتْبِع refers to الْحِصَانُ then the meaning is that the horse makes the horseman tired. In this case, the pronoun هُ in مُتْبِعُهُ refers to الْفَارِسُ.\nAnd if the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] in مُتْبِع refers to الْفَارِسُ then the meaning is that the horseman makes the horse tired. In this case, the pronoun هُ in مُتْبِعُهُ refers to الْحِصَانُ.\n\nBoth meanings are possible.\nIf only the second meaning is desired, then the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] can be made overt and added after the doer participle مُتْبِع, thus:\n\nالفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه هُوَ [النحو الوافي 1/464]\nThe horseman – the horse – [he] makes him tired.\n(i.e. The horseman makes the horse tired.)\n\nNow only the second meaning is possible. If the first meaning is desired, the doer pronoun of مُتْبِع must stay latent and the ambiguity will remain.\nBy the way, the ambiguity arose in the original sentence (الفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه) only because both subjects (الْفَارِسُ and الْحِصَانُ) are singular masculine nouns. If the two subjects are distinguishable in number or gender then there will be no ambiguity. However, even in this case, according to some grammarians, if the info is to refer to the subject of the outer sentence, then the doer pronoun of the doer participle in the info should be made overt. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا هُوَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/207]\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)\n\nBut according to other grammarians, because ضَارِب can refer only to Zayd and not to Hind, the doer participle’s doer pronoun can remain latent,8 thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)",

    "section": "2.7 The sababi info",
    "text": "2.7 The sababi info\n\nConsider again example (9) زَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا. From this original sentence, we replaced the verb يَضْرِبُ with its doer participle and came up with (10) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا.\nNow consider the following example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا\nZayd – his father beats Ɛamr\n\nIn example (58) above the doer of يَضْرِبُ is not Zayd but Zayd’s father. If we use this sentence as our starting point, we can again replace the verb يَضْرِبُ with its doer participle ضَارِبٌ and say:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا\nZayd – his father is beating Ɛamr\n\nأَبُوهُ is the (overt) doer of the doer participle ضَارِبٌ. And عَمْرًا is its direct doee. So just like a verb can have an overt noun as its doer instead of a latent pronoun, so too can the doer participle have an overt noun as its doer instead of a latent pronoun.\nAgain, there is one important difference between using the verb يَضْرِبُ vs using its doer participle ضَارِبٌ. And that is that يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا in example (58) is a complete sentence. This inner sentence is the info of the outer sentence. Therefore, example (58) is a compound sentence.\nHowever, ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا in example (59) is not a complete sentence. ضَارِبٌ itself, as a single word, is the info of the subject زَيْدٌ.9 So example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا is not a compound sentence.\n\nThe info ضَارِبٌ in example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا is called a sababi info.10 A deverbal noun is termed sababi when it governs a doer which is annexed to a pronoun that refers back to the original referent of the deverbal noun.11 In our example, the deverbal noun ضَارِبٌ governs a doer أَب which is annexed to a pronoun هُ that refers back to the original referent of the deverbal noun, the subject زَيْد.\n\n\n2.7.1 Varying the number or gender of the overt doer of the sababi info\nHere is another example of a sentence with a sababi info:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبُوهُ [Peled, Sentence types 208]\nZayd – his father was setting out.\n\nIn example (60) above, مُنْطَلِقًا is the sababi info of كَانَ. The overt doer of the مُنْطَلِقًا is the singular masculine noun أَبُوه his father.\nLet’s see what happens when we vary the number or gender of this overt doer of the sababi info.\n\nكَانَ الزَيْدَانِ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبَوَاهُمَا [Peled, Sentence types 208]\nThe two Zayds – their fathers were setting out.\n\nIn example (61) above, the sababi info مُنْطَلِقًا remains in the singular, even though its doer is the dual أَبَوَاهُمَا.\nThis is analagous to a verb, which remains in the singular for dual and plural doers. For example كَانَ الزَيْدَانِ يَنْطَلِقُ أَبَوَاهُمَا, etc.\nIf the gender of the doer participle’s doer is feminine, then the doer participle remains in the singular but it is feminized. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةٌ أُمُّهُ\nZayd – his mother is setting out.\nكَانَتْ هِنْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةً خَالَتَاهَا\nHind – her two maternal aunts were setting out.\n\nThis again is analagous to the feminizing a verb that has a feminine doer.\nIf the doer of the doer participle is a plural, then we have an choice:\nIf the doer participle has a sound plural, then, again, it is not used and the doer participle remains in the singular. For example:\n\nكَانَ الزَيْدُونَ مُنْطَلِقًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nThe Zayds – their fathers were setting out.\nزَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةٌ خَالَاتُهُ\nZayd – his maternal aunts are setting out.\n\nBut if the doer participle has a broken plural, then it is allowed to be used, and is indeed preferred,12 when the doer is a plural.\nFor example:\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ قِيَامًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nThe Zayds – their fathers were standing\n\nHere are some examples of sababi infos from the Qurʾān:\n\nفَإِنَّهُۥۤ ءَاثِمࣱ قَلۡبُهُۥۗ [سورة البقرة 2:283]\nhis heart is indeed sinful\n(Other analyses besides a sababi info are also possible.13 One such differing analysis is discussed in section (ref) below.)\nوَظَنُّوۤا۟ أَنَّهُم مَّانِعَتُهُمۡ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ [سورة الحشر 59:2]\nand they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh\n(Another analysis is also possible: حُصُونُهُمْ can be a subject, and مَانِعَتُهُمْ is its fronted info.14)\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Word order of the doer and the direct doee in a sababi info\nIf the doer participle is transitive, then the normal word order is doer participle, doer, direct doee. For example:\n\nهَذَا ضَارب أَبوهُ زيدا [الهمع للسيوطي 3/89]\nThis [person] – his father is beating Zayd.\n\nBut the direct doee can be made to precede the doer thus:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا أبوه [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 2/453]\nThis [person] – his father is beating Zayd.",

    "section": "2.8 The sababi attribute",
    "text": "2.8 The sababi attribute\nIn section (ref) above we have seen how a doer participle can govern a overt doer when it is a sababi info. In a similar manner, a doer participle can govern a overt doer when it is a sababi attribute.\nConsider the following example:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَبُوهُ\nI passed by a man whose father is setting out\n\nThe doer participle مُنْطَلِقٍ is a attribute of the attributee رَجُلٍ. Because it is a sababi attribute, it has a doer أَب that is annexed to a pronoun هُ which refers to the attributee رَجُلٍ.\nWe know that, in general, a attribute will match its attributee in four aspects:\n\nstate\ndefiniteness\ngender\nnumber (singular/dual/plural)\n\nThe sababi attribute will also match its preceding attributee in state and definiteness. (You can see the attribute مُنْطَلِقٍ matches its attributee رَجُلٍ in the i-state and in being indefinite.) But in matching gender and number the sababi attribute has different rules. Consistent with we learned for the sababi info above, the sababi attribute will, in general, always be singular, and it will match its doer in gender. Here are some examples that show different combinations:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِالرَّجُلِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَبُوهُ\nI passed by the man whose father is setting out.\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَخَوَاهُ\nI passed by a man whose two brothers are setting out.\nرَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا مُنْطَلِقًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nI saw men whose fathers are setting out.\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْطَلِقَةً أُمُّهُ\nI saw a man whose mother is setting out.\nجَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ الْمُنْطَلِقَةُ أَخَوَاتُهُ\nZayd whose sisters are setting out came to me.\nجَاءَتْنِي امْرَأَةٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهَا\nA woman whose father is setting out came to me.\nمَرَرْتُ بِالْمَرْأَةِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَخَوَاهَا\nI passed by the woman whose two brothers are setting out.\n\nThe above examples use the doer participle مُنْطَلِق which only has sound plurals. Therefore it remains in the singular. If an doer participle has a broken plural, it is permitted (and in fact preferred) to use the broken plural for a plural doer.15 Examples:\n\nمَرَرْت بِرِجَال قيام آباؤهم [شرح قطر الندى وبل الصدى 288]\nI passed by men whose fathers are standing.\nمَرَرْت برجل قعُود غلمانه [شرح قطر الندى وبل الصدى 288]\nI passed by a man whose slave-boys are sitting\n(Note that the attributee رَجُل is singular in this case.)\n\nSome more aspects of gender agreement of the sababi doer with its governing deverbal noun will be discussed in section (sifah_mush sababi na3t), if Allāh wills.",

    "section": "2.10 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer",
    "text": "2.10 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer\nIn section (ref) above, we discussed the conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee. Correspondingly, there exist conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer.\nThe doer participle can have either an overt doer (either as a noun or as a pronoun), or a latent doer pronoun. We will treat each of these separately below:\n\n2.10.1 Conditions for the doer participle to govern an overt doer\nThe grammarians differed with regard to the conditions under which the doer participle is allowed to govern an overt doer. According to some, the same conditions are applicable as for governing a direct doee, namely that when an doer participle is not defined by ٱل, then it can only govern an overt doer when\n\nIt has an imperfect aspect.\nIt has governing support\n\nSo it is not allowed to govern an overt doer for a perfect aspect. The following example would then be disallowed:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ أَمْسِ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 134]\nZayd – his father stood yesterday.\n\nOther grammarians, however, allowed such a sentence.16\nwhen an doer participle is defined by ٱل, then it can only govern an overt doer unconditionally. So it can govern with perfective aspect and without governing support. Examples:\n\nجاءني القائم أبوه [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 1/449]\nThe one whose father is standing came.\nالقائم أبوه ضاحك [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 3/257]\nThe one whose father is standing is laughing.\nجاء الضارب أبوه زيدًا أمس [شرح ابن الناظم على ألفية ابن مالك 59]\nThe one whose father beat Zayd yesterday came.\n\n\n\n2.10.2 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a latent doer pronoun\nAs a default, the doer participle requires a latent doer pronoun. So it governs a latent doer pronoun unconditionally, except when it is prevented from doing so because of one of the following situations:\n\nThe doer participle is already governing an overt doer noun\nIf the doer participle is already governing an overt doer, then it will not also have a latent doer pronoun. This is because one doer participle cannot have two doers.17 Example:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 139]\nZayd – his father is standing\n\nBeware though, that sometimes it may appear that an doer participle is governing an overt doer, but actually another interpretation may also be possible. Consider the following āyah that we discussed in section (ref) above:\n\nفَإِنَّهُۥۤ ءَاثِمࣱ قَلۡبُهُۥۗ [سورة البقرة 2:283]\nhis heart is indeed sinful\n\nWe had discussed this as a case of a sababi info. But another analysis is also possible: The doer participle آثِمٌ is governing a latent doer pronoun, and قَلْبُهُ is a sub for the latent doer pronoun.18\n\n\nThe doer participle is already governing an overt doer pronoun\nWe discussed in section (ref) above, a situation in which the originally latent doer pronoun of a doer participle becomes overt. Because the doer is now overt the doer participle will not govern an additional latent doer.19\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا هُوَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/207]\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)\n\n\n\nThe doer participle is the annexe noun in a real annexation\nWhen doer participle is the annexe noun in a real annexation, then it will not govern a latent doer pronoun.20 This can happen when the doer participle indicates a perfective aspect. We saw an example of this in the conditions for governing a direct doee above:\n\nهذا ضارب زيد أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.\n\nBy the way, this does not mean that the doer participle cannot govern a latent doer pronoun whenever it signifies a perfective aspect. It only cannot do so in a real annexation. So doer participle will govern a latent doer pronoun when it has a perfective aspect, but no annexation. For example:\n\nهذا ضاربٌ أمس\nThis [person] was a beater yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun\nWhen the doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun (see section (ref) below), then, in general, it does not govern a latent doer pronoun.21. For example:\n\n\nزَيْدٌ صَاحِبٌ\nZayd is a companion\n\nBut even for entity nouns, the the latent doer pronoun can re-emerge when needed (see section (sec-the-doer-participle-crossover-to-substantive-as-a-attribute)).",

    "text": "2.11 Superficial annexation\n\nSuperficial annexation used to eliminate tanwīn\nConsider again the sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا\nzaydun ḍāribun 3amran\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nThe doer participle ضَارِبٌ has a tanwīn which is pronounced before pronouncing the direct doee عَمْرًا. In an effort to make the pronunciation easier, this tanwīn is often eliminated and replaced with an annexation. The direct doee is then made into a base noun in the i-state. The meaning remains the same. So the above sentence then becomes:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو\nzaydun ḍāribu 3amrin\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nThis is called a superficial annexation, as opposed to a real annexation, which is what we have been studying so far. This is because it is only an annexation for the purposes of easing the pronunciation, not in meaning.\nRegarding terminology, عَمْرٍو syntactically becomes a base noun in the superficial annexation. But in meaning, it is still the direct doee of the doer participle ضَارِب. We will refer to it as the semantic direct doee.\nBy the way, the sentence زَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو can also be a real annexation. In which case, the meaning will be: Zayd is the beater of Ɛamr. So if we come across such a sentence, how can we tell if it is a real annexation or a superficial annexation? The answer is, in this case, context should guide us. We will see below that the superficial annexation is not always identical in form to the real annexation. So in those cases, the form of the annexation will tell us whether it is a real annexation or a superficial annexation.\nHere are some more examples of a superficial annexation used to eliminate a tanwīn:\n\nالْهِنْدَاتُ ضارباتُ عمرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضارباتٌ عمرًا)\n\nWhen the doer participle is a semi-flexible, it will not have a tanwīn. But the superficial annexation may still be used in such a case because a tanwīn would have been present if the word were fully-flexible.22 For example:\n\nالْهِنْدَاتُ ضواربُ عَمْرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضواربُ عمرًا)\n\n\n\nSuperficial annexation used to eliminate the ن of a dual or plural suffix\nThe superficial annexation is used in situations when the governing doer participle has tanwīn (as above), and also in situations when it ends with a ن arising from a dual or sound plural. Examples:\n\nالزَّيْدَانِ ضاربا عَمْرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe [two] Zayds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضاربانِ عَمْرًا)\n\n\n\nDefiniteness of the superficial annexation\nBecause this is a superficial and not a real annexation, the annexe noun is not made definite by a definite base noun. In the examples so far, the base nouns have been proper nouns (زَيْد, عَمْرو) which are definite. But the doer participles (ضَارِب, ضَارِبَا, etc.) remain indefinite, because they did not originally have ٱل when governing a direct doee. This example proves the above claim:\n\nهَدۡیَۢا بَـٰلِغَ ٱلۡكَعۡبَةِ [سورة المائدة 5:95 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/84]\nas an offering [to Allāh] delivered to the Kaʿbah\n\nIn example (93) above, the doer participle بَالِغ is a annexe noun to the definite base noun الْكَعْبَة. But this is a superficial annexation. So بَالِغ does not become definite. Therefore بَالِغ can be a attribute to the indefinite هَدْيًا.\nIf the doer participle is to be made definite in a superficial annexation then a ٱل is added to it. For example:\n\nهذان الضاربا زيدٍ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nThese two are the beaters of Zayd.\n(instead of هذان الضاربان زيدًا)\nوَٱلۡمُقِیمِی ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ [سورة الحج 22:35 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nand the establishers of prayer\n\nAdding ٱل to the annexe noun is particular to a superficial annexation. As we know, it is not permitted in a real annexation. So when we see ٱل with a annexe noun, then we will know that the annexation has to be a superficial one.\n\n\nWhen the doer participle does not have tanwīn or a suffixed ن\nConsider the following case of a doer participle governing a direct doee:\n\nالضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا\nthe beater of Zayd\n\nThere is no tanwīn of suffixed ن after the doer participle. Therefore, a superficial annexation is not permitted, and we cannot say:\n\n✗ الضَّارِبُ زَيْدٍ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\n\nThe following are similarly not permitted:\n\n✗ الضارب رجلٍ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beater of the man\n✗ الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/66B] the beater of the slave of Zayd\n✗ الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِهِ [Wright 2/66B] the beater of his slave\n\nIf, however, the direct doee is defined by ٱل, or is itself a annexe noun to a base noun that is defined by ٱل, then, as an exception, the superficial annexation is again permitted.23 For example:\n\nالضَّارِبُ الْعَبْدِ [Wright 2/66A]\nthe beater of the slave\nالضَّارِبُ رَأْسِ الْعَبْدِ [Wright 2/66A]\nthe beater of the head of the slave\n\n\n\nالضَّارِبُ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nthe beater of the man\nالضَّوَارِبُ/الضُّرَّابُ/الضَّارِبَاتُ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beaters of the man\nالضَّوَارِبُ/الضُّرَّابُ/الضَّارِبَاتُ غُلَامِ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beaters of the slave-boy of the man\n\n\n\nTwo or more direct doees connected by وَ or أَوْ\nWhen a doer participle governs two or more direct doees connected by وَ or أَوْ then, if the first is in a superficial annexation then the second may either be in the i-state or the a-state. For example\n\nهذا ضاربُ زيدٍ وعمرٍو/وعمرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/81]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd and Ɛamr\n\nBy the way, if the first direct doee is in the a-state, then it is not an annexation and the second direct doee would follow in the a-state.\n\nهذا ضاربٌ زيدًا وعمرًا\nThis [person] is beating Zayd and Ɛamr\n\n\n\nSuperficial annexation with a overt doer\nConsider an doer participle that has a overt doer and is governing a direct doee thus:\n\n\nمررت برجل ضارب أبوه زيدا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/458]\nI passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.\n\nIf we wish to use a superficial annexation, then the doer participle can only be annexed to its direct doee and not to its doer. So we can say:\n\nمررت برجل ضارب زيد أبوه [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/74]\nI passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.\n(Remember from section (ref) above that the word order ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا أَبُوهُ is permissible.)\n\nWe cannot say:\n\n✗ مررت برجل ضارب أَبِيهِ زيدا [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 10/359]",

This would permit words like: ضَارِبُنِي, الضَّارِبُونِي, etc. For example:\n\nفَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ صَادِقُونِي فِيهِ 24 [https://hadithunlocked.com/nasai-kubra:11291]\nSo will you tell me the truth about it?\n\nIt seems that this usage did not make its way to Standard Classical Arabic.

    "section": "2.15 The doer of a deverbal noun that fulfils the role of the info",
    "text": "2.15 The doer of a deverbal noun that fulfils the role of the info\nIn our discussion of the doer of deverbal nouns, we have consistently stated that the doer of a deverbal noun is not a structural element. This is because the deverbal noun, which has a doer, is typically already part of an existing sentence. See example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا above.\nHowever, there is one special kind of sentence where that the doer of a deverbal noun is a structural element.\nBefore presenting this special doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentence, we will first give some background. Consider the sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nIn example (127) above, زَيْدٌ is the subject and قَائِمٌ is its info.\nWe can rearrange the word order to front the info thus:\n\nقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ\nStanding, Zayd is.\n\nThis fronted info will be common in negative and question sentences. For example:\n\nأَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/257B]\nIs Zayd standing?\nمَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ [Wright 2/257B]\nHind is not going\n\nNow we come to the special doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentence:\nIn negative and question sentences like examples (129) and (129) above, the deverbal noun can be analyzed as a subject, and its following doer will fulfil the role of the info.\nSo, in examples (129) and (129) above, قَائِمٌ can be considered a subject زَيْدٌ and can be its doer that fulfils the role of the info. Now, you might be thinking: what is the reason for this strange doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis?\nWhy can’t we just consider قَائِمٌ a fronted info and زَيْدٌ the backed subject?\nThe answer is that we can indeed consider قَائِمٌ a fronted info and زَيْدٌ the backed subject as one option. But, as another option, the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis allows us to keep the deverbal noun in the singular for dual and plural subjects. So we can say:\n\nأَقَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ\nAre the two Zayds standing?\nمَا ذَاهِبَةٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are not going\n\nSentences (131) and (132) are legitimate, but are only permitted for negative and question sentences.26 If it is not a negative or question sentence, then the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info construction is not permitted. So the following are not correct as complete sentences:\n\n✗ قَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ\nThe two Zayds are standing.\n✗ ذَاهِبَةٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are going\n\nThis is because the deverbal noun قَائِم cannot govern the overt doers الزَّيْدَانِ and الْهِنْدَاتُ without the governing support that is provided by being in a negative or question sentence.\nSo when it is not a negative or question sentence, then only the fronted info construction is permitted and the info will typically match the backed subject in number and gender. For example:\n\nقَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ\nStanding, the two Zayds are.\nذَاهِبَاتٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nGoing, the Hinds are.\n\nThe fronted info construction is also permitted, as an option, even for negative and question sentences. For example:\n\nأَقَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ\nAre the two Zayds standing?\nمَا ذَاهِبَاتٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are not going\n\nWhen the deverbal noun and the doer are both singular, and it is a negative or question sentence, then a double analysis is possible27:\n\nthe fronted info analysis\nthe doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis\n\nSuch is the case in examples (129) أَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ and (130) مَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ above.\nHere are some more examples of doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentences:\n\nهَلْ مَضْرُوبٌ بَنُوكَ [Wright 2/257C]\nAre your sons beaten?\n(بَنُو is a deputy doer.)\nأَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنۡ ءَالِهَتِی یَـٰۤإِبۡرَ ٰ⁠هِیمُۖ [سورة مريم 19:46 cited by Wright 2/257D]\nHave you no desire for my gods, O Abraham?\n(A double analysis is reportedly possible, but the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis is preferred.28)\nخَلِيلَيَّ مَا وَافٍ بِعَهْدِي أَنْتُمَا [Wright 2/257D]\nMy two friends, you are not keeping my promise.\nأَمُنْجِزٌ أَنْتُمْ وَعْدًا وَثِقْتُ بِهِ [Wright 2/257D]\nAre you fulfiling a promise that I put my trust on?",
