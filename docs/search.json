    "text": "Work in progress.\n\nNot ready for study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTHIS BOOK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS INCOMPLETE AND MAY HAVE TYPOGRAPHICAL AND OTHER ERRORS. IT IS NOT YET READY FOR STUDY.\n\n\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary texts of Islām (the Qurʾān and the Ḥadīt͡h) are in Arabic. So too is much of its scholarly literature. However, there are many Muslims for whom Arabic is not a native language, yet who are familiar enough with English to study textbooks written in this language. The goal of this book is to help them learn Arabic so that, together with a study of the appropriate expositional texts, they can start to understand the primary texts in their original language. We hope that this will, if Allāh wills, make them more connected to the primary texts and their teachings. Furthermore, they can be empowered to study the vast body of Arabic Islāmic literature.\n\nRegarding the title of this book: the Arab grammarians were describing the Arabic language of the time of the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. They were doing this by drawing upon a corpus that included transmitted texts and the dialectal speech of informants. We term the language of this corpus to be Classical Arabic, because of its considerable volume and its agreed upon significance and eloquence. In the process of the grammarians’ sifting through and describing the dialectal variation of Classical Arabic, a standard variety emerged and gained prevalence. Thenceforth, virtually all composed texts attempted to conform to the grammar of this standard. And it is the grammar of this Standard Classical Arabic (sca) that is the subject of this work.\nsca, as a standard, is not exactly defined in its entirety. There is a core which is more or less agreed upon, and then there are fringe dialectal, rare, and anomalous usages, regarding whose acceptability the grammarians have differed. We have attemped to convey both these aspects when the occasion has demanded it.\nWhile the grammar which we cover in this book is of sca, the vocabulary may include legitimate post-classical words and meanings. But we stop short of dealing with Modern Standard Arabic (msa). Because the preponderance of its modern vocabulary would detract from the main focus of this book. And also because Western grammar works which focus on msa tend to use modern texts as a corpus to re-describe and re-codify its grammar. Which is fine, as a methodology, because their goal is to understand the meaning of msa texts. If we were to include msa, as thus defined, in this book, then we would have to explain the conflicts between it and sca. Which is something we are not ready, or equipped, to deal with.\n\nThis book is a learning or teaching grammar, as opposed to being strictly a reference grammar. Therefore, whenever we were able to, we have tried to explain topics, and give examples, in a manner that assumes an understanding of only preceding content. We have, at the same time, generally tried to group content coherently for convenient reference during learning.\nWe have also aimed to make this a self-instruction textbook so that a diligent student should, if Allāh wills, be able to study it independently. The target learner is someone who has not been exposed to grammatical terminology beyond a grade school level. While terminology is necessary for a rigorous non-immersive learning of language, we have tried to steer away from Latin-based terms like accusative, jussive, etc. Such terms, when first encountered by an uninitiated learner, may deter him from proceeding further. So we have in some places translated the meaning of Arabic grammar terms to English. In other places, we have used established English grammar terms where the terms are basic enough. We have even, in places, invented terms where we deemed appropriate. We have also used some grammatical terminology from Arabic directly, usually in cases where our target learner may have already been exposed to them from Qurʾān recitation rules, or where the term is complex enough that creating a term specifically in English wouldn’t make it any simpler. The drawback to this non-standard approach, however, is that the student may not be able to immediately relate the terminology he has learned in this book to established terminology in other grammar textbooks. To remedy this to some extent, we provide a glossary which maps the grammatical terminology used in this book to other, established, Latin-based and Arabic-based counterparts.\n\n\nBecause this is an instructional textbook, we have generally avoided quoting verbatim when drawing material from cited sources, But we haven’t shied away from sticking close to the cited text when we felt we could not better its expression or organization for our purposes. Citations are absent for basic topics, and also where we were not able to find an exact reference for some point that we are trying to make.  In any event, any errors that remain in this book are our own.\n\n\nTechnical matters\n\nThis book is produced using the Quarto authoring and publishing framework and set in the Charis, Vazirmatn, Kitab, and Amiri typefaces.\nUnless otherwise indicated, translations from the Qurʾān are by Ṣaḥeeḥ International™, sourced from https://quran.com.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the numbering of Ḥadīt͡h is that used by https://sunnah.com.\nThe page numbers for citations may vary across different editions and publishers. We have attempted to specify the edition that we are using in the references.\n\nthe authors",

    "text": "1.1 History of Arabic\nAll praises are due to Allāh. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allāh from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds. Whomever Allāh guides, no one can mislead. Whomever Allāh leads astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except Allāh. I also bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and messenger.\nMay the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon the Prophet Muḥammad, his family, his companions, and those who followed them with good conduct.\nAllāh, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the Qurʾān, some fourteen and a half centuries ago, to the Prophet Muḥammad, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Qurʾān is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. Also, composed in this Arabic language, was a vast body of poetry that the Arabs would consider eloquent and worth transmitting. We will call the Arabic of this pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic era as Classical Arabic.1 The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken by the different tribes and in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula.\nAll languages change naturally over time. For example, English has changed to such a degree that the Old English language spoken 1400 years ago would be unintelligible to us today. So too did the Classical Arabic dialects begin to change. But when this began to happen, scholars took on the responsibility of preserving the language of the revelation.2 In the process of preserving Classical Arabic, one particular variety became standardized and gained prevalence as a literary language amongst the dialects of Classical Arabic. We will call this variety Standard Classical Arabic (sca).\nsca became the language of religious scholarship, science, and literature in the Islāmic world. As scholars developed new branches of religious and secular sciences, new terms and meanings were added (which are termed post-classical). A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages and Arabicized, as needed by the different scientific disciplines. Even Classical Arabic itself had a few Arabicized foreign borrowings from neighboring languages.\nWhile sca was used for literary purposes, the vernacular language that was spoken by Arabs in their day-to-day lives continued to evolve naturally over time and in the different regions where Arabic was spoken. And so, there began to exist two very distinct types of Arabic: the preserved sca which is taught by formal education and which is primarily a written language, and the vernacular Arabic dialects which Arabs learn as their mother tongue and which are primarily only spoken and not written.\nIn modern times, many new words and meanings were added to sca, often via translation from Western languages, to keep up with technological advancements and modern media. This modern development of sca is called Modern Standard Arabic (msa).\nThe figure below presents a simplified view the historical development of the different varieties of Arabic.\nIn the figure above, the extraction of sca towards the end of the Classical Arabic period does not imply that only later stages of Classical Arabic contributed to sca. Rather, it only implies that that is when sca emerged as the standard literary language for non-native Classical Arabic users. In fact, the source material for sca includes not only the speech of contemporary native Classical Arabic speakers, but also transmitted texts from throughout the Classical Arabic period, even texts from before the time of the Prophet ﷺ.\nNor does the diagram intend to imply that only sca was preserved amongst all the dialects of Classical Arabic. sca is the variety of Classical Arabic which became a standard that continued to be used later. But the scholars of the Arabic language made notes regarding the other dialects of Classical Arabic as well.",

    "text": "1.2 What defines sca\n\nIt may be appropriate to say a few words about what defines sca proper. When the Arab grammarians first began recording and describing Classical Arabic, the regular, day-to-day, speech of many people had already begun to deviate from Classical Arabic. So the grammarians would seek out and record samples of speech and texts from only authoritative sources. And they had criteria for determining what constituted an authority in the language. One such criterion was that the text sample be native Classical Arabic speech. What we mean by “native Classical Arabic” is the language produced by persons immersed from early childhood in an environment where they would hear (native) Classical Arabic from people around them in their day-to-day lives, such that they learned to speak it naturally, without discernable change.3\nBy the time sca was emerging as a standard for literary output, Classical Arabic was on the decline, as a native language. Most literary output produced in sca was then a non-native attempt to conform to the standard. So, even though proficiency in sca was generally pretty high, books written in sca are not themselves, generally, definitive of sca.",

    "text": "1.3 msa\nAs we have mentioned earlier, sca when produced today will tend to have a lot of modern vocabulary, and will generally be referred to as msa. msa is used today as the language of published literature and formally produced news media.\nmsa, in theory, still attempts to conform to the grammar of sca. In practice, however, msa is influenced  noticeably by European languages. This is because much written material, like books and news articles was, and is, translated wholesale from European languages. This translation, along with adding vocabulary, has also influenced the style, and also in places, the grammar of the msa which you are likely to find printed today.  That is not to say that all msa produced today has deviated from the grammar and style of sca. Persons who have been more exposed to classical books are more likely to stay closer to sca. In any case, as we have mentioned earlier, all Arabic that is produced today that attempts to conform to sca, is merely that: an attempt to conform to sca, and not definitive of sca.\nAs a new learner, this exactitude is largely academic. Excepting the Qurʾān, which is inimitable, you may feel free to emulate the writing of good writers of sca.",

    "section": "1.4 Spoken sca",
    "text": "1.4 Spoken sca\nAs we have mentioned above, sca is primarily a written language. As a spoken language, sca is, today, heard almost only in religious and formal settings.\nWe will learn in this book, if Allāh wills, that there are very exact rules for properly pronouncing and pausing in sca. Practically, however, most native Arabic speakers today rarely adhere to these rules exactly in extemporaneous speech. Furthermore, depending on the situation, speakers may sometimes casually mix in their vernacular dialect within their sca speech. In terms of usage, Classical Arabic had many idiomatic expressions that were used in casual, day-to-day speech. But because spoken sca is relegated to formal settings today, many of those expressions are now deemed archaic and are largely unused. In fact, a strict adherence to all sca grammar, usage, and pronunciation/pausing rules in informal spoken settings may, today, come across as pretentious or overly formal.4\nOur advice to the learner who wishes to speak his newly learned Arabic is to learn to be comfortable with the different spheres and sociolinguistic norms of Arabic. Consider the following real-world setting:\nA scholar may be giving a lecture, in Arabic, on one of the Islāmic branches of knowledge. It may even be a lecture on sca grammar. In the beginning of the lecture, the scholar will praise Allāh and ask Allāh to confer blessing upon and grant peace to the Prophet ﷺ This will be done using exact sca grammar and pronunciation/pausing rules.\nThe scholar will then begin the instructional part of his lecture. The language of this instruction will still typically be sca. But adherence to pronunciation and pausing rules may be considerably relaxed. The scholar’s speech may be closer to exact sca rules when giving formal instruction, and then more relaxed when elaborating on some particular point. When quoting an āyah from the Qurʾān, strict sca would be employed, even if not reciting the āyah. The scholar’s fluency in spoken sca is also a factor in how close his extemporaneous formal speech is to sca. Because, like anyone born after the classical era, he is not a native speaker of sca. And his proficiency in speaking exact sca fluently does not detract, if Allāh wills, from his eminence and knowledge of his domain. Within the lecture, the scholar may even dip in and out of his vernacular dialect, often when interacting with a questioner from the audience.\nOnce the lecture is concluded, the scholar and his students may engage in an informal session. The conversation in this session will almost entirely be in vernacular dialect(s).\nIf you find yourself in such a society, it is advisable to conform to its norms. As a non-native Arabic speaker, you won’t be expected to speak a vernacular dialect. So your speaking sca in an informal setting is excused. But aim for a natural and easy flowing speech, even at the cost of grammatical correctness. Don’t over articulate, and vary your pitch and tone.  In fact, it may not be a bad idea to supplement your learning of sca with some knowledge of a vernacular dialect, not least to understand the native speech of the Arabs today.",

However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on the modern language.\nThis book does not touch at all upon the modern vernacular dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.",

Though there is none right now, we also plan to give, if Allāh wills, a vocabulary list and exercises for each chapter.\nWe have generally tried to organize content coherently for convenient reference during learning. Sometimes, this can mean that on encountering a new topic, we present it in more detail than is strictly necessary for learning at that stage. Although identifying such material may not be easy for the learner, you may feel free to skim over such material and refer back to it later, as needed.\nSome of the sentences we present, both as examples and as chapter exercises, because of their contrived nature, may seem of dubious usefulness to a learner wanting to learn practical usage.  Also, when translating examples, we usually steer toward a literal, word-for-word, translation rather than an idiomatic one. This is in order to illustrate the function of each word, and to show a correspondence between the words in the Arabic sentence and the English translation. The resulting English will then often sound awkward and, at times, even ungrammatical. Our excuse is that our aim in this book is to teach Arabic, not how to translate Arabic into English.\nWe request the reader’s patience and indulgence in these and other matters.",

We strongly recommend that you avoid the tendency to answer the exercises only orally or mentally without writing them down, or look up the answers from the answer key before attempting to write the answer yourself, or look up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them, or proceed to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises. You may also find yourself having to go back a few chapters every once in a while and revising the concepts therein. This is very normal and not a cause for any concern. It may also prove beneficial to re-do the exercises of that chapter when doing so.\nKnow that while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a proficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by oneself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts independently. In fact, we would not be too far off to say that grammar, at this stage, is only a tool to help you make sense of the vocabulary that you are acquiring. So strive to achieve a balance between learning grammar and acquiring vocabulary. In appendix @ref(vocabulary-and-reading), we suggest companion reading material, dictionaries, and techniques on acquiring and retaining vocabulary.",

    "section": "1.8 Interpreting the Qurʾān",
    "text": "1.8 Interpreting the Qurʾān\nAs you proceed in your Arabic studies, you may begin to form an understanding of the meanings of some of the āyahs of the Qurʾān. Pondering over the āyahs of the Qurʾān, to understand it, obtain guidance from it, and act upon it is one of the foremost goals of the Qurʾān.5 Know, however, that forming this understanding should be done with a proper methodology: one that is based on sound and confirmed knowledge.6 Interpreting the Qurʾān is one of the branches of Islāmic knowledge known as tafsīr. There are proper sources for tafsīr. They are:\n\nThe Qurʾān. The Qurʾān itself is a source of tafsīr. What is stated in a concise fashion in one place may be elaborated upon at another place.7\nThe Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ. The Sunnah (via the Ḥadīt͡h) is the second most important source of tafsīr. Allāh tasked the Prophet ﷺ with explaining the Qurʾān and gave him ﷺ the necessary knowledge in order for him ﷺ to do so.8\nThe understanding of the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. The Companions had an excellent command of the Arabic language and lived through many of the events that the Qurʾān refers to. Furthermore, if a meaning of an āyah was not clear to them, they had access to the Prophet ﷺ and would ask him ﷺ about its meaning.9\nThe Arabic language.10. One needs to have sound knowledge of the Arabic language of the time of the Prophet ﷺ to be able to interpret the Qurʾān linguistically. However, one cannot rely solely on the Arabic language for tafsīr.11 There are many instances where the Companions, who possessed knowledge of the Arabic language, did not understand the intent of an āyah and it was necessary for the Prophet ﷺ to explain the Qurʾān to them.12\n\nThe specialist in the science of tafsīr is able to use the above sources, and his educated reasoning, to interpret and comment on the meaning of āyahs.13\nThere are grave dangers to speaking about the Qurʾān without sound knowledge. If one interprets and comments on the Qurʾān, then he is actually making a statement on behalf of Allāh.14 So he better be sure that he is making that statement based on sound knowledge. Because speaking about Allāh without knowledge is a most great sin. This is because it involves and includes ascribing something falsely to Allāh.15\nHere is an example of an āyah where it is conceivable that someone may make an incorrect interpretation, if he did not interpret according to a proper methodology:\n\nإِنَّ ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِینَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلنَّصَـٰرَىٰ وَٱلصَّـٰبِـِٔینَ مَنۡ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلۡیَوۡمِ ٱلۡـَٔاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَـٰلِحࣰا فَلَهُمۡ أَجۡرُهُمۡ عِندَ رَبِّهِمۡ وَلَا خَوۡفٌ عَلَیۡهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ یَحۡزَنُونَ [سورة البقرة 2:62]\n\nTranslation by Ṣaḥeeḥ International™:\n\nIndeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)] - those [among them] who believed in Allāh and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\nFootnote by the same translator:\n\nAfter the coming of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) no religion other than Islām is acceptable to Allāh, as stated in 3:85.\n\nThe āyah referred to in the footnote is:\n\nوَمَن یَبۡتَغِ غَیۡرَ ٱلۡإِسۡلَـٰمِ دِینࣰا فَلَن یُقۡبَلَ مِنۡهُ وَهُوَ فِی ٱلۡـَٔاخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلۡخَـٰسِرِینَ [سورة آل عمران 3:85]\nAnd whoever desires other than Islām as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\n\nIbn Kat͡hīr, in his tafsīr of this āyah, cites a report narrated from the the Companion of the Prophet ﷺ Ibn Ɛabbās regarding āyah سورة البقرة 2:62, that Allāh revealed after it سورة آل عمران 3:85.\nIbn Kat͡hīr then says (paraphrasing):\n\nThis statement by Ibn ʿAbbās indicates that Allāh does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muḥammad ﷺ that is, after Allāh sent Muḥammad ﷺ. Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved.16\n\nFrom the tafsīr of this āyah, we see how one āyah is explained using another āyah. And we also see the role of the Companions in tafsīr.\nThe tafsīr of Ibn Kat͡hīr is available, abridged, in English translation:\n\nAl-Mubarakpuri, Tafsir ibn Kathir (abridged, English translation), Darussalam, 2nd edition, 2003\n\nArabic abridged editions also exist:\n\nعمدة التفسير عن الحافظ ابن كثير لأحمد شاكر\nالمصباح المنير فى تهذيب تفسير ابن كثير للمباركفوري\n\nThese are beneficial, if Allāh wills, not only for their tafsīr, but also as good companion reading material for the student of Arabic.",

    "section": "2.2 Writing Arabic words",
    "text": "2.2 Writing Arabic words\n\n2.2.1 Letters in different positions\nArabic is written right-to-left, unlike English and most other languages which are written left-to-right. When writing, the letters in a word are generally joined to each other, except for six out of the 28 letters, which join only to the letter preceding them but not to the letter following them. These six partially-joining letters are ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و.\nWhen joining the letters, letters are modified in order to join to the preceding and following letter. The fully-joining letters can be in four positions:\n\nby itself (isolated),\nin the beginning of a group of joined letters,\nin the middle of a group of joined letters,\nin the end of a group of joined letters.\n\nAs we just mentioned, six of the letters (ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و) don’t join to the following letter. So these letters can only occur only in the end of a group of joined letters, or isolated by themselves.\nIn this book we will show a “Simplified Arabic” writing style where, in each of the four positions, the letter maintains its basic shape and is usually only slightly modified to join to the previous and following letter with horizontal lines.\nTo explain the method of modifying the letters when joining them, we will take ب as an example and start with the isolated form:\nIsolated form: ب\nTo modify this into the end form, we simply join a horizontal line to the right of the letter:\nEnd form: ـب.\nTo get the middle form, we take the end form ـب and cut off its tail which is at its left, and replace it with a horizontal line. We also move the dot slightly to get:\nMiddle form: ـبـ\nAnd finally, to get the beginning form, we take the middle form ـبـ and remove the horizontal line at the right:\nBeginning form: بـ\nNow most of the letters follow this common technique but a few of them are modified a little further in each form. These, more complicated, letters are ع، غ، ك، ه، ي and you can study them and the rest of the letters in the table below:\n\n\n\nNo.\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginning\n\n\n\n\n1\nا\nـا\nnone\nnone\n\n\n2\nب\nـب\nـبـ\nبـ\n\n\n3\nت\nـت\nـتـ\nتـ\n\n\n4\nث\nـث\nـثـ\nثـ\n\n\n5\nج\nـج\nـجـ\nجـ\n\n\n6\nح\nـح\nـحـ\nحـ\n\n\n7\nخ\nـخ\nـخـ\nخـ\n\n\n8\nد\nـد\nnone\nnone\n\n\n9\nذ\nـذ\nnone\nnone\n\n\n10\nر\nـر\nnone\nnone\n\n\n11\nز\nـز\nnone\nnone\n\n\n12\nس\nـس\nـسـ\nسـ\n\n\n13\nش\nـش\nـشـ\nشـ\n\n\n14\nص\nـص\nـصـ\nصـ\n\n\n15\nض\nـض\nـضـ\nضـ\n\n\n16\nط\nـط\nـطـ\nطـ\n\n\n17\nظ\nـظ\nـظـ\nظـ\n\n\n18\nع\nـع\nـعـ\nعـ\n\n\n19\nغ\nـغ\nـغـ\nغـ\n\n\n20\nف\nـف\nـفـ\nفـ\n\n\n21\nق\nـق\nـقـ\nقـ\n\n\n22\nك\nـك\nـكـ\nكـ\n\n\n23\nل\nـل\nـلـ\nلـ\n\n\n24\nم\nـم\nـمـ\nمـ\n\n\n25\nن\nـن\nـنـ\nنـ\n\n\n26\nه\nـه\nـهـ\nهـ\n\n\n27\nو\nـو\nnone\nnone\n\n\n28\nي\nـي\nـيـ\nيـ\n\n\n\nYou can see that each letter maintains a basic shape and is modified for each of the four positions.\n\n\n2.2.2 Joining the different forms to make a word\nNotice that when we modified the isolated form to get to the beginning, middle, and end forms, we added a horizontal line to each or both sides. It is this horizontal line which joines to the horizontal line of the neighboring letter.\nAs an example, we would like to join the following letters (starting from the right): م-ع-ش-ر into one word. The first letter is م so we modify it to its beginning form مـ. The next two letters are converted to their middle forms ـعـ، ـشـ. And the last letter ر is converted to its end form ـر. Then we join the horizontal lines together and get مــعــشــر. Usually, when we join letters like this we shorten the horizontal lines so you will generally see the word like this معشر.\nIn this example, we needed the beginning, middle, and end forms of the letters. Isolated forms are used in a word when there is a partially-joining letter present that won’t join to the following letter. The letter after a partially-joining letter will be in its beginning form even though it is in the middle of a word. But if it too is a partially-joining letter, or it is the last letter in the word then it will take its isolated form.\nLet’s take a look at some examples where a group of disjoint letters are joined to form a word:\n\n\n\nDisjoint\nJoined\n\n\n\n\nذ-ل-ك\nذلك\n\n\nا-ح-م-د\nاحمد\n\n\nر-س-و-ل\nرسول\n\n\nو-ز-ي-ر\nوزير\n\n\nر-ا-ز-ق\nرازق\n\n\n\nNotice that in the last example, all the letters were in the isolated form.\n\n2.2.2.1 Simplified and Traditional writing styles\nWe have just shown how letters join to each other with a horizontal line in the Simplified Arabic writing style. Traditional Arabic writing styles are a little more complex than Simplified Arabic: some letters join almost vertically instead of horizontally. But when you get familiar with the Simplified Arabic writing style, if Allah wills, it will not be too difficult for you to read the Traditional Arabic writing style as well.\nHere are some comparisions of letters joining to each other in the Simplified Arabic and Traditional Arabic writing styles.\n\n\n\nDisjoint\nJoined (simplified)\nJoined (traditional)\n\n\n\n\nت-م-ر\nتمر\nتمر\n\n\nا-ل-ح-ج-ج\nالحجج\nالحجج\n\n\nا-ل-م-ا-س\nالماس\nالماس\n\n\nل-م-ح-ة\nلمحة\nلمحة\n\n\nس-ح-ر\nسحر\nسحر\n\n\nب-ح-ي-ر-ة\nبحيرة\nبحيرة\n\n\nف-ي\nفي\nفي\n\n\nب-ت-ث-ب-ي-ت-ت-ي-ن\nبتثبيتتين\nبتثبيتتين\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 ة (closed tāʾ)\nة is a special letter which is merged from two letters of the alphabet. It is a ت but it is written as a ه with two dots above it. ة is pronounced exactly as a ت, except when it is at the end of a sentence in which case it is pronounced as a ه as we’ll explain later, if Allāh wills. ة occurs only at the end of a word so it has only an end form and an isolated form (used when the letter before it is a partially-joining letter).\nExamples:\n\nفاطمة\nشجرة\nفتاة\n\nWe call ة closed tāʾ because it appears as if have taken ت and pressed it until it closed on itself. In contrast, ت is called open tāʾ when needed to differentiate it from ة.\n\n\n2.2.4 Writing hamzah\nWe have mentioned that hamzah was a later addition to the Arabic alphabet and originally it was only sounded and not written. Hamzah can be written in a number of different ways:\n\n“Seated” above (or below) a vowel letter: Hamzah can be written above the vowel letters thus: أ ؤ ئ. When written over ي, the ي will not have any dots, thus: ئـ، ـئـ، ـئ. It may also be written under an alif thus: إ. Examples: أفعال, سؤلك, فئة, إن.\n“Unseated” after a letter. This has two sub cases:\n\nStandalone, after a partially-joining letter or at the end of a word. Examples: تساءل, توءم, عبء.\nInline, in the middle of a word after a fully-joining letter. In this case hamzah is written above the horizontal line that joins the letters. Examples: خطيـٔة, شيـٔا, بريـٔين.\n\n\nIn all cases it is pronounced the same. There are actually a set of fairly complicated rules that determine which of the above ways to choose when writing hamzah. We present these rules in Appendix @ref(hamzarules). We recommend that for now, you memorize the spelling of each word that we present that contains a hamzah. When you are sufficiently advanced, and curious enough, you may refer to Appendix @ref(hamzarules) to learn the full set of rules.\n\n\n2.2.5 Disambiguating letters that look similar\nSome letters are very similar to each other and only differ in their dots or other slight differences. You should take care to distinguish between these letters. We will describe their similarities and differences here.\nThe letters ب, ت, and ث differ only in their dots and are otherwise identical in all positions. ن and ي are similar in initial and middle positions to ب, ت, and ث but differ from them and from each other in isolated and final positions. Compare all five in the table below:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nب\nـب\nـبـ\nبـ\n\n\nت\nـت\nـتـ\nتـ\n\n\nث\nـث\nـثـ\nثـ\n\n\nن\nـن\nـنـ\nنـ\n\n\nي\nـي\nـيـ\nيـ\n\n\n\nThese groups of letters differ too, only in their dots:\n\nج, ح, and خ\nد and ذ\nر and ز\nس and ش\nص and ض\nط and ظ\nع and غ\n\nThe letters ف and ق are similar in the initial and middle positions except for the dots. But in the isolated and final positions, the tail of ق goes lower than that of ف.\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nف\nـف\nـفـ\nفـ\n\n\nق\nـق\nـقـ\nقـ\n\n\n\nBe careful also not to confuse غ and ف in their middle forms. The loop for ف is round where it is triangular and flat-topped for غ (as it is for ع). Compare their middle forms in the table below:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nMiddle\n\n\n\n\nغ\nـغـ\n\n\nف\nـفـ\n\n\n\nThe letters alif ا and lām ل could also be confused for each other. Their forms are shown here again for easy comparison:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nا\nـا\nnone\nnone\n\n\nل\nـل\nـلـ\nلـ\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Joining alif after lām\nWhen the letter alif follows lām we would expect them to be joined like this ل+ا → لـا. But actually, they are joined in a special way\nل+ا → لا\nWhen the combination occurs at the end of a group of joined letters, it will appear thus:\nـلا\nExamples:\n\nألا\nالإيمان\nالصلاة",

    "section": "2.3 Vowels and pronunciation marks.",
    "text": "2.3 Vowels and pronunciation marks.\n\n2.3.1 Short Vowels\nArabic has six vowels. There are three short vowels which don’t have letters in the alphabet. Instead they are shown with pronunciation marks:\n\na as the first vowel in English “manipulate”, written with an fat·ḥah ◌َ which is a small diagonal line above the letter like مَـ ma.\ni as in English “bit”, written with an kasrah ◌ِ which is a small diagonal line under the letter like بِـ bi.\nu as in English “put”, written with an ḍammah ◌ُ which is like a tiny و wāw above the letter like فُـ fu.\n\nExamples of words with short vowels:\n\nفَتَحَ fataḥa\nعَمِلَ ɛamila\nقُتِلَ qutila\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Long Vowels\nThere are also three long vowels which are part of the alphabet:\n\nā generally written with an unmarked alif ا and with the preceding letter having an fat·ḥah. Example مَا mā. This vowel is mostly pronounced like the vowel in English “man”. If however, it comes after these letters خ،ر،ص،ض،ط،ظ،غ،ق it is pronounced like English “awe”.\nī like in English “meek” written with an unmarked ي yāʾ with the preceding letter having an kasrah. Example فِي fī.\nū like in English “moon” written with an unmarked و wāw with the preceding letter having an ḍammah. Example ذُو d͡hū.\n\nExamples of words with long and short vowels:\n\nهَارُونُ hārūnu\nكَذَا kad͡hā\nسَرَادِيبَ sarādība\n\n\n2.3.2.1 ā vowel written with a small alif\nSometimes the ā vowel is written as a small alif ◌ٰ, called a “dagger alif”, instead of a regular alif ا. This is done only for a few commonly used words. Here are some examples:\n\nهَـٰذَا hād͡hā\nذَ ٰلِكَ d͡hālika\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 ā vowel written with a yāʾ\nIn some other words, the ā vowel is written with a yāʾ instead of an alif ا. When this happens, we will write the yāʾ without its dots and write a dagger alif ◌ٰ above it, like this ىٰ. Here are some examples:\n\nعَلَىٰ ɛalā\nرَمَىٰ ramā\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Zero-vowel written with a sukūn\nAs we have seen above if an Arabic letter has a vowel after it it will take one of the three pronunciation marks: ◌َ, ◌ِ, ◌ُ. If, however, there is no vowel after the letter we will put a zero-vowel sukūn on it ◌ْ. This mark can generally only occur if there is a short vowel before the letter. Examples:\n\nكَمْ kam\nمُنْذُ mund͡hu\nمِنْهُمْ minhum\nمِنْهَا minhā\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Semi-vowels\nArabic has two short semi-vowels:\n\naw like in English “show”. This is written with a wāw with a sukūn on it and a short a vowel before it. Example لَوْ law.\nay like in English “bait”. This is written with a yāʾ with a sukūn on it and a short a vowel before it. Example كَيْ kay. Examples with short semi-vowels:\n\n\nوَيْحَكَ wayḥaka\nغَيْرُهُ g͡hayruhu\nقَوْلُهُ qawluhu\n\nIt also has two long semi-vowels:\n\nāw like in English “cow”. This is written with a wāw with a sukūn on it and a long ā vowel before it. Example وَاوْ wāw.\nāy like in English “bye”. This is written with a yāʾ with a sukūn on it and a long ā vowel before it. Example شَايْ s͡hāy.\n\nThese long semi-vowels are rare and may only occur at the end of a sentence.\n\n\n2.3.5 Doubled letters\nA word may contain “doubled” letters. This is when the same letter occurs, one after the other; the first letter has a sukūn, and the second letter has a vowel. For example, in the word قَتْتَلَ qattala, the letter ت is doubled. When this occurs, we actually only write the letter once and put a “s͡haddah” ◌ّ on it, like so: قَتَّلَ qattala. When pronouncing this word, stop at and stress the doubled letter qattala and make sure it does not sound like the undoubled letter in قَتَلَ qatala. Examples with doubled letters:\n\nكَبَّرَ kabbara\nحَدُّهُ ḥadduhu\nفَعَّالَ faɛɛāla\nسِكِّينُ sikkīnu. Note that the kasrah is below the s͡haddah but above the letter ك. This is the most common way to write this, although having the kasrah below the letter is also sometimes done as well. (In this case, the s͡haddah will still be above the letter.)\nسَفُّودُ saffūdu\nضَالِّينَ ḍāllīna\nمُزَّمِّلُ muzzammilu\n\n\n\n2.3.6 tanwīn\nIn the next chapter, we will learn, if Allāh wills, that nouns in Arabic are sometimes pronouned with an extra ن sound at their end. This is called tanwīn. tanwīn is indicated in writing, not by adding a the letter ن at the end of the word, but by writing the final vowel mark twice, thus:\n\n◌ٌ un, for example كِتَابٌ kitābun.\n◌ً an, for example شَجَرَةً s͡hajaratan.\n◌ٍ in, for example بَيْتٍ baytin.\n\n\nThe tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً has specific spelling rules: Generally, we will generally add a silent alif after it, for example سَالِم becomes سَالِمًا sāliman. This is done for all words except:\n\nIf the word ends with a ة. In this case we don’t add the silent alif. For example, غَاضِبَة becomes غَاضِبَةً g͡hāḍibatan. \nIf the word ends with a ā vowel, whether written with an alif ا or as a yāʾ with dagger alif ىٰ. In this case, the an mark is put on the letter before the alif ا or yāʾ ىٰ and the final vowel letter becomes silent and is not pronounced. For example, مُصْطَفَىٰ becomes مُصْطَفًى muṣṭafan, عَصَا becomes عَصًا ɛaṣan.\nIf the word ends with a hamzah. In this case, we might or might not write a silent alif, depending on the following rules:\n\nIf there is an alif before an unseated hamzah اء, then we don’t add a silent alif. For example دَاء becomes دَاءً dāʾan, not دَاءًا.\nOtherwise, we add a silent alif after the hamzah. However, this may affect the writing of the hamzah, for example مُبْتَدَأ becomes مُبْتَدَءًا mubtadaʾan. This is discussed further in appendix @ref(hamzarules).\n\n\nHere are some examples of tanwīned words:\n\nسَعْدٌ saɛdun \nضَرْبًا ḍarban \nقَاضٍ qāḍin \nسَعَةً saɛatan \nدُعَاءً duɛāʾan \nٱِمْرَءًا imraʾan \nشَيْـًٔا s͡hayʾan \nسُوءًا sūʾan \nغَبَنٌ g͡habanun",

    "section": "2.4 Connecting hamzah",
    "text": "2.4 Connecting hamzah\nSome words in arabic begin with a sukūn. When this occurs a connecting hamzah ٱ (written as a tiny صـ on an alif) is put before it. If this word comes in the beginning of the sentence the connecting alif is pronounced as a hamzah. Otherwise this connecting hamzah is not pronounced and the word is connected to the final vowel of the previous word in pronunciation. In this tutorial we will transcribe the connecting hamzah with a hyphen “-”. Examples of connecting hamzah:\nٱِفْتَحِ ٱلْبَابَ\nʾiftaḥi -lbāba\nٱُنْظُرْ\nʾunḍ͡hur\nIf the previous word does not end with a vowel, then a helper vowel is added. The most common helper vowel is ◌ِ. Example:\nزَيْدٌ ٱلْكَرِيمُ\nzayduni -lkarīmu\nWhen one word ends in a long vowel and the next word begins with a connecting hamzah, the long vowel becomes a short vowel in pronunciation, but in writing the long vowel’s letter is retained. For example:\nأَخَذَ مِنَّا ٱلْكِتَابَ\nʾak͡had͡ha minna -lkitāba\nذُو ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ\nd͡hu -lqarnayni\nفِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nfi -lbayti",

    "section": "2.5 Pronouncing the end of a sentence",
    "text": "2.5 Pronouncing the end of a sentence\nWhen a word is at the end of a sentence and it ends with a long vowel, then the final long vowel is pronounced normally. However, when a word at the end of a sentence does not end with a long vowel, then the final letter’s pronunciation mark is pronounced as a sukūn when vocalizing the sentence. If the final letter is a ة then it is pronounced as a ه hāʾ with a sukūn.\nThis change in pronunciation is only vocal, it does not affect how we write the pronunciation mark. Here we give some examples of words pronounced if they were at the end of a sentence:\nفَتْحُ\nfat·ḥ\nعُقْبَةٌ\nɛuqbah\nوَالِدَايَ\nwālidāy\nوَالِدَيَّ\nwālidayy\nIf however, the final letter’s pronunciation mark is a an mark then it is pronounced as a long-ā vowel. The only exception is if the final letter were ةً, in which case it is then pronounced as a hāʾ with a sukūn هْ. Here are examples of words with an marks pronounced as if they were at the end of a sentence.\nمَفْعُولًا\nmafɛūlā\nسَاجِدًا\nsājidā\nمَرْفُوعَةً\nmarfūɛah\nNote that the above exception is only for ة. If a hamzah with an an mark occurs at the end of a word, then it too will be pronounced as if it had a long-ā vowel after it. Such is the case, whether or not a silent alif is written after the hamzah. Examples:\n\nمُبْتَدَءًا is pronounced mubtadaʾā\nدُعَاءً is pronounced duɛāʾā\n\nSimilarly, if the word has a final yāʾ that represents the long-ā vowel, and the letter before has an an mark, it is pronounced with the long-ā vowel at the end of the sentence. For example:\n\nمُصْطَفًى is pronounced muṣṭafā\n\nExcept in this section, we will usually transcribe Arabic into English letters without modifiying the transcription for the last word in the sentence. This is because the last vowel mark is helpful for us to learn the grammatical function of the word. But when saying the sentence out aloud you should pronounce the ending of the final word as we have just described.\nFor example, the sentence:\nذَهَبَ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ\nwill be transcribed, in the remainder of this book, as:\nd͡hahaba ʾila -lbayti\nbut should be pronounced as\nd͡hahaba ʾila -lbayt",

    "text": "2.6 The Qurʾānic script\nThe Arabic script that you will find in the muṣḥaf (a volume of the Qurʾān) is slightly different than what is used in (non-Qurʾānic) sca.\n\nThe principal difference that concerns us is that آ is used in sca as a replacement for ءَا. Whereas, in the Qurʾānic script آ denotes an elongated long ā vowel without a hamzah. The following table gives some examples:\n\n\n\nsca script\nQurʾānic script\n\n\n\n\nالْآخِرَةُ alʾāk͡hiratu\nٱلۡـَٔاخِرَةُ [سورة البقرة 2:94]\n\n\nالضَّالِّينَ aḍḍāllīna\nٱلضَّاۤلِّینَ [سورة الفاتحة 1:7]\n\n\n\nAnother minor difference is that word-final ي is written without its dots in Qurʾānic script. (By the, this is also found as a regional variance in the sca script.) For example:\n\n\n\nsca script\nQurʾānic script\n\n\n\n\nإِنِّي ʾinnī\nإِنِّی [سورة طه 20:94]\n\n\n\nThere can also be regional differences in the pronunciation marks used in the Qurʾānic script. For example, in muṣḥafs that are used in the Indian subcontinent الۡاٰخِرَةُ is the conventional spelling.\nThere are other minor differences as well, mainly dealing with pronunciation and punctuation.\nBesides the above differences that have to do with the diacritical marks, some words, and combinations of words, may also be spelled differently. For example:\n\n\n\nsca script\nQurʾānic script\n\n\n\n\nٱلصَّلَاةَ aṣṣalāta\nٱلصَّلَوٰةَ [سورة البقرة 2:3]\n\n\nٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ assamāwāti\nٱلسَّمَـٰوَ ٰ⁠تِ [سورة البقرة 2:33]\n\n\nيَا ٱبْنَ أُمَّ ya -bna ʾumma\nیَبۡنَؤُمَّ [سورة طه 20:94]\n\n\n\nThe reasons for this are out of the scope of this book.",

    "section": "3.2 Definiteness",
    "text": "3.2 Definiteness\nWhen talking about nouns it is necessary to introduce a topic called definiteness.\nA noun is definite when the person or thing it refers to is known. For example, if you say, “The man arrived.” then the usage of the word “the” before “man” tells us that the man is known to us. Therefore the noun “man” is definite in this sentence.\nConversely, if we had said “A man arrived.” then the use of “a” before “man” tells us that the man is unknown to us. Therefore “man” is indefinite in this sentence.\n“The” is called the definite article and “a” is called the indefinite article.\n\n3.2.1 Definite nouns in Arabic\nThe definite article in Arabic is ٱَلْ ʾal. It corresponds to the English definite article “the”. In order to make a noun definite, we attach ٱَلْ ʾal to its beginning.\nFor example, the definite noun “the book” in Arabic is ٱَلْكِتَاب ʾalkitāb.\nٱَلْ ʾal begins with a connecting hamzah; the hamzah will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence. And when it occurs in the beginning of a sentence, the hamzah is pronounced with a ◌َ a-mark.\n\n3.2.1.1 Sun letters and moon letters\nThe noun “man” in Arabic is رَجُل rajul. To make this noun definite, we add ٱَلْ ʾal to the beginning of the word. But instead of becoming ٱَلْرَجُل ʾalrajul the word becomes ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrajul. The ل in ٱَلْ becomes silent and the ر gets doubled. This happens because the first letter ر in the word رَجُل rajul is from a group of letters called “sun letters”. For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when ٱَلْ ʾal is put in the beginning, the ل in ٱَلْ becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.\nThe rest of the letters in the alphabet are called “moon letters” and for words that begin with moon letters, the ل in ٱَلْ does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, ك is a moon letter and we have already seen that كِتَاب kitāb “book” becomes ٱَلْكِتَاب ʾalkitāb “the book”.\nThe sun letters are ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن.\nThe moon letters are ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي.\nThe names “sun letters” and “moon letters” were given because of the Arabic words for “sun” and “moon” respectively. “The sun” in Arabic is ٱَلشَّمْس ʾas͡hs͡hams which begins with ش which causes the ل in ٱَلْ to be silent. “The moon” is ٱَلْقَمَر ʾalqamar which begins with ق which does not cause the ل in ٱَلْ to be silent. Thus ش represents the sun letters and ق represents the moon letters.\nHere are some examples of words that begin with sun letters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoun\nDefinite noun\n\n\n\n\nرَجُل rajul “man”\nٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrajul “the man”\n\n\nتَاجِر tājir “trader”\nٱَلتَّاجِر ʾattājir “the trader”\n\n\nلُعْبَة luɛbah “toy”\nٱَللُّعْبَة ʾalluɛbah “the toy”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 The definite article ٱَلْ ʾal with nouns with an initial connecting hamzah\nIf the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal is with prefixed to nouns that have an initial connecting hamzah, then the ل shall no longer have an sukūn ◌ْ. Instead it shall have an kasrah ◌ِ. Example:\nٱَلِٱبْن\nʾali-bn\n“the son”\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Indefinite nouns in Arabic\nArabic has no indefinite article corresponding to the English indefinite article “a”. In order to make a noun indefinite in Arabic, it is simply written or pronounced without the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal. For example, كِتَاب kitāb “a book”.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Differences in definiteness between Arabic and English\nThe articles “a” and “the” are types of words called determiners. Besides “a” and “the”, English has other determiners like “some”, “this”, “that”, etc. that can make a noun definite or indefinite. For example:\n“This man gave that boy some food.”\nIn the above sentence “man” and “boy” are definite, and “food” is indefinite.\nEnglish can also have definite or indefinite nouns without determiners. The definiteness of the noun is then determined by the meaning of the sentence. Consider, for example, the sentence:\n“Time is valuable.”\nHere, we are not talking about some indefinite amount of time, but rather the general concept of time, which is known to us. Therefore, the noun “time” here is definite.\nConsider now the sentence:\n“We don’t have to leave just yet; we have time.”\nHere, “time” has an indefinite meaning “[some] time”. \nAs opposed to this complicated situation in English, Arabic uses only the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal to make common nouns definite. So when translating sentences from English to Arabic, you must first determine whether the noun is definite or not in English, and then use ٱَلْ ʾal when the noun is definite.\nExamples:\n\n“This man gave that boy some food.”\n\nman: definite; Arabic: ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrujul\nboy: definite; Arabic: ٱَلْغُلَام ʾalg͡hulām\nfood: indefinite; Arabic: طَعَام ṭaɛām\n\n“Time is valuable.”\n\ntime: definite; Arabic: ٱَلْوَقْت ʾalwaqt\n\n“We don’t have to leave just yet; we have time.”\n\ntime: indefinite; Arabic: وَقْت waqt",

    "text": "3.3 State\nNouns in Arabic have a property called state. The state of a noun is dependent on the function of the noun in a sentence. The state of a noun is indicated by the noun’s ending. There are three states that a noun can be in. They are: \n\nthe u-state. This is considered the ‘highest’ state. It is indicated, for most nouns, by a ḍammah on the final letter of the noun.\nthe a-state. This is ‘lower’ than the u-state. It is indicated, for most nouns, by a fat·ḥah on the final letter of the noun.\nthe i-state. This is the ‘lowest’ state. It is indicated, for most nouns, by a kasrah on the final letter of the noun.\n\nWhen a noun is indefinite, then, for most nouns, it is also tanwīned. Here, for example, is the noun كِتَاب kitāb “book” in its three states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite “a book”\nDefinite “the book”\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nكِتَابٌ kitābun\nٱَلْكِتَابُ ʾalkitābu\n\n\na-state\nكِتَابًا kitāban\nٱَلْكِتَابَ ʾalkitāba\n\n\ni-state\nكِتَابٍ kitābin\nٱَلْكِتَابِ ʾalkitābi\n\n\n\nThe u-state is a noun’s normal state, and there needs to be a reason to take the noun out of this state into another state.

    "section": "3.4 Grammatical gender",
    "text": "3.4 Grammatical gender\nSome nouns designate animate beings like “man”, “woman”, “boy”, “girl”, “dog”, “cow”, etc. Other nouns designate inanimate objects like “book”, “house”, “hand”, “tree”, “city”, “food”.\nIn dealing with the grammatical genders of such nouns, English uses three genders:\n\nThe masculine gender. This is used for nouns that designate male human beings and also some male animals. The pronouns used for the masculine gender are “he”, “him”, and “his”.\nThe feminine gender. This is used for nouns that designate female human beings, and also some female animals. The pronouns used for the feminine gender are “she” and “her”.\nThe neutral gender. This is used for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals in general. The pronoun used for the neutral gender is “it”.\n\nIn Arabic, there are only two grammatical genders: the masculine gender and the feminine gender. All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. Nouns that designate male human beings are assigned the masculine grammatical gender. And nouns that designate female human beings are assigned the feminine grammatical gender. Nouns that designate animals sometimes conform to the gender of the animal. Other times, they have a fixed gender. As for nouns that designate inanimate objects, these, too, are assigned a gender. For example, كِتَاب kitāb “book” in Arabic is masculine. And شَجَرَة s͡hajarah “tree” in Arabic is feminine. We shall discuss this in more detail below.\n\n3.4.1 Nouns that designate animate beings.\nIn Arabic, in terms of their form, nouns that designate animate beings are in three categories:\n\nThere are separate but matching nouns for the male and female animate beings.\nThere are separate and unrelated nouns for the male and female animate beings.\nThe same noun is used for both sexes.\n\nWe will discuss each of these categories below.\n\n3.4.1.1 Matching nouns for male and female animate beings\nIn Arabic for some nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for both sexes match each other. Here are some examples: \n\nPrimitive nouns\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\nmasc.\nson\n\n\nٱِبْنَة ʾibnah\nfem.\ndaughter\n\n\nطِفْل ṭifl\nmasc.\nchild\n\n\nطِفْلَة ṭiflah\nfem.\n(female) child\n\n\nإِنْسَان ʾinsān\nmasc.\nhuman being\n\n\nإِنْسَانَة ʾinsānah\nfem.\n(female) human being\n\n\nحُرّ ḥurr\nmasc.\nfree man\n\n\nحُرَّة ḥurrah\nfem.\nfree woman\n\n\nكَلْب kalb\nmasc.\n(male) dog\n\n\nكَلْبَة kalbah\nfem.\n(female) dog\n\n\nهِرّ hirr\nmasc.\n(male) cat\n\n\nهِرَّة hirrah\nfem.\n(female) cat\n\n\n\n\n\nDerived nouns\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nمُعَلِّم muɛallim\nmasc.\n(male) teacher\n\n\nمُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah\nfem.\n(female) teacher\n\n\nطَالِب ṭālib\nmasc.\n(male) student\n\n\nطَالِبَة ṭālibah\nfem.\n(female) student\n\n\nصَاحِب ṣāḥib\nmasc.\n(male) companion\n\n\nصَاحِبَة ṣāḥibah\nfem.\n(female) companion\n\n\nصَدِيق ṣadīq\nmasc.\n(male) friend\n\n\nصَدِيقَة ṣadīqah\nfem.\n(female) friend\n\n\n\nIn each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is basically the same as the masculine noun but with the addition of a ة at the end. For example, طِفْل ṭifl is masculine, and its feminine is طِفْلَة ṭiflah (fem.).\nAs a matter of fact, the ة is called a feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other, less common, feminine markers besides ة that we will learn them later, if Allāh wills.\nNote that the vowel-mark before the ة is always an fat·ḥah. \nNote also that we have divided the nouns above into two categories:\n\nPrimitive nouns\nDerived nouns\n\nPrimitve nouns have a primitive meaning, without a primarily adjectival or verbal quality in the meaning, for example “human” “cat”, etc. For derived nouns, their meaning is derived from an adjectival or verbal quality. For example, a “teacher” is someone who teaches. A “friend” is someone who is friendly. And so on.\n\nFor derived nouns, the formation of the feminine noun by adding a feminine marker (like ة) to the masculine noun is normal and expected. Whereas, for primitive nouns, the fact that the feminine and masuline nouns match each other and differ only by the feminine marker ة is something that, although somewhat common, is more of a coincidence.\nAnother noteworthy point is that, for many primitive nouns, sometimes only one of the masculine/feminine pair may be used to refer to beings of either sex. What we mean by this is that, for example, كَلْب kalb, while remaining a masculine noun, can be used to refer to both a male dog and a female dog, especially if the animal’s physical gender is not obvious or particularly important. And كَلْبَة kalbah (fem.) “a female dog” is typically only used when it is needed to specify the gender of the animal. Conversely, هِرَّة hirrah “a (female) cat” may be used to refer to cat of either physical gender, especially if it is not obvious whether it is a male or female cat.\nThis preference of the noun of one gender to refer to beings of either physical gender is case-by-case. For example, طِفْل ṭifl (masc.) is commonly used to say “a child”, regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl. But طِفْلَة ṭiflah, although not uncommon, is used specifically for “a female child”.\nAs another example, the word إِنْسَانَة ʾinsānah (fem.) “a female human being” is rarely used at all. Instead, the word إِنْسَان ʾinsān, while remaining a masculine noun, is almost always used to refer to “a human being” in general, regardless of actual gender.\nOn the other hand,  ٱِبْن ʾibn “son” and ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah “daughter” are only ever used for their respective gender. So ٱِبْن ʾibn (masc.) “a son” is never used to mean “a daughter”. And ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah (fem.) “a daughter” is never used to mean “a son”. \n\nAs for derived nouns, they are typically only ever used for their respective gender. So, for example, مُعَلِّم muɛallim (masc.) is only used for “a (male) teacher”. And مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) is only used for “a (female) teacher”.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Unrelated nouns for male and female animate beings\nFor other nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for the male and female sexes are completely unrelated. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nأَب ʾab\nmasc.\nfather\n\n\nأُمّ ʾumm\nfem.\nmother\n\n\nغُلَام g͡hulām\nmasc.\nboy\n\n\nجَارِيَة jāriyah\nfem.\ngirl\n\n\nعَبْد ɛabd\nmasc.\nmale slave\n\n\nأَمَة ʾamah\nfem.\nfemale slave\n\n\nأَسَد ʾasad\nmasc.\nlion\n\n\nلَبْوَة labwah\nfem.\nlioness\n\n\nثَوْر t͡hawr\nmasc.\nbull\n\n\nبَقَرَة baqarah\nfem.\ncow\n\n\n\nEven in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a ة feminine marker. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker like ة. أُمّ ʾumm “mother” is one of these exceptions.\n\n\n3.4.1.3 Using the same noun for both sexes\nThere are other nouns for animate beings where the same word is used for both sexes. The word itself will still be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nشَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ\nmasc.\nperson\n\n\nنَفْس nafs\nfem.\nself\n\n\nعَدُوّ ɛaduww\nmasc.\nenemy\n\n\nحَيَوَان ḥayawān\nmasc.\nanimal\n\n\nطَائِر ṭāʾir\nmasc.\nbird\n\n\nقِرْد qird\nmasc.\nmonkey\n\n\nحَمَامَة ḥamāmah\nfem.\ndove\n\n\nنَمْلَة namlah\nfem.\nant\n\n\n\nSo, for example, قِرْد qird “monkey” is grammatically masculine but it will be used for both a male and a female monkey. Similarly, شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ is a masculine noun meaning “person”. While remaining grammatically masculine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female persons. While, نَفْس nafs is a feminine noun meaning “self”. While remaining grammatically feminine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female selves\nNote also that نَفْس nafs “self” is a feminine noun but it does not end in a ة. It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that don’t have a female marker, like أُمّ ʾumm (fem.) “mother”.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Nouns that designate inanimate objects\nAs mentioned earlier, nouns that designate inanimate objects are assigned a fixed grammatical gender. There is usually no discernable reason why some are assigned a masculine gender while others are assigned a feminine gender.\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nكِتَاب kitāb\nmasc.\nbook\n\n\nبَيْت bayt\nmasc.\nhouse\n\n\nقَلَم qalam\nmasc.\npen\n\n\nطَعَام ṭaɛām\nmasc.\nfood\n\n\nمَاء māʾ\nmasc.\nwater\n\n\nمَدْرَسَة madrasah\nfem.\nschool\n\n\nمَدِينَة madīnah\nfem.\ncity\n\n\nغُرْفَة g͡hurfah\nfem.\nroom\n\n\nشَجَرَة s͡hajarah\nfem.\ntree\n\n\nشَمْس s͡hams\nfem.\nsun\n\n\nقَمَر qamar\nmasc.\nmoon\n\n\nعِلْم ɛilm\nmasc.\nknowledge\n\n\nقُوَّة quwwah\nfem.\nstrength\n\n\nحَيَاة ḥayāh\nfem.\nlife\n\n\nمَوْت mawt\nmasc.\ndeath\n\n\n\nIn these nouns as well, we note that feminine nouns usually end with the feminine marker ة. But here too, we find another exception: شَمْس s͡hams “sun” which is feminine but does not end with a feminine marker. These exceptions are not very many and, if Allāh wills, we will not find it hard to memorize them.\nThere is a sub-group of nouns that designate inanimate objects, but can also be used to refer to animate beings. Here are a couple of examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nرَهِينَة rahīnah\nfem.\npledge\n\n\nعُضْو ɛuḍw\nmasc.\nmember\n\n\n\nرَهِينَة rahīnah is a feminine noun meaning “pledge”. For inanimate objects it refers to something that is held as a security or a collateral. With its animate meaning, it is used to refer to a human hostage.\nSimilarly, عُضْو ɛuḍw is a masculine noun meaning “member”. For inanimate objects it refers to a limb which is the member of a body. With its animate meaning it refers to a person who is a member of a professional organization.\nJust like we saw for the nouns in section @using-the-same-noun-for-both-sexes, such nouns adhere to their fixed grammatical gender when used for either male or female persons.1\n\n\n3.4.3 Nouns with mismarked gender\nWe saw that there are some nouns that are feminine, but do not end with with a feminine marker like ة. These were:\n\nأُمّ ʾumm (fem.) “mother”\nنَفْس nafs (fem.) “self”\nشَمْس s͡hams (fem.) “sun”\n\nThere are a few more nouns that are like this. One special category among them is body parts. Many prominent body parts that come in pairs or more, are grammatically feminine, whether or not they end with a feminine marker like ة. Here are some examples:\n\n\nيَد yad (fem.) “hand” (sometimes “an arm”)\nعَيْن ɛayn (fem.) “eye”\nأُذُن ʾud͡hun (fem.) “ear”\nقَدَم qadam (fem.) “foot”\nرِجْل rijl (fem.) “leg” (sometimes “foot”)\nإِبْهَام ʾibhām (fem.) “thumb”\nإِصْبَع ʾiṣbaɛ (fem.) “finger, toe”\nسِنّ sinn (fem.) “tooth”\nرُكْبَة rukbah (fem.) “knee”\n\nThere are exceptions, however. The following body parts come in pairs yet are masculine.\n\nمَنْخَر mank͡har (masc.) “nostril”\nمِرْفَق mirfaq (masc.) “elbow”\n\nThere are other such exceptions as well.\n\nBody parts that don’t come in pairs are typically more regular in their gender: they are feminine if they end in a feminine marker like ة, and masculine if they don’t. Examples:\n\nرَأْس raʾs (masc.) “head”\nأَنْف ʾanf (masc.) “nose”\nبَطْن baṭn (masc.) “belly”\nلِحْيَة liḥyah (fem.) “beard”\n\nConversely, nouns that end with a feminine marker like ة, yet are masculine are very rare. Some of the more common of them are:\n\nخَلِيفَة k͡halīfah (masc.) “caliph”\nعَلَّامَة ɛallāmah (masc.) “great scholar”\nدَاعِيَة dāɛiyah (masc.) “great preacher”\n\nThere are also a few words which can be optionally assigned a masculine or feminine gender. Among these are:\n\nسُوق sūq (masc. or fem.) “market”\nطَرِيق ṭarīq (masc. or fem.) “path”\n\nA good dictionary should mention the gender of all these exceptional words. In addition, in appendix @ref(unmarked-fem-nouns) as well, we have a compiled a list of feminine nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker. (TODO: get from Hava: pg. xi (fem) and xii (admitting either gender).)",

    "text": "4.2 Forming nounal sentences\nHere is a nounal sentence:\n\n\nThe subject of the sentence is “the building”. This means that the sentence is about “the building”.\nThe info is “a house”. This means that the info that the sentence is giving us about the subject is that it is “a house”.\nLet’s try to form this sentence in Arabic.\nFirst we assemble the individual parts:\n\n“The building” in Arabic is ٱَلْبِنَاء ʾalbināʾ (masc.).\n“A house” is بَيْت bayt (masc.).\n\nNext we put them both in the u-state. For nounal sentences, both the subject and the info shall be in the u-state. Remember that the u-state is formed by putting a tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ at the end of an indefinite noun, and a ḍammah ◌ُ at the end of a definite noun. Here are the two nouns in the u-state:\n\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ ʾalbināʾu (masc.) “the building” (u-state)\nبَيْتٌ baytun (masc.) “a house” (u-state)\n\nIn order to form this sentence in Arabic, we put the subject first and then the info. So we get:\n\n\nBut wait! Where is the Arabic word for “is”? It turns out that Arabic does not usually express any word for “is”. Instead, the meaning of this word is implied.\nAlso, note that the final vowel mark at the end of the sentence is written but not pronounced. So we will write بَيْتٌ but say bayt, not baytun. This is in accordance with what we learned in section @ref(pronouncing-the-end-of-a-sentence).\nNow let’s try reversing this sentence, and try making the sentence:\n“The house is a building.”\nWe follow the same procedure by assembling the individual parts of the sentence and putting them in the u-state:\n\nThe subject: ٱَلْبَيْتُ ʾalbaytu (masc.) “the house” (u-state)\nThe info: بِنَاءٌ bināʾun (masc.) “a building” (u-state)\n\nAnd then we put them together, first the subject and then the info:\nٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalbaytu bināʾ.\n“The house is a building.”\nand there we have our sentence.",

    "section": "4.3 Matching the gender between the subject and the info",
    "text": "4.3 Matching the gender between the subject and the info\nIn the sentences above, both the subject and the info were masculine nouns. Now let’s try forming a sentence where the subject and the info have different genders. Let’s try saying:\n“The building is a school.”\n\nThe subject: ٱَلْبِنَاءُ ʾalbināʾu (masc.) “the building” (u-state)\nThe info: مَدْرَسَةٌ madrasatun (fem.) “a school” (u-state)\n\nIn the same manner as before, we form the sentence by first writing the subject and then the info:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu madrasah.\n“The building is a school.”\nWe can also reverse this sentence:\nٱَلْمَدْرَسَةُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalmadrasatu bināʾ.\n“The school is a building .”\nSo we see that it is quite normal to have a sentence where the gender of the subject does not match the gender of the info.  This is because the nouns we have dealt with so far denote inanimate entities. If either the subject or the info denote animate beings, then in this case the subject and the info often do match each other in gender. For example, let’s try to form the sentence:\n“The mother is a teacher.”\nHere are the indiviual words that we will use to form the sentence:\n\nThe subject: “the mother”: ٱَلْأُمُّ ʾalʾummu (fem.) (u-state).\nThe info: “a teacher”. We have two words for “a teacher” in Arabic:\n\nمُعَلِّم muɛallium (masc.) “a (male) teacher”\nمُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) “a (female) teacher”.\n\nObviously, مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah would apply here so we put it in the u-state: مُعَلِّمَةٌ muɛallimatun (u-state).\n\nNow we can assemble the sentence:\nٱَلْأُمُّ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾalʾummu muɛallimah.\n“The mother is a teacherf.”\nIn the reverse sentence “The teacher is a mother.”, we again use the feminine noun مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) “a (female) teacher”, which is now the subject of the sentence, to match the feminine noun in the info ٱَلْأُمّ ʾalumm (fem.) “a mother”. So we get:\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ أُمٌّ.\nʾalmuɛallimatu ʾumm.\n“The teacherf is a mother.”\n\nHere is another example:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ أَبٌ.\nʾarrujulu ʾab.\n“The man is a father.”\n\nNow, let’s try a sentence where we are still dealing with animate beings but the nouns mismatches in grammatical gender.\nٱَلْأُمُّ شَخْصٌ.\nʾalʾummu s͡hak͡hṣ.\n“The mother is a person.”\nٱَلشَّخْصُ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾas͡hs͡hak͡hṣu muɛallimah.\n“The person is a (female) teacher.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ شَخْصٌ.\nʾalmuɛallimatu s͡hak͡hṣ.\n“The (female) teacher is a person.”\nIn the above examples, the grammatical genders mismatch between the subject and the info. But this is because we are matching with the physical gender of the person represented by the masculine noun شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ “a person”, not its grammatical gender.\nThe same effect is seen when using the word حَيَوان ḥayawān which is a masculine noun meaning “an animal”. It can be applied to both male and female animals. So we can say:\nٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرٌّ.\nʾalḥayawānu hirr.\n“The animal is a (male) cat.”\nand\nٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ.\nʾalḥayawānu hirrah.\n“The animal is a (female) cat.”",

    "section": "4.4 Detached pronouns",
    "text": "4.4 Detached pronouns\nPronouns, in Arabic, are special nouns that can be used in place of other nouns when it is known who is being referred to. This means that they can replace definite nouns only. Pronouns in English include words like “he”, “she”, “it”, “you”, “I”, etc.\nIn order to explain the usage of pronouns, we will first show a sentence with a noun subject:\n“The man is a teacher.”\nNow we you can replace the definite subject noun “the man” with the pronoun “he”:\n“He is a teacher.”\nIn Arabic there are a few different kinds of pronouns. Here we will learn detached pronouns. They are called detached pronouns because they are detached from other words. There are another set of pronouns called attached pronouns that we will learn later, if Allāh wills.\n\n4.4.1 Participants\nWhen talking about pronouns, it is beneficial to make use of a concept of grammar called participants.\nIn any kind of speech there are there can be up to three types of participants involved. A participant may be singular, i.e. consist of one individual, or plural, i.e., consist of more than one individual.\nThe three participants in speech are:\n\nThe speaker-participant. This is the participant who is speaking. When the speaker-participant refers to himself or herself (or themselves if plural) in English, then he/she/they use the pronouns “I”, “me”, “we”, and “us”.\nThe addressee-participant. This is the participant whom the speaker-participant is directly speaking to. When the speaker-participant refers to the addressee-participant in English, he uses the “you” pronoun.\nThe absentee-participant. This is the participant who is not being directly spoken to. Their only participation in the speech is that they are being referred to. When the speaker-participant refers to the absentee-participant in English, he uses the pronouns “he”, “him”, “she”, “her”, “it”, “they”, and “them”.\n\nIn this chapter we will learn the Arabic pronouns for the singular participants.\n\n\n4.4.2 Detached pronouns for the singular absentee-participant\nHere are the Arabic detached pronouns for the singular absentee-participant:\n\nsingular masculine absentee-participant: هُوَ huwa “he”.\nsingular feminine absentee-participant: هِيَ hiya “she”.\n\nHere are some examples of pair of sentences, each first with a noun, and then with a pronoun in place of the noun:\n\nٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾarrajulu muɛallim.\n“The man is a teacherm.”\nهُوَ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nhuwa muɛallim.\n“He is a (male) teacherm.”\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ طَالِبَةٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu ṭalibah.\n“The girl is a studentf.”\nهِيَ طَالِبَةٌ.\nhiya ṭalibah.\n“She is a studentf.”\nٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalbaytu bināʾ.\n“The house is a building.”\nهُوَ بِنَاءٌ.\nhuwa bināʾ.\n“It is a building.”\nNote that Arabic uses the pronoun هُوَ huwa “he” to refer to the inanimate object “the house”. This is because, as we know, all nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine. In translating the sentence to English we will employ the neutral pronoun “it” to make the sentence sound natural.\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu madrasah.\n“The building is a school.”\nهُوَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. huwa madrasah.\nor\nهِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. hiya madrasah.\n“It is a school.”\nNote that either هُوَ huwa “he” or هِيَ hiya “she” can be used in the above sentence because the gender of the subject ٱَلْبِنَاء ʾalbināʾ (masc.) “the building” mismatches the gender of the info مَدْرَسَة madrasah (fem.) “a school.”.\nIn such cases where the genders of the subject and the info do not match, then, generally speaking, the pronoun for either gender could be employed with the following guideline:\nPrefer to match the gender of the subject pronoun with the gender of the info, unless the noun being replaced with a pronoun is an animate being, in which case prefer to use the gender of the animate being.\nSo in the above sentence we will prefer to use هِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. hiya madrasah. because the info مَدْرَسَةٌ madrasatun “a school” is feminine.\nHere is an example with an animate being as the subject:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ إِنْسَانٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu īnsān.\n“The girl is a human.”\nهِيَ إِنْسَانٌ.\nhiya īnsān.\n“She is a human.”\nHere, if we replace the noun ٱَلْجَارِيَة ʾaljāriyah “the girl” with a pronoun, we will prefer to use هِيَ hiya “she”, because the girl is an animate being, even though the info إِنْسَانٌ ʾinsānun “a human” is masculine.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Detached pronouns for the singular addressee-participant and speaker-participant\nHere are the pronouns for the singular addressee-participant and speaker-participant:\n\nsingular masculine addressee-participant: أَنْتَ ʾanta “youm”.\nsingular feminine addressee-participant: أَنْتِ ʾanti “youf”.\nsingular speaker-participant: أَنَا ʾana “I”.\n\nNote that the addressee-participant pronoun “you” has separate pronouns for the masculine and the feminine while the speaker-participant pronoun “I” has the same pronoun for both genders. Examples with these pronouns:\n\nأَنْتَ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾanta muɛallim.\n“Youm are a teacherm.”\nأَنْتِ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾanti muɛallimah.\n“Youf are a teacherf.”\nأَنَا مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾana muɛallim.\n“I am a teacherm.”\nأَنَا مُعَلِّمَة.\nʾana muɛallimah.\n“I am a teacherf.”\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Definiteness of pronouns\nWe stated, and saw, that pronouns can replace definite nouns. This means that pronouns themselves are definite nouns (even though they are not prefixed by ٱَلْ ʾal “the”).\nThis fact will be useful in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n4.4.5 Rigidity of pronouns\nRemember in section @ref(flexibility-of-nouns), we talked about the flexibility of nouns. We said that nouns whose endings change with the noun’s state are called flexible nouns. Most nouns fall into this category.\nPronouns, however, are nouns whose endings don’t change with their state. Therefore they fall into the category of rigid nouns.",

It can also be interpreted as a noun-phrase, meaning “the teacher-man”, instead of the complete sentence “The man is the teacherm.” Therefore, in order to disambiguate and make it clear that we mean the complete sentence, a disambiguating pronoun is usually (but not always) inserted between the subject and the info. Disambiguating pronouns are detached pronouns that match the subject of the sentence in gender. With a disambiguating pronoun, the sentence above becomes:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ هُوَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ.\nʾarrajulu huwa -lmuɛallim.\n“The man is the teacherm.”\nThe disambiguating pronoun here is هُوَ huwa and is not translated.

A subject needs a certain amount of weight in order to be the first word in a sentence. And being definite gives it this needed weight. That is: “the man” is grammatically heavier than “a man”. So it is easier to start a sentence with “the man”.\nSo can we even have a sentence that has an indefinite subject? For example: \n\nA house is a building.\nA man is the teacher.\n\nYes, it is possible, but sentences where the subject is an indefinite noun are not as straightforward to express in Arabic. We will explore some ways of expressing them later if Allāh wills.",

    "text": "4.7 وَ wa- “and”, فَ fa- “so”/“and then”, and أَوْ ʾaw “or”\n\n4.7.1 وَ wa- “and”\nArabic uses the particle وَ wa to mean “and”. Being a one-letter particle, it is joined to the word after it without any space between it and the next word.\nوَمَدْرَسَةٌ\nwamadrasatun\n“and a school”\nوَ wa meaning “and” does not change the state of the noun following it. Examples:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَسْجِدٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu masjidun wamadrasah.\n“The building is a mosque and a school.”\nIf there are more than two words, then in English, only the final word usually has “and” and the rest are separated by commas in writing. In Arabic, however, each must have وَ and commas are not typically used.\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَسْجِدٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ وَمَكْتَبَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu baytun wamadrasatun wamaktabah\n“The building is a mosque, a school, and a library.” \nWe can also use وَ to begin and connect sentences. The following example is tehcnically two sentences, both beginning with وَ:\nوَٱلرَّجُلُ إِنْسَانٌ وَٱلْكَلْبُ حَيَوَانٌ\nwarrujulu ʾinṣānun wa-lkalbu ḥayawānun\n“And the man is a human and the dog is an animal.”\nUnlike as in English, this is not considered poor style. When translating such sentences to English, the first وَ is often left out, thus: “The man is a human and the dog is an animal.”\n\n\n4.7.2 فَ fa- “so”/“and then”\nThe word فَ fa- “so”/“and then” is comparable to وَ wa- “and”. فَ fa- “so”/“and then” gives a meaning of ordering, consequence, and subsequence that is missing in وَ wa- “and”. For example,\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَسْجِدٌ فَمَدْرَسَةٌ فَمَكْتَبَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu baytun famadrasatun famaktabah\n“The building is a mosque, and then a school, and then a library.”\nفَ fa- “so”/“and then”, too, is used to begin and connect sentences. Example,\nفَٱلرَّجُلُ إِنْسَانٌ وَٱلْكَلْبُ حَيَوَانٌ\nfarrujulu ʾinṣānun wa-lkalbu ḥayawānun\n“So the man is a human and the dog is an animal.”",

    "section": "5.2 True prepositions",
    "text": "5.2 True prepositions\nTrue prepositions are particles. Particles are a class of words, like nouns and verbs. Particles don’t have the properties of nouns. Thus, they cannot be definite or indefinite. They cannot be preceded by ٱَلْ al nor may they be tanwīned. And they don’t have state (u-state, a-state, i-state).\nHere is a list of the more common true prepositions:\n\n\n\nPreposition\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nبِ bi\nwith, by, next to\n\n\nلِ li\nfor, to\n\n\nفِي fī\nin\n\n\nعَلَىٰ ɛalā\non\n\n\nإِلَىٰ ʾilā\nto, toward\n\n\nمِنْ min\nfrom\n\n\nعَنْ ɛan\nfrom, about\n\n\nكَ ka\nlike\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nPrepositions that are a single letter (like بِ bi, ل li, كَ ka) are joined to the following noun in writing. Example:\nبِقَلَمٍ\nbiqalamin\n“with a pen”\nلِرَجُلٍ\nlirajulin\n“for a man”\nكَٱبْنٍ\nka-bnin\n“like a son”\nWhen a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with ٱَلْ al, the preposition is generally joined to the alif in the ٱَلْ al. The alif is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting hamzah). Example:\nبِٱلْقَلَمِ\nbi-lqalami\n“with the pen”\nIf the noun begins with a connecting hamzah then the ل in ٱَلْ gets an kasrah ◌ِ instead of its usual sukūn ◌ْ. We described this in section @ref(the-definite-article-with-nouns-with-an-initial-connecting-hamzah). Example:\nكَٱلِٱبْنِ\nka-li-bni\n“like the son”\nThe only exception is the preposition لِ li. When joined to a definite noun with ٱَلْ al, the alif in ٱَلْ is dropped and we write the two lāms together. Example:\nلِلرَّجُلِ\nli-rrajuli\n“for the man”\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ\nli-ljāriyati\n“for the girl”\nلِلِٱبْنِ\nli-li-bni\n“for the son”\nHowever, in this case, if the noun too starts with a lām, then we drop the entire ٱَلْ al (in writing, not in meaning). This is to avoid having three lāms joined to each other. Example:\nٱَللُّعْبَةُ\nʾalluɛbatu\n“the toy”\nbecomes\nلِلُّعْبَةِ\nli-lluɛbati\n“for the toy”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) لِللُّعْبَةِ\nThis is also true for the phrase:\nلِلَّـٰهِ\nlillāhi\n“for Allāh”\nwhich is formed from لِ + ٱللَّـٰهِ\nThe prepositions عَلَىٰ ɛalā “on” and إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” have a long-ā vowel at the end but it is written with a dotless yāʾ ىٰ instead of an alif. (We have already learned that some words are written this way in section @ref(a-vowel-written-with-a-ya).)\nPrepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:\nإِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ\nʾilā madrasatin\n“to a school”\nIf a preposition ends with a long vowel, then, as usual, it get shortened to a short vowel when it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting hamzah. Examples:\nفِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nfi -lbayti\n“in the house”\nإِلَى ٱبْنٍ\nʾila -bnin\n“to a son”\nIf a preposition ends with a sukūn ◌ْ and it is followed by a word that begins with a connecting hamzah, then the sukūn is changed to a short vowel according to the following rules:\n\nThe ending of the preposition عَنْ ɛan gets an kasrah and becomes عَنِ ɛani. Examples:\nعَنِ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nɛani -rrajuli\n“from the man”\nعَنِ ٱبْنٍ\nɛani -bnin\n“from the son”\nThe ending of the preposition مِنْ min gets an fat·ḥah if followed by the ٱَلْ al of a definite noun. Otherwise it gets an kasrah if followed by any other connecting hamzah. Examples:\nمِنَ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nmina -rrajuli\n“from the man”\nمِنِ ٱبْنٍ\nmini -bnin\n“from a son”",

    "text": "5.4 Attached pronouns\nWe have already learned detached pronouns هُوَ, هِيَ, and أَنَا in section @ref(detached-pronouns). Detached pronouns are the equivalent of “he”, “she”, and “I”, etc. They are used in place of nouns that are in the u-state.\nNow we will learn about attached pronouns. Attached pronouns are, more or less, the equivalent of “him”, “her”, and “me”, etc. They are used in place of nouns that are in the a-state and the i-state. One place where attached pronouns are used is when the replace the noun directly following a preposition.\nThe singular attached pronouns are listed below. The detached pronouns are included as well for easy comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nDetached pronoun\nAttached pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee\nهُوَ huwa “him”\nهُ -hu “him”\n\n\nFem. absentee\nهِيَ hiya “her”\nهَا -hā “her”\n\n\nMasc. addressee\nأَنْتَ ʾanta “you1,m”\nكَ -ka “you1,m”\n\n\nFem. addressee\nأَنْتِ ʾanti “you1,f”\nكِ -ki “you1,f”\n\n\nSpeaker\nأَنَا ʾana “I”\nي “me”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Attached pronouns with prepositions\nAs mentioned above, one place the attached pronouns are used are after prepositions. Here are some notes regarding how they attach to prepositions:\n\nGenerally, these pronouns attach to the last letter of the preposition before it. Examples:\n\nمِنْكَ minka “from you”\nمَعَهُ maɛahu “with him”\nعَنْهَا ɛanhā “from her”\n\nThe ىٰ ā ending of prepositions become ◌َيْ -ay when attaching an attached pronoun. Examples:\n\nإِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to her”\nعَلَيْكَ ɛalayka “on youm”\n\nThe pronoun هُ -hu “him” becomes هِ hi when it is preceded by the vowels ◌ِ -i, ◌ِي -ī, or the semi-vowel ◌َيْ -ay. So we get\n\nبِهِ bihi “with him”\nفِيهِ fīhi “in him”\nإِلَيْهِ ʾilayhi “to him”\n\nThe attached pronoun for the speaker deserves special attention. The pronoun itself is the letter ي. But it has two variants:\n\n◌ِي -ī\n◌ِيَ -iya \n\nGenerally, both of these variants cause the final letter of the word before them, if a consonant, to have an kasrah ◌ِ, regardless of the whether or not that letter originally had an kasrah. Examples:\n\nلِي lī and لِيَ liya “for me”\nبِي bī and بِي biya “with/by me”\nمَعِي maɛī and مَعِيَ maɛiya “together with me”\nعِنْدِي ɛindī and عِنْدِيَ ɛindiya “at me”\n\nBetween these two, variants, ◌ِي -ī is more commonly used generally, except in the cases described in the next point, below:\nFor any word that ends with a long vowel (-ā, -ī, or -ū) or a semi-vowel (-ay or -aw), the variant ◌ِي -ī for the speaker attached pronoun is not used. Instead, only the variant يَ -ya may be used with such words.\nPrepositions that fall under this category are فِي fī, عَلَىٰ ɛalā, إِلَىٰ ʾilā, and لَدَىٰ ladā. Furthermore, the ىٰ -ā ending in these will become ◌َيْ ay instead when attaching the pronoun.\nIn addition, the pronoun يَ -ya will not cause the final letter of word before it to have an kasrah because it does that only to consonants, not to vowels or semivowels.\nSo we get:\n\nيَ + فِي = فِيَّ fiyya “in me”\nيَ + إِلَيْ = إِلَيَّ ʾilayya “to me”\nيَ + عَلَيْ = عَلَيَّ ɛalayya “on me”\nيَ + لَدَيْ = لَدَيَّ ladayya “at me”.\n\nThe preposition كَ ka “like” is not used with any attached pronoun. So, for example, we don’t say:\n\n\\(\\times\\) كَهُ kahu for “like him.”\n\nInstead, we will learn another method to express this meaning in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\nThe word “between”, because of its meaning, is typically used with two or more individuals. For example, “between us”, “between you and him”, etc. In Arabic, when the pseudo-preposition بَيْنَ bayna is used with a singular attached pronoun, it is repeated. For example,\n\nبَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ baynī wabaynaka “between me and you”",

    "text": "5.6 Sentences and phrases with prepositions\nWe have seen how a noun can be used after a preposition to get a prepositional phrase, for example:\nفِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nfi -lbayti\n“in the house” \nWe can put an indefinite noun in front of this structure:\n\nرَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nrajulun fi -lbayti\n“a man in the house”\nThis is a phrase and not a complete sentence. Note that the preposition فِي fī “in” only puts the noun after it (ٱلْبَيْتِ ʾalbayti “the house”) in the i-state. It has no effect on the state of the noun before it (رَجُلٌ rajulun “a man”). In this case, it is in the u-state.\nInstead of an indefnite noun, we can also put a definite noun in front of the prepositional phrase. Now the resulting structure can, in general, have two meanings: (i) a complete sentence, and (ii) an incomplete sentence. For example,\n\nٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nʾarrujulu fi -lbayti\n(i) “The man is in the house.”\n(ii) “The man in the house”\nUsually, it will be clear from the context which of the two meanings is valid. For example, the second meaning, “The man in the house”, can be part of a complete sentence: \nٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾarrujulu fi -lbayti muɛallim.\n“The man in the house is a teacherm.”",

But it is possible that he does not own it and that someone else has lent it to him.\n\nThere is some degree of overlap in meaning and you will get a feeling of which preposition is more appropriate in which circumstance as you progress in your learning, if Allah wills.

    "section": "6.2 Arabic word roots",
    "text": "6.2 Arabic word roots\nWe take this opportunity to learn about Arabic roots. Native Arabic words, both nouns and verbs, are generally derived from roots. Most roots are comprised of three letters. A smaller number are comprised of four or more letters.\nWords are derived from their roots according to patterns. In traditional Arabic grammar studies, the root فعل is used as a paradigm for three-letter roots to showcase word and meaning patterns.\nSo for example, the word بَيْت bayt “a house” is derived from the root بيت. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can see that the pattern of the word بَيْت bayt is فَعْل faɛl. The أَمْر ʾamr “a matter” is derived from the root ءمر. Its pattern is also فَعْل faɛl.\nSimilarly, the word مَكْتَب maktab “a library” is derived from the root كتب. And مَلْعَب malɛab “a playground” is derived from the root لعب. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can see that the pattern of both these words is مَفْعَل mafɛal. Here, the letter م m is an extraneous letter added to form the words and is not part of their roots.\nNot only nouns, but verbs, too, are derived from roots. All verbs are derived from their roots in a fixed set of patterns called forms which are numbered 1 onward. For example, the perfect form 2 verb pattern is فَعَّلَ faɛɛala and the perfect form 3 verb pattern is فَاعَلَ fāɛala. There are approximately 9-10 forms that are in common usage. In addition, there are a few higher order forms (11 onward) that are less common. In this chapter will study the perfect form 1 verb only.",

The first and the final letter always have an fat·ḥah while the middle letter’s vowel is variable. It may have an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or an ḍammah, depending on the verb. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can say that the form 1 verb occurs in the patterns فَعَلَ, فَعِلَ, and فَعُلَ.\nA good dictionary will tell us the middle vowel mark of a particular verb. However, as a trend, the fat·ḥah is the most common for the middle vowel mark, followed by the kasrah, while the ḍammah is the least common.\nInterestingly, there can exist multiple verbs from the same root, each with its own distinct meaning, that differ only in the vowel mark on the middle letter. An example of two such verbs is:\n\nحَسَبَ ḥasaba “calculated”\nحَسِبَ ḥasiba “deemed”\n\nYou can see above how the verb كَتَبَ kataba “wrote” is derived from the root كتب. We have already, by the way, learned another word derived from this root: the noun كِتَاب kitāb “a book”, which is on the pattern فِعَال fiɛāl. Note how both the verb and the noun derived from this root have a meaning that is common and has to do with writing or of something written. In a similar manner, you will often see that words derived from the same root generally share some common meaning, although this common meaning may not always be obvious or straightforward.",

    "section": "6.4 Verbal sentences",
    "text": "6.4 Verbal sentences\nWe have already learned of nounal sentences. Here we will learn of a new type of sentence called a verbal sentence. A verbal sentence is one that begins with a verb.\nWhen a verb is in a sentence, it requires a doer. The doer is a noun which represents the person who does the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence “The boy went.”, the noun “the boy” is the doer of the verb.\n\n6.4.1 Verbs with a masculine doer noun\nConsider the sentence:\n“The boy went.”\nIn order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulām.\n“The boy went.”\nذَهَبَ d͡hahaba “went” is the verb and ٱلْغُلَامُ alg͡hulāmu “the boy” is the doer. Note how the doer is in the u-state. Also note that in English the doer comes before the verb whereas in Arabic the doer comes after the verb in sentence word order. We can state this as a rule of Arabic grammar:\nIn Arabic, every verb in a sentence shall have a doer noun. The doer noun shall be in the u-state and shall come after the verb in sentence word order.\n\nIn the above example the doer noun was definite, but a doer may be indefinite too. Example:\nذَهَبَ رَجُلٌ إِلَىَ ٱلسُّوقِ.\nd͡hahaba rajulun ʾila -ssūq.\n“A man went to the market.”\nIn the above sentence, the doer noun رَجُلٌ rajulun is indfinite.\n\n\n6.4.2 Verbs with a feminine doer noun\nNow consider the sentence:\n“A girl went.”\nIn order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyah.\n“A girl went.”\nNote that we have modified the verb by adding on the letter تْ at the end. This تْ is used when the doer is ia feminine noun. It is called the تْ of femininity.\nIf the word following the noun begins with a connecting hamzah then we add a helper vowel to the تْ and it becomes تِ. Examples:\nجَلَسَتِ ٱلْهِرَّةُ عَلَى ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.\njalasati -lhirratu ɛala -lkursiyyi.\n“The catf sat on the chair.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلطِّفْلَةُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibati -ṭṭiflatu fi -lbayt.\n“The childf played in the house.”",

    "section": "6.5 Verbs with doees",
    "text": "6.5 Verbs with doees\n\n6.5.1 The direct doee\nConsider the sentence:\n“The man wrote a book.”\nIn this sentence, “wrote” is the verb, “the man” is the doer, and “a book” is what we shall call the doee. In fact, it is what we shall call a direct doee because the verb directly takes the doee without an intervening preposition. A doee is the noun to whom the action of the verb is done.\nIn Arabic, we will express the sentence “The man wrote a book.” by saying:\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.\nkataba -rrajulu kitābā.\n“The man wrote a book.”\nNote how in Arabic the doee كِتَابًا kitāban “a book” is in the a-state. This is because, in Arabic, verbs shall cause a direct doee to be in the a-state. This is true whether the direct doee is definite or indefinite. Here is another example:\n\nسَأَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.\nsaʾalati -lʾummu -ljāriyah.\n“The mother questioned the girl.”\nNote again how ٱلْجَارِيَةَ aljāriyata “the girl” is in the a-state because it is a direct doee.\n\n\n6.5.2 Multiple direct doees\nSome verbs can take more than one direct doee. In this case, all direct doees shall be in the a-state. For example,\nجَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُسْلِمًا.\njaɛala -llāhu -rrajula muslimā.\n“Allāh made the man a Muslim.”\nIn this sentence both ٱلرَّجُلَ arrajula “the man” and مُسْلِمًا musliman “a Muslim” are direct doees of the verb جَعَلَ jaɛala and therefore both are placed in the a-state.\n\n\n6.5.3 The indirect doee\nInstead of, or in addition to, direct doees, some verbs take an indirect doee. An indirect doee is one before which there is a preposition. For example, in English we might say:\n“The man looked at the moon.”\nIn this sentence, “the moon” is an indirect doee because it is preceded by the preposition “at”. Similarly, in Arabic, we will say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ إِلَى ٱلْقَمَرِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu ʾila -lqamar.\n“The man looked at the moon.”\nIn this sentence ٱَلْقَمَرِ alqamari “the moon” is an indirect doee of the verb نَظَرَ naḍ͡hara “looked” because it is preceded by the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to”. The preposition, as usual, causes the word after it (the indirect doee ٱَلْقَمَرِ ʾalqamari) to be in the i-state, as opposed to the a-state of the direct doee.\nNote also, that the verb “looked” in English used the preposition “at” whereas the Arabic verb نَظَرَ naḍ͡hara used the preopsition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” for the same meaning. This is very common and you should not expect Arabic to use exact counterparts of the prepositions used in English. In fact, everytime you learn a new verb, you should also learn the prepositions that go with it.\nIt is also possible for the same verb to take different prepositions with possibly different meanings. So, for example, we can say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْأَمْرِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu fi -lʾamri.\n“The man looked into the matter.” \nIt may also be possible for the same verb to take a direct doee. So we could also say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمَكْتُوبَ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu -lmaktūba fi -lkitābi.\n“The man viewed what was written in the book.” \nA good dictionary will tell us which prepositions are used with indirect doees with a given verb and also whether it takes a direct doee.\nSome verbs take a direct doee and another indirect doee, both at the same time. For example,\nسَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾala -lg͡hulāmu -lmuɛallimata ɛan ʾamr.\n“The boy asked the teacherf about a matter.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةَ ʾalmuɛallimata “the teacherf” is the direct doee, and therefore it is in the a-state. أَمْرٍ ʾamrin “a matter” is an indirect doee, and so it is in the i-state. The preposition عَنْ ɛan is translated, here, as “about”.\nIt is also possible that an English verb may take a direct doee, while the corresponding Arabic verb may only take an indirect doee. The reverse is also quite possible. For example,\nغَفَرَ ٱللَّـٰهُ لِلْمُسْلِمِ.\ng͡hafara -llāhu lilmuslimi.\n“Allāh forgave the Muslim.”\nThe verb “forgave” in English takes a direct doee for the person who is forgiven. In Arabic, however, the corresponding verb غَفَرَ g͡hafara “forgave” takes the forgiven person as an indirect doee, using the preposition لِ li.",

    "section": "6.6 Verbs with doer pronouns",
    "text": "6.6 Verbs with doer pronouns\nWe have learned that a pronoun is a special kind of noun that can be used to replace a definite noun. And we have already learned two category of pronouns in Arabic:\n\nDetached pronouns, like هُوَ, هِيَ, etc.\nAttached pronouns, like هُ, هَا, etc.\n\nNow we would like to replace the doer noun of a verb with a pronoun. For example, instead of saying:\n“The man went.”\nwe would like to say:\n“He went.”\nFor this we will have to learn a third category of pronoun pronouns called doer pronouns for perfect verbs. doer pronouns are of two types: (i) expressed and (ii) implied.\nHere we list the singular doer pronouns in Arabic.\n\n\n\nSingular participant\ndoer pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee (“he”)\nimplied\n\n\nFem. absentee (“she”)\nimplied\n\n\nMasc. addressee (“you1,m”)\nتَ -ta\n\n\nFem. addressee (“you1,f”)\nتِ -ti\n\n\nSpeaker (“I”)\nتُ -tu\n\n\n\nWe will now give an explanation of the above doer pronouns.\n\n6.6.1 doer pronouns for the singular absentee-participant (“he”/“she”)\nThe doer pronouns of the absentee-participant are the equivalent of “he” and “she”. For example, let’s try to replace the doer-noun “the man” in the sentence: “The man went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nd͡hahaba -rrajul.\n“The man went.”\nWhen we replace the doer noun ٱلرَّجُل ʾarrujul “the man” with the doer pronoun “he”, we get:\nذَهَبَ.\nd͡hahab.\n“[He] went.”\nAs you can see, all we did was omit the doer-noun ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrujul, and we didn’t add any word to replace it as the doer pronoun. This is because the doer pronoun for “he” is implied and automatically comes into place when we omit the doer noun.\nThe doer pronoun for “she” is similarly implied. For example, if we replace the doer noun in the sentence:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ كِتَابًا.\nqaraʾati -ljāriyatu kitābā.\n“The girl read a book.”\nwe get:\nقَرَأَتْ كِتَابًا.\nqaraʾat kitābā.\n“[She] read a book.”\n\n6.6.1.1 Explanation of implied pronouns\nWhy do we have to go to all the trouble of saying that the doer-pronouns of the singular absentee-participants “he” and “she” are implied? Why can’t we simply say that there are no doer-pronouns for the singular absentee-participants?\nThe reason is that  we need to be able to state, as a rule of grammar, that every verb needs to have its own doer, whether expressed or implied. Later, if Allāh wills, when we study verbs with dual and plural doers we will see that this will make a difference in the formation of the verb. \n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Doer pronouns for the singular addressee (“you1”) and speaker (“I”) participants\nIt is only the doer pronouns for the singular absentee participant that are implied for perfect verbs. The doer pronouns for the singular addressee and speaker participants are expressed. The expressed doer pronouns are attached to the verb.\nHere we show how the expressed doer pronouns are attached to the verb using the root paradigm فعل. The middle root letter (ع) has an fat·ḥah ◌َ here but this vowel will vary for other verbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular participant\nDoer pronoun\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAddressee “you1,m”\nتَ -ta\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\n\n\nAddressee “you1,f”\nتِ -ti\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\n\n\nSpeaker “I”\nتُ -tu\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\n\n\n\nNote also how the expressed singular doer pronouns modify the verb by replacing the fat·ḥah ◌َ on its final letter by a sukūn ◌ْ.\nFurthermore, note how the doer pronoun for the addressed person “you” is differentiated for masculine and feminine doers whereas the doer pronoun for the speaking person “I” is the same for both genders.\nHere are some examples of sentences with expressed doer pronouns:\nكَتَبْتَ كِتَابًا.\nkatabta kitābā.\n“Youm wrote a book.”\nذَهَبْتُ.\nd͡hahabt.\n“I went.”\nThe above sentence ends with the doer pronoun, so the vowel-mark on the doer pronoun is not pronounced (d͡hahabt). So, how would be know which doer pronoun it is? That is, does the sentence say “I went.” or “Youm went.” or “Youf. went.”? The answer is that the sentence by itself is ambiguous and context would tell us which of the three options is intended.\nTake care to note that the singular doer pronouns modify the final letter of the basic verb, whereas the تْ of femininity does not. So make sure you see the difference in the following two sentences:\nقَرَأْتِ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nqaraʾti -lkitāb.\n“Youf read the book.”\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْكتَابَ.\nqaraʾati -lkitāb.\n“She read the book.”\n\n\n6.6.3 Assimilation of the doer pronoun\nIf the final letter of the root of a verb is ت, then it gets assimililated with the ت which is the doer pronoun and only one ت, representing both, is written. Consider the verb:\nسكت سَكَتَ sakata “became quiet”\nWhen we add a expressed doer pronoun to this verb, we get:\nسَكَتُّ\nsakattu\n“I became quiet”\nسَكَتَّ\nsakatta\n“You1,m became quiet”\nسَكَتِّ\nsakatti\n“You1,f became quiet”\nAssimilation is treated in more detail in chapter/appendix TODO.",

    "section": "6.7 Verbs with doee pronouns",
    "text": "6.7 Verbs with doee pronouns\nJust like doer nouns may be replaced with doer pronouns, so, too, may doee nouns be replaced with doee pronouns. Doee pronouns are also attached to the end of the verb but they don’t modify the vowel on the final letter of the verb. The doee pronouns are the same attached pronouns that are also used with prepositions:\n\n\n\nSingular participant\nDoee pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee\nهُ -hu “him”\n\n\nFem. absentee\nهَا -hā “her”\n\n\nMasc. addressee\nكَ -ka “you1,m”\n\n\nFem. addressee\nكِ -ki “you1,f”\n\n\nSpeaker\nي “me”\n\n\n\nHere are some notes regarding their usage:\n\nDoee pronouns shall always be attached to the verb. So if there is a doer noun then it shall be placed after the attached doee pronoun. For example:\nسَأَلَهُ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nsaʾalahu -lg͡hulām.\n“The boy asked him.”\nIf however, the doer is also a pronoun, then it shall be attached first to the verb and then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the doer pronoun. For example,\nسَأَلْتُكِ.\nsaʾaltuk.\n“I asked youf.”\nIf the doer pronoun is implied, then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the verb again directly with only a possible تْ of femininity intervening. For example:\nسَأَلَهَا.\nsaʾalahā.\n“He asked her.”\nسَأَلَتْكَ.\nsaʾalatk.\n“She asked youm.”\nIf the doee pronoun هُ -hu “him” is preceded by the vowels i, ī, or ay then it shall instead become هِ hi with no change in meaning. (We’ve already learned this rule.) For example,\nسَأَلْتِهِ.\nsaʾaltih\n“Youf asked him.”\nAn intervening ن is always used between the verb and the speaker-participant doee pronoun variants ◌ِي -ī and ◌ِيَ -iya. Remember that these pronouns force any consonant before it to have a kasrah ◌ِ. Therefore, the combination will be written as نِي -nī and نِيَ -niya respectively. For example:\nسَأَلَنِي رَجُلٌ.\nsaʾalanī rajul.\n“A man asked me.”\nسَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nsaʾalaniya -rrajul.\n“The man asked me.”\n\nIf there is an expressed doer pronoun, the intervening ن shall come after it so that the ن is always connected to the doee pronoun. For example,\nسَأَلْتَنِي.\nsaʾaltanī\n“Youm asked me.”\nBy the way, we have already seen this intervening ن before when it was used with some prepositions, e.g. مِنِّي minnī, عَنِّي ɛannī, and لَدُنِّي ladunnī \nThe variant ◌ِي -ī is, in general, more commonly used, However, when the noun following it begins with a connecting hamzah then the variant ◌ِيَ -ya is preferred. That is why we used the variant ◌ِيَ -ya when it was followed by a connecting hamzah (سَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.), and the variant ◌ِي -ī when it was not followed by a connecting hamzah (سَأَلَنِي رَجُلٌ.). But this preference is not mandatory. So it is allowed for ◌ِي -ī to be used when followed by a connecting hamzah. When this happens, the long vowel -ī will be shortened to -i in connecting it to the next word, although the ◌ِي is retained in writing. For example,\nسَأَلَنِي ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nsaʾalani -rrajul.\n“The man asked me.”",

This same doer is doing the action of multiple verbs: “entered”, “ate”, “drank”, and “exited”. When we try to express this sentence in Arabic we must remember that every verb shall have its own doer, and that the doer shall occur after it in sentence word order. So we will say:\nدَخَلْتُ ٱلْغُرْفَةَ فَأَكَلْتُ فَشَرِبْتُ فَخَرَجْتُ.\ndak͡haltu -lg͡hurfata faʾakaltu fas͡haribtu fak͡harajt.\n“I entered the room and then I ate and then I drank and then I exited.”\nNote also, that we need to replace the commas by connecting particles like وَ wa- “and”, or فَ fa- “so”/“and then”, etc. We chose فَ fa- which implies consequence or subsequence between the individual events.\nLet’s now try this sentence with a doer noun instead of a doer pronoun:\n“The girl entered the room, ate, drank, and exited.”\nHere is our translation:\nدَخَلَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْغُرْفَةَ فَأَكَلَتْ فَشَرِبَتْ فَخَرَجَتْ.\ndak͡halati -ljāriyatu -lg͡hurfata faʾakalat fas͡haribat fak͡harajat.\n“The girl entered the room and then she ate and then she drank and then she exited.”\nEach verb again has its own doer, which is coming after the verb in sentence word order. The doer of the first verb دَخَلَ dak͡hala “entered” is the noun ٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ʾaljāriyatu “the girl”. The subsequent verbs all have doers too but they are the implied doer pronouns for the singular feminine absentee participant. That is why we don’t write them. Note also that every verb has the تْ of femininity attached to it to indicate its singular feminine absentee doer.",

    "section": "6.9 Order of words in a sentence",
    "text": "6.9 Order of words in a sentence\n\n6.9.1 Changing the order of words for emphasis\nIn Arabic, the doer always follows the verb. So the normal order of a sentence is verb-doer-doee. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.\nkataba -rrajulu kitābā.\n“The man wrote a book.”\nHowever, we will often come across sentences like:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.\nʾarrajulu kataba kitābā.\nIt may appear as if ٱَلرَّجُلُ arrajulu is the doer and it is coming before the verb كَتَبَ kataba. But actually, this is not the case. As a matter of fact, this sentence is basically a nounal sentence.\nHere ٱَلرَّجُلُ arrajulu “the man” is the subject of the sentence, and كَتَبَ كِتَابًا kataba kitāban “he wrote a book”, itself a verbal sentence with an implied doer pronoun, is the info about the subject. So the translation of the sentence is technically:\n“The man, he wrote a book.”\nHowever, this can be an awkward translation so we will usually translate it as “The man wrote a book.” \nThe question arises: if both sentences above have the same translation, then why would we say ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا ʾarrajulu kataba kitāban instead of the more normal كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا kataba -rrajulu kitāban? The answer is that this change in the sentence’s word order is done in order to give more emphasis to the doer, as if to say:\n“The man wrote a book.”\nSo in Arabic, the order of words is generally more flexible than in English and this is often used to give emphasis to certain words.\n\n\n6.9.2 Verbs pull definite nouns towards them\nWhen a verb has a doer noun and a doee noun, the normal order of words in a sentence is: verb, doer noun, doee noun. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba -rrajulu -lkitāba.\n“The man wrote the book.”\nThere is a tendency, in Arabic, for verbs to pull definite nouns towards them. This means that if there are any indefinite nouns, they have a tendency to get pushed father away. So, for example, if a verb’s doer is an indefinite noun and the doee is a definite noun, the doee will often (but not always) precede the doer. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ رَجُلٌ.\nkataba -lkitāba rajul.\n“A man wrote the book.”\nThe vowel-marks at the end of the nouns, and context, will tell us which is the doer and which is the doee. In this particular example, it was optional, and not mandatory to make the definite doee precede the doer in sentence word order. So we could have also said, instead:\nكَتَبَ رَجُلٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba rajuluni -lkitāb.\n“A man wrote the book.”\nNow let’s take a look at sentences with pronouns. Remember that pronouns are a category of nouns, and also (from section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns)) that they are definite nouns. In fact they are stronger in definiteness than words that are made definite using ٱَلْ. This because if when we say “The man wrote the book.” instead of “A man wrote the book.”, we assume that everyone knows which man we are referring to. Now if we replace “the man” with the pronoun “he”: “He wrote the book.”, then this assumption becomes stronger. “He” is, in a sense, more definite than “the man.”.\nSo now, when the direct doee noun ٱلْكِتَابَ ʾalkitāba “the book” is replaced with the pronoun “it”, the doee pronoun must be attached to the verb, and then the doer noun follows the doee pronoun:\nكَتَبَهُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nkatabahu -rrajulu.\n“The man wrote it.”\nThis can be seen as a mandatory case of the verb pulling the definite noun toward it.\nNow, consider a sentence with an indirect doee. Again, the normal order of words in a sentence is verb, doer noun, preposition, doee noun. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu ʾila -lmadrasah.\n“The boy went to the school.”\nNow, if we replace the indirect doee noun ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ. ʾalmadrasati “the school” with the pronoun “it”, the indirect doee pronoun هَا -hā “it” is attached, not to the verb, but to the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā thus: إِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to it”. So it possible to preserve the original order of words in the sentence:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَيْهَا.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu ʾilayhā.\n“The boy went to it.”\nWhile the above sentence is correct, it is in fact more common to place the preposition and doee pronoun إِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to it” right after the verb, and before the doer noun, thus:\nذَهَبَ إِلَيْهَا ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba ʾilayha -lg͡hulāmu.\n“The boy went to it.”\nThis is because the pronoun هَا -hā “it” is stronger in definiteness than ٱلْغُلَام ʾalg͡hulām “the boy”. So the verb has a stronger pull towards it. \nThis ordering of words due to the attractive pull of the verb is largely learned by experience. The more you read Arabic, the better feel you will get for it, if Allāh wills.",

    "text": "6.12 Separating doee pronouns from the verb\nFIXME: move to imperfect verb chapter\nWe have mentioned that doee pronouns are attached to the verb. Sometimes there is a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb. When separating the doee pronoun from the verb, it is instead attached to the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā. So then we get the following doee pronouns:\n\n\n\nPerson\nDoee pronoun\n\n\n\n\nAbsent person (masc.) “him”\nإِيَّاهُ ʾiyyāhu\n\n\nAbsent person (fem.) “her”\nإِيَّاهَا ʾiyyāhā\n\n\nAddressed person (masc.) “youmasc.”\nإِيَّاكَ ʾiyyāka\n\n\nAddressed person (fem.) “youfem.”\nإِيَّاكِ ʾiyyāki\n\n\nSpeaking person (masc. and fem.) “me”\nإِيَّايَ ʾiyyāya\n\n\n\nNote that for the speaking person “me”, there is no intervening ن between the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā and the doee pronoun. Note also that only يَ -ya is allowed to be attached to the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā. This is because ◌ِي -ī is not permitted to be used with words that end in a long vowel (-ā, -ī, or -ū) or a semi-vowel (-ay or -aw). And the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā ends with the long-vowel ā.\nBut we may ask why is there a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb? This can occur for a couple of reasons:\n\nIf there are multiple doee pronouns, only one of them can be attached to the verb. Example,\nضَرَبَتْنِي وَإِيَّاهُ.\nḍarabatnī wa ʾiyyāhu.\n“She hit me and him.”\nIf the doee is placed before the verb for emphasis. Example,\nإِيَّايَ ضَرَبَتْ.\nʾiyyāya ḍarabat.\n“She hit me.”",

For example:\n“a big car”\nThe adjective “big” can also be used as the info of a sentence, describing the subject noun. For example:\n“The car is big.”\n\nBut the adjective “big” cannot be used by itself as a noun, for example, as the subject of a sentence.

    "section": "7.5 Adjectival nouns in Arabic and genderizability",
    "text": "7.5 Adjectival nouns in Arabic and genderizability\n\nArabic does not have adjectives. It only has adjectival nouns.\nThe word صَغِير ṣag͡hīr is an example of an indefinite adjectival noun in Arabic. It describes the quality of being “small” or “little”. It can be used to denote any person, animal, or things that can be described as being small. Technically we could translate it as “a little onem” or “a small onem”.\nBeing a noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr, like all other nouns in Arabic, will have a grammatical gender. Since it does not end with a feminine marker like ة, we can state that صَغِير ṣag͡hīr is a masculine noun.\nAdjectival nouns, typically, are genderizable. This means that we can feminize صَغِير ṣag͡hīr (masc.) to get the feminine noun. We will feminize صَغِير ṣag͡hīr (masc.) with the feminine marker ة to get the feminine adjectival noun صَغِيرَة ṣag͡hīrah (fem.) “a little onef”.\nGenerally, the dictionary will typically only supply the masculine adjectival noun. And we are expected to know how to feminize it to get the feminine adjectival noun.\nAs opposed to adjectival nouns, common nouns are not genderizable. So, for example, if we know that the noun غُلَام g͡hulām “a boy” exists, we cannot assume that we can feminize it, by using the feminine marker ة, for example, getting: \\(\\times\\) غُلَامَة g͡hulāmah. This would be a misguided attempt to obtain the meaning for “a girl” in Standard Arabic. Instead, we have to look up the Arabic word for “a girl” in the dictionary separately, and we find that it is جَارِيَة jāriyah.\nMany times times, a masculine/feminine common noun pair will exist, that differ only by the feminine marker ة. For example:\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” and ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah “a daughter”.\nمُعَلِّم muɛallim “a teacherm” and مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah “a teacherf”\n\nThis does not indicate that the common noun is genderizable. Rather, when the common noun masc./fem. pair has a meaning that is derived from a verb or an adjective (like مُعَلِّم/مُعَلِّمَة), then the masculine/feminine pair are co-derived as separate non-genderizable words. We will discuss this in more detail in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\nAnd when the common noun masc./fem. pair has a primitive (non-verbal and non-adjectival) meaning, (like ٱِبْن/ٱِبْنَة), then this is only a coincidence. We alluded to this in section @ref(related-nouns-for-male-and-female-animate-beings).\n\n7.5.1 Examples of Arabic adjectival nouns\nHere are some examples of Arabic adjectival nouns that we will use in this chapter.\n\n\n\nArabic adjectival noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nكَبِير kabīr\na big one\n\n\nصَغِير ṣag͡hīr\na small one\n\n\nطَيِّب ṭayyib\na good one\n\n\nقَدِيم qadīm\nan old one\n\n\nجَدِيد jadīd\na new one\n\n\nطَوِيل ṭawīl\na long/tall one\n\n\nوَاسِع wāsiɛ\na wide one\n\n\nعَرَبِيّ ɛarabiyy\nan Arab\n\n\nمَشْهُور mas͡h·hūr\na famous one",

    "text": "7.6 The attribute and the attributee in attributee-attribute phrases\nLet’s learn how attributee-attribute phrases are formed in Arabic.\nWe learned in section @ref(terminology-the-attribute-and-the-attributee) above that attributee-attribute phrases consist of a attribute and a attributee.\nIn English attributee-attribute phrases, like “the small house”, the adjective attribute (“small”) comes before the attributee (“house”). Also, only one definite article (“the”) is used before the entire noun-phrase.\nHere is the equivalent Arabic attributee-attribute phrase:\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe adjectival noun attribute ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” comes after the attributee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house”.\nBoth the adjectival noun attribute ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” and the attributee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” get the definite article ٱَلْ “the”.\nThe adjectival noun attribute ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” is genderized to match the attributee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” in gender.\nThe adjectival noun attribute ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” matches the attributee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” in state. In this example, they were both in the u-state but we will see examples in the other states as well.\nThe word-for-word equivalence of the above attributee-attribute phrase is “the small-one house” but we will usually give the more natural translation: “the small house”\n\nLet’s try another example: let’s try to translate the sentence: “The little girl took a new book from the good mother.”\nHere is the sentence in Arabic:\nأَخَذَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ كِتَابًا جَدِيدًا مِنْ ٱلْأُمِّ ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ.\nʾak͡had͡hati -ljāriyatu -ṣṣag͡hīratu kitaban jadīdan mina -lʾummi -ṭṭayyibah.\n“The little girl took a new book from the good mother.”\nThis sentence has three attributee-attribute phrases. We will analyze each one individually:\n\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ\nʾaljāriyatu -ṣṣag͡hīratu\n“the little girl”\nIn this phrase the definite feminine noun ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ʾaljāriyatu is the doer of the verb أَخَذَ ʾak͡had͡ha “took”. Therefore it is in the u-state. It is also the attributee in the attributee-attribute phrase. Its attribute ٱَلصَّغِيرَةُ ʾaṣṣag͡hīratu follows the attributee and is made to match the attributee in state (u-state), gender (feminine), and definiteness (definite).\nكِتَابًا جَدِيدًا\nkitāban jadīdan\n“a new book”\nIn this phrase the indefinite masculine noun كِتَابًا kitāban is the direct doee of the verb أَخَذَ ʾak͡had͡ha “took”. Therefore it is in the a-state. It is also the attributee in the attributee-attribute phrase. Its attribute جَدِيدًا jadīdan follows the attributee and is made to match the attributee in state (a-state), gender (masculine), and definiteness (indefinite).\nٱَلْأُمِّ ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ\nʾalʾummi -ṭṭayyibati\n“the good mother”\nIn this phrase the definite feminine noun ٱلْأُمِّ ʾalʾummi is following the preposition مِنْ min “from”. Therefore it is in the i-state. It is also the attributee in the attributee-attribute phrase. Its attribute ٱَلطَيِّبَةِ ʾaṭṭayyibati follows the attributee and is made to match the attributee in state (i-state), gender (feminine), and definiteness (definite).\nNote carefully that the attribute matches the attributee in gender, not necessarily in having the same ة ending. The feminine adjectival noun attribute ٱَلطَيِّبَة ʾaṭṭayyibah is still formed using the feminine marker ة, despite the feminine attributee ٱَلْأُمّ not having the ة feminine marker.\n\n\nSometimes, a common noun of one gender is used to refer to persons of either gender. For example:\n\nthe noun شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ is itself a masculine noun but it may be used to refer to both male and female persons.\n\nIf such a noun is a attributee, then we will prefer to match the attribute to the grammatical gender of the noun, not the physical gender of the person it is referring to. For example:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ شَخْصٌ طَيِّبٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu s͡hak͡hṣun ṭayyib.\n“The girl is a good person.”\nSee how we preferred to use the masculine adjectival noun طَيِّب ṭayyib instead of using the feminine طَيِّبَة ṭayyibah. But the feminine adjectival noun طَيِّبَة ṭayyibah would also have been acceptable.1",

    "text": "7.7 The Adjectival noun as the info of a sentence\n\n7.7.1 Indefinite adjectival noun\nLet’s see how to use Arabic adjectival nouns as the info of a sentence.\n\n\nIn the above sentence, the indefinite adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a small one” is used as the info of a sentence. Its indefiniteness and u-state is indicated by the tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ on its end.\nWhen an adjectival noun is the info of a sentence, then it shall be genderized to match the gender of the subject noun. The subject noun in this case (ٱَلْبَيْت) is masculine. Therefore, the masculine adjectival noun (صَغِير) is chosen.\nTechnically, the translation of this sentence is “The house is a small one.” However, because Arabic has only adjectival nouns and not adjectives, it is how we can express the English sentence “The house is small.” Therefore we can also translate it into English as such.\nNow let’s try a sentence with a feminine subject:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ صَغِيرَة.\nʾaljāriyatu ṣag͡hīrah\n“The girl is a little onef.” = “The girl is little.”\nIn the above example the subject (ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl”) was feminine. Therefore, we feminized the masculine adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr with the feminine marker ة to get the feminine adjectival noun صَغِيرَة ṣag͡hīrah “a little onef” and used the feminine adjectival noun in the sentence.\n\n\n7.7.2 Definite adjectival noun\nLet’s see if a definite adjectival noun can be used in the info. For example, we would like to say “The old tree is the big one.”\nThe subject of the sentence is ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmuiatu “the old tree”. And the info is ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ ʾalkabīratu “the big one”. When we put the two together we get:\nٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ\nʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmatu -lkabīratu\nThe problem is that the above could also be interpreted as one phrase “the big old tree”, and not as the complete sentence “The old tree is the big one.” This is the same problem that we highlighted in section @ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info).\nThe solution, too, is the same. We insert a detached pronoun, that matches the gender of the subject, between the subject and the info. So in order to get our intended meaning, we will say:\nٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ هِيَ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ.\nʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmatu hiya -lkabīratu.\n“The old tree is the big one.”",

Can we then use an adjectival noun by itself and not when it is describing another noun?\nThe answer is yes, we can. So for example, you can say:\nشَرِبَ ٱلصَّغِيرُ حَلِيبًا.\ns͡hariba -ṣṣag͡hīru ḥalībā.\n“The little one drank some milk.”\nThe above is a correct sentence. But, by itself, it is not very clear. What do we mean by “the little one”? Is it a little boy, or a little cat, or something else? So, context would be needed to know what exactly is being denoted by the adjectival noun when it is used by itself independently.\nHere is the same sentence again, but this time with some clarifying context.\nحَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ. وَشَرِبَ ٱلصَّغِيرُ حَلِيبًا.\nḥamalati -lʾummu -ṣṣag͡hīra. was͡hariba -ṣṣag͡hīru ḥalībā.\n“The mother carried the little one.

    "text": "7.9 Adjectival nouns re-used as common nouns\nSometimes, an adjectival noun, through much usage, acquires the meaning of a common noun. It then gets listed with this meaning in the dictionary. We actually just saw an example above. The adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a little one” is commonly used to mean “a baby”. Of course, context would be needed to know whether, in a particular sentence, it has its common noun meaning: “a baby”, or its general adjectival noun meaning: “a little one”.\nThe opposite of صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a little one” is كَبِير kabīr “a big one”. It too has acquired the common noun meaning of “an elder person”. Here is an example of its usage:\nقَدِمَ ٱلْكَبِيرُ وَوَعَظَ ٱلْغُلَامَ.\nqadima -lkabīru wawaɛaḍ͡ha -lg͡hulāma.\n“The elder arrived and admonished the boy.”\nWhen an adjectival noun gets re-used as a common noun, it loses its genderizability. For example, the feminine adjectival noun حَسَنَة ḥasanah (fem.) “a good one” is re-used as a common noun meaning “a good deed”. So we can use it in a sentence:\nٱلصِّيَامُ حَسَنَةٌ.\nʾaṣṣiyāmu ḥasanah.\n“Fasting is a good deed.”\nThe subject in this sentence is the masculine noun ٱَلصِّيَام ʾaṣṣiyām “fasting”. And the info is the feminine noun حَسَنَة ḥasanah “a good deed”. Note that the info does not match the subject in gender. This is because it lost its genderizability since it is no longer acting as an adjectival noun “a good onef”, but rather as the common noun “a good deed”.\nWhat if we have the sentence:\nٱَلصَّدَقَةُ حَسَنَةٌ.\nʾaṣṣadaqatu ḥasanah.\nThe feminine gender of the subject ٱَلصَّدَقَة. ʾaṣṣadaqah “charity” now matches the gender of the info حَسَنَة ḥasanah. So now, technically, the info could be the adjectival noun, meaning “a good onef”. So the sentence could mean:\n“Charity is good.”\nOr the info could be the common noun, meaning “a good deed”. Then the sentence would mean:\n“Charity is a good deed.”\nContext would be needed to tell us which meaning is intended.",

In this chapter we will learn about semi-flexible nouns.\nHere is an example of the kind of nouns we have learned so far:\nAs you can see, the noun is tanwīned when it is indefinite, and also, the vowel mark on the last letter changes for each state that the noun is in. These kinds of nouns are called fully-flexible nouns. They are by far the most common type of noun.\nThere are some nouns, however, that are semi-flexible. Here is an example of a semi-flexible noun, صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ “a desert”:\nAs you can see, when صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ is indefinite, it is not tanwīned. Also, when it is indefinite and in the i-state, the vowel mark on its final letter is not ◌ِ, as you might expect but ◌َ . And so the noun looks identical in the a-state and i-state when it is indefinite.\nWhen it is definite, however, it looks just like fully-flexible nouns.\nSo there are two differences between fully-flexible and semi-flexible nouns:\nThe other category of nouns are rigid nouns. Rigid nouns don’t change their endings due to their state. They are much fewer in number compared to flexible nouns. Pronouns are an example of rigid nouns.",

    "section": "8.2 Feminine markers",
    "text": "8.2 Feminine markers\nBefore we discuss semi-flexible nouns in more detail, we will discuss feminine markers. We already know of one feminine marker: the ة. When a singular noun ends with ة, then that is an indication, with very few exceptions, that it is a feminine noun. Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nFeminine noun\nMasculine noun from same root (if any)\n\n\n\n\nجري\nجَارِيَة “a girlf”\n–\n\n\nعلم\nعَالِمَة “a scholarf”\nعَالِم “a scholarm”\n\n\nكلب\nكَلْبَة “a dogf”\nكَلْب “a dogm”\n\n\nشجر\nشَجَرَة “a tree”\n–\n\n\nصغر\nصَغِيرَة adj. “smallf”\nصَغِير adj. “smallm”\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the feminine marker ة is never part of the noun’s root. It is thus considered extrinsic to the root. Also, sometimes, but not always, the feminine noun is formed by adding the feminine marker ة to the end of a masculine noun.\nIt is also important to note that ة is only a feminine marker for singular nouns. When we learn plurals, if Allāh wills, we will see that ة is used frequently with masculine plurals.\nNow we will learn of two more feminine markers: اء and ىٰ.\nHere are some examples of nouns that end with these two feminine markers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nFeminine noun\nMasculine noun (if any)\n\n\n\n\nصحر\nصَحْرَاء “a desert”\n–\n\n\nحمر\nحَمْرَاء adj. “redf”\nأَحْمَر adj. “redm”\n\n\nذكر\nذِكْرَىٰ “a remembrance”\n–\n\n\nغضب\nغَضْبَىٰ adj. “very angryf”\nغَضْبَان adj. “very angrym”\n\n\n\nWhen extrinsic to the word’s root, اء and ىٰ are feminine markers, just like ة. However, one important difference from ة is that sometimes اء and ىٰ may not be extrinsic to the word’s root. In this case, they will not be feminine markers, and the noun will regularly be a masculine noun. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nNoun\nPattern using paradigm فعل\n\n\n\n\nهدي\nٱلْهُدَىٰ (masc.) “the guidance”\nٱَلْفُعَل\n\n\nخبء\nخِبَاء (masc.) “a tent”\nفِعَال\n\n\n\nThese cases will become more clear, if Allāh wills, when we study weak roots (roots that contain a weak letter like ء، و، ي).\nOtherwise, when extrinsic to the word’s root, اء, and ىٰ are consistently feminine markers, just like ة.\nAlso, just like ة, اء and ىٰ are only feminine markers for singular nouns. We will see, if Allāh wills, that they are used frequently with masculine plurals.\nBy the way, another difference from ة is that when اء and ىٰ are feminine markers, and a masculine counterpart exists, then the feminine noun is not formed by simply adding the feminine marker to the end of the masculine noun. The masculine and feminine nouns are different internally as well. For example, the feminine noun حَمْرَاء adj. “redf” is not formed simply by adding the feminine marker اء to the end of the masculine noun أَحْمَر adj. “redm”.\nWe will discuss this in more detail below.",

    "section": "8.3 Categories of semi-flexible nouns",
    "text": "8.3 Categories of semi-flexible nouns\nWe now return to our discussion of semi-flexible nouns. Semi-flexible nouns, in terms of their formation, fall under different categories. We will discuss them below.\nWhen discussing semi-flexible nouns in isolation we will add the numeral 2 as a superscript to their ending, thus: 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2. This is to indicate their semi-flexibility. \n\n8.3.1 Nouns that end with an extrinsic اء\nIf a noun ends with an اء, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, then it shall be a semi-flexible noun.\nWe have already seen an example of such a noun above: 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”. The root of this noun is صحر. You can see that the ending اء is not part of the root. Therefore it is a semi-flexible noun.\nFurthermore, we have also learned that this اء, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, is a feminine marker for singular nouns, just like ة, except that ة does not generally make a noun semi-flexible.\nHere is an example sentence with this noun:\nذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ إِلَىٰ صَحْرَاءَ وَاسِعَةٍ.\nd͡hahaba -rrajulu ʾilā ṣaḥrāʾa wāsiɛah.\n“The man went to a wide desert.”\nNote that the vowel mark on the final letter of صَحْرَاءَ ṣaḥrāʾa is ◌َ, not ◌ٍ, even though it is indefinite and in the i-state (because it is preceded by the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to”). This is because it is a semi-flexible noun.\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 in this sentence is also a attributee, whose attribute is وَاسِعَةٍ wāsiɛatin “wide”. The final vowel mark ◌َ on the attributee صَحْرَاءَ ṣaḥrāʾa has no effect on the final vowel mark on the attribute وَاسِعَةٍ wāsiɛatin “wide”. All that matters in this regard is the state of the attributee.\nNote, also, that the attribute وَاسِعَة is feminine to match the gender of the attributee 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2.\nNote, as well, that the attribute وَاسِعَةٍ is tanwīned as it is indefinite and fully-flexible. The inability of its attributee 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 to be tanwīned (because of its semi-flexibility) does not affect the attribute.\nAlso, beware, as we’ve already mentioned, that there are some words where the اء ending may be part of the word’s root, for example خِبَاء k͡hibāʾ “a tent” from the root خبء on the pattern خِبَاء. Such words will be fully flexible.  Also, for the same reason, اء in this word is not a feminine marker, and the word is masculine.\n\n\n8.3.2 Nouns that end with an extrinsic ىٰ\nIf a noun ends with an ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root, then it shall be a semi-flexible noun.\nWe’ve already seen an example of such a word: 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”. The root of this word is ذكر and it is on the pattern فِعْلَىٰ.\nWe’ve also learned that, similar to اء, this ىٰ, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, is a feminine marker for singular nouns.\nSince 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 already ends with the vowel-mark ◌ٰ, the last letter won’t have any additional vowel markers and therefore the word will appear the same in all states:\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\na-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\ni-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\n\nTherefore, the state of such nouns cannot be determined by the vowel mark on their final letter, and has to be deduced otherwise by their function in the sentence. Nevertheless, these nouns are still included in the category of semi-flexible nouns, and not rigid nouns. This is because rigid nouns are closed set consisting only of pronouns and other similar words.\nHere is an example of this word in a sentence:\nٱَلْكِتَابُ ذِكْرَىٰ جَمِيلةٌ.\nʾalkitābu d͡hikrā jamīlah.\n“The book is a beautiful remembrance.”\nNote, again how the attribute جَمِيلَة jamīlah is feminine and in the u-state, in order to match the gender and state of the attributee 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2.\nBeware also that, just like in the case of اء, there are some words where ىٰ may be part of the word’s root, e.g. ٱَلْهُدَىٰ ʾalhudā “the guidance” whose root is هدي. Because here the ىٰ in ٱلْهُدَىٰ is part of the word’s root, therefore it shall not be a semi-flexible noun. So, when it is indefinite, it will be tanwīned: هُدًى hudan “a guidance”. Also, for the same reason, ىٰ in this word is not a feminine marker, and the word is masculine.\n\n\n8.3.3 Nouns on the pattern أَفْعَل\nIf a noun is on the pattern أَفْعَل ʾafɛal then it shall be a semi-flexible noun. By the way, there is no feminine marker on such words, so they will be masculine by default.\nMost colors and many physical characteristics fall into this pattern. Colors and physical characteristics are adjectival nouns. The masculine noun for such adjectival nouns is on the pattern أَفْعَل ʾafɛal. And the feminine adjectival noun is on the pattern فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ (which is itself a semi-flexible noun pattern because of the extrinsic اء ending). Here are some examples of such adjectival nouns:\n\n\n\nRoot\nMasc. Noun\nFem. noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nحمر\n2أَحْمَر\n2حَمْرَاء\nred\n\n\nسود\n2أَسْوَد\n2سَوْدَاء\nblack\n\n\nبيض\n2أَبْيَض\n2بَيْضَاء\nwhite\n\n\nعرج\n2أَعْرَج\n2عَرْجَاء\nlame\n\n\nحور\n2أَحْوَر\n2حَوْرَاء\nbeautiful eyed\n\n\nبكم\n2أَبْكَم\n2بَكْمَاء\nmute\n\n\n\nExample:\nلَبِسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ قَمِيصًا أَبْيَضَ.\nlabisa -rrajulu qamīṣan ʾabyaḍ.\n“The man wore a white shirt.”\n\n\n8.3.4 Adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان {Adjectival noun-an-diptote}\nThe letters ان may be an extrinsic ending for nouns. This ending is not a feminine marker so the noun would typically be masculine. This ending may cause the noun to be semi-flexible.\nThis category is more complicated than the previous ones. The following conditions must be satisfied for a word that ends with ان to be a semi-flexible noun:\n\nThe noun must be a adjectival noun on the pattern فَعْلَان. So the common noun ثُعْبَان t͡huɛbān “a serpent” of the root ثعي is a common noun and therefore, not a semi-flexible noun.\nThe ان must be extrinsic to the word’s root. So جَبَان jabānun “cowardly”, an adjectival noun of the root جبن, is not a semi-flexible noun.\nThe feminine of the adjectival noun shall not be formed by adding ة to the masculine noun. So نَدْمَان nadmān “regretful”, an adjectival noun from the root ندم, is not a semi-flexible noun, because its feminine is نَدْمَانَة nadmānah.\n\nIt is rare that this last condition fails. Most adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان are of the pattern فَعْلَان faɛlān and their feminine is of the pattern فَعْلَىٰ faɛlā (which is itself a semi-flexible noun pattern). These adjectival nouns typically have an emphatic meaning. The following are examples of semi-flexible adjectival nouns that fall into this category:\n\n\n\nRoot\nMasc. Noun\nFem. noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nغضب\n2غَضْبَان\n2غَضْبَىٰ\nvery angry\n\n\nعطش\n2عَطْشَان\n2عَطْشَىٰ\nvery thirsty\n\n\nجوع\n2جَوْعَان\n2جَوْعَىٰ\nvery hungry\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Nouns of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف\nNouns that are of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف are also semi-flexible nouns. Here each letter ف could be any letter of the alphabet.\nHere are some examples of these nouns:\n\n2مَسَاجِد masājid2 “mosques”\n2مَفَاتِيح mafātīḥ2 “keys”\n\nThese patterns are only used for plurals and we will study them in more detail in chapter @ref(broken-plurals) , if Allāh wills.",

    "section": "9.2 Forming the dual",
    "text": "9.2 Forming the dual\nThe dual is formed by appending the dual suffix ◌َانِ -āni when the noun is in the u-state and ◌َيْنِ -ayni when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. Definite nouns, which have ٱَلْ in their beginning are dualized the same way.\nFor example, when we dualize بَيْت bayt “a house” in order to say “houses2”, we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nبَيْتَانِ baytāni\nٱَلْبَيْتَانِ ʾalbaytāni\n\n\na-state and i-state\nبَيْتَيْنِ baytayni\nٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ ʾalbaytayni\n\n\n\nNote that indefinite duals are not tanwīned. The only difference between definite and indefinite duals is the definite article ٱَلْ “the”.\nHere are examples of duals in sentences:\n\nu-state:\nٱَلْكِتَابَانِ فِي ٱلْحَقِيبَةِ.\nʾalkitābāni fi -lḥaqībah.\n“The books2 are in the bag.”\na-state:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ كِتَابَيْنِ.\nqaraʾa -lg͡hulāmu kitābayn.\n“The boy read two books.”\ni-state:\nغَضِبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ عَلَى ٱلْجَارِيَتَيْنِ.\ng͡haḍibati -lʾummu ɛala -ljāriyatayn.\n“The mother became angry at the girls2.”  ### Nouns ending in ة\n\nIf a noun ends with a ة, then it is converted to a ت before appending the dual suffix. For example, dualizing شَجَرَة s͡hajarah “a tree”, we get “trees2”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nشَجَرَتَانِ s͡hajaratāni\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَانِ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratāni\n\n\na-state and i-state\nشَجَرَتَيْنِ s͡hajaratayni\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَيْنِ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratayni\n\n\n\nExample:\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَانِ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ.\nʾas͡hs͡haratāni fi -lḥadīqah.\n“The trees2 are in the garden.”\nIf a feminine noun does end with a ة then it will simply be appended with ◌َانِ -āni and ◌َيْنِ -ayni. For example, dualizing أُمّ ʾumm “a mother” in order to get “mothers2”, we get:\n\nu-state: أُمَّانِ ʾummāni\na-state and i-state: أُمَّيْنِ ʾummayni\n\nThere are some nouns that end with an alif before the ة, like فَتَاة fatāh “a young woman”. We will learn how to dualize these nouns later, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n9.2.1 Nouns ending with اء\nIf a noun ends with the feminine marker اء which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ء shall be replaced with a و when forming the dual. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nDual (u-state)\nDual (a-state and i-state)\n\n\n\n\nصحر\nصَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَانِ ṣaḥrāwāni\nصَحْرَاوَيْنِ ṣaḥrāwayni\n\n\nحمر\nحَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ “redf”\nحَمْرَاوَانِ ḥamrāwāni\nحَمْرَاوَيْنِ ḥamrāwayni\n\n\n\nThere are other words where the ء in the اء ending originates from the word’s root. Example:\n\nخبء خِبَاء (masc.) “a tent”, pattern: فِعَال\n\nWe will learn how to form duals of these words in later chapters, if Allāh wills. \n\n\n9.2.2 Nouns ending with ىٰ\nIf a noun ends with ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ىٰ shall be changed to a يَ when adding the dual suffixes. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nDual (u-state)\nDual (a-state and i-state)\n\n\n\n\nغضب\nغَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf”\nغَضْبَيَانِ g͡haḍbayāni\nغَضْبَيَيْنِ g͡haḍbayayni\n\n\nذكر\nذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَانِ d͡hikrayāni\nذِكْرَيَيْنِ d͡hikrayayni\n\n\n\nJust like in the case of اء, there are some words where ىٰ is not extrinsic to the word’s root. Example:\n\nهدي ٱلْهُدَىٰ (masc.) “the guidance”, pattern: ٱَلْفُعَل\n\nWe will learn how to form duals of these words in later chapters, if Allāh wills.",

Also, there is no attached pronoun for the dual speaker-participant. Again, the plural pronoun will be used in this case.\nThe dual absentee-participant detached and attached pronouns (“they2”/“them2”) are the same هُمَا -humā.\nJust like the absentee-participant singular masculine attached pronoun هُ hu “him”, the dual absentee-participant attached pronoun “them2” هُمَا -humā becomes هِمَا -himā when preceded by the vowels ◌ِ -i, ◌ِي -ī, or the semi-vowel ◌َيْ -ay. Examples:\n\nبِهِمَا bihimā “with them2”\nفِيهِمَا fīhimā “in them2”\nإِلَيْهِمَا ʾilayhimā “to them2”\n\nThe preposition لِ li “for” becomes لَ la when followed by the dual attached pronouns:\n\nلَهُمَا lahumā “for them2”\nلَكُمَا lakumā “for you2”\n\nAs expected, the long ā vowel at the ends of the dual attached pronouns becomes a short a vowel when followed by a connecting hamzah ٱ.

    "text": "9.7 Verbs with dual doers\n\n9.7.1 Dual nouns for the doer\nWe learned that the perfect verb for a masculine doer is on the pattern فَعَلَ. And when the doer is feminine, the ت of femininity is attached to the verb thus: فَعَلَتْ. We have used these verbs with singular doer nouns. The doer noun always comes after the verb and shall be in the u-state. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu.\n“The boy went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatun\n“A girl went.”\nThese same verbs are used when the doer noun is a dual. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامَانِ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmāni.\n“The boys2 went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatāni.\n“Two girls went.”\n\n\n9.7.2 Dual pronouns for the doer\nWe have already learned the singular doer pronouns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular participant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee\ninvisible\n“he”\nفَعَلَ faɛala\n\n\nFem. absentee\ninvisible\n“she”\nفَعَلَتْ faɛalat\n\n\nMasc. addressee\nتَ -ta\n“youm,2”\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\n\n\nFem. addressee\nتِ -ti\n“youf,2”\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\n\n\nSpeaker\nتُ -tu\n“I”\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\n\n\n\nNow we will learn the dual doer pronouns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDual participant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAbsentee\n◌َا -ā\n“them2”\nmasc.: فَعَلَا faɛalā, fem: فَعَلَتَا faɛalatā\n\n\nAddressee\nتُمَا -tumā\n“you2”\nفَعَلْتُمَا faɛaltumā\n\n\nSpeaker\n–\n“us2”\n–\n\n\n\nNote the following regarding the dual doer pronouns:\nThe dual doer pronouns are the same for both genders.\nHowever, when the absentee-participant doer pronoun (◌َا -ā) is used for a feminine doer, it is attached to the verb with an intervening ت of femininity thus: فَعَلَتَا faɛalatā “theyf,2 did” Here are some examples of the dual doer pronouns:\nسَأَلْتُمَانَا\nsaʾaltumānā\n“You2 asked us”\nسَأَلَتَاكُمَا\nsaʾalatākumā\n“Theyf,2 asked you2”\nسَأَلَاهُمَا\nsaʾalāhumā\n“Theym,2 asked them2”\n\n\n9.7.3 Sentence word order with dual doers\nAs we’ve mentioned, the doer, whether a noun or a pronoun, always comes after the verb. Here are a couple of examples of verbal sentences with dual doers:\nذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nd͡hahabā ʾilā baytin.\n“They2 went to a house.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلَانِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nd͡hahabā -rrujalāni ʾilā baytin.\n“The men2 went to a house.”\nThe above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a nounal sentence. This gives more emphasis to the subject. In this case, the verb shall follow the subject and will need a doer pronoun after it.\nٱَلرَّجُلَانِ ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nʾarrujalāni d͡hahabā ʾilā baytin.\n“The men2, they2 went to a house.”\n= “The men2 went to a house.”\nIf there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer in a verbal sentence, the doer noun will follow the first verb and the rest of the verbs will have doer pronouns. For example:\nأَكَلَ ٱلرَّجُلَانِ وَشَرِبَا وَذَهَبَا.\nʾakala -rrajulāni was͡haribā wad͡hahabā.\n“The men2 ate and they2 drank and they2 went.”\n= “The men2 ate and drank and went.”\nThe above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a nounal sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have doer pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the subject of the sentence.\nٱَلرَّجُلَانِ أَكَلَا وَشَرِبَا وَذَهَبَا.\nʾarrajulāni ʾakalā was͡haribā wad͡hahabā.\n“The men2, they2 ate and they2 drank and they2 went.”\n= “The men2 ate and drank and went.”",

One of these complications is that, in using plurals, Arabic distinguishes between intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings. Intelligent beings are those living beings that are endowed with reason like humans, angels, and jinn. Non-intelligent beings include animals, inanimate objects, abstract concepts, etc.\nAs a further complication, there is sometimes more than one way to use plurals.

For convenience, we will call it the “ūn sound plural” instead of the “-ūna/-īna plural”.\nHere is the ūn sound plural of مُعَلِّم muɛallim “a teacherm”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite ūn plural “teachersm”\nDefinite ūn plural “the teachersm”\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nمُعَلِّمُونَ muɛallimūna\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ʾalmuɛallimūna\n\n\na-state and i-state\nمُعَلِّمِينَ muɛallimīna\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ ʾalmuɛallimīna\n\n\n\nNote that, just like for duals, the indefinite ūn sound plural is not tanwīned. The only difference between the definite and indefinite ūn sound plural is the definite article ٱَلْ “the”.\nThe duals of مُعَلِّم muɛallim “a teacherm” are included here for comparison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite ūn sound plural “teachersm,2”\nDefinite ūn sound plural “the teachersm,2”\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nمُعَلِّمَانِ muɛallimāni\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَانِ ʾalmuɛallimāni\n\n\na-state and i-state\nمُعَلِّمَيْنِ muɛallimayni\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَيْنِ ʾalmuɛallimayni\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of the ūn sound plural in sentences:\n\nu-state:\nٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.\nʾalmuɛallimūna fi -lmadrasah\n“The teachers are in the school.”\na-state:\nسَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ مُعَلِّمِينَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾala -lg͡hulāmu muɛallimīna ɛan ʾamr.\n“The boy asked some teachers about a matter.”\ni-state:\nطَلَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ مِنَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمِينَ عِلْمًا.\nṭalaba -lg͡hulāmu mina -lmuɛallimīna ɛilmā.\n“The boy sought some knowledge from the teachers.”\n\n\n10.2.1 Applicability of the ūn sound plural\nExcept for very few exceptions, the ūn sound plural is used only for male intelligent beings.\n\n\nThe few exceptions of common nouns that denote non-male intelligent beings, yet have an ūn sound plural include:\n\nعَالَم ɛālam “a world” forms the ūn plural عَالَمُونَ ʾālamūna “worlds”.\nأَرْض ʾarḍ (fem.) “a land”, “an earth” forms the ūn plural أَرْضُونَ ʾarḍūna “lands”, “earths”.\nأَهْل ʾahl “a family” forms the ūn plural أَهْلُونَ ʾahlūna “families”.",

Also, just like for singular nouns, the final vowel on the plural ending ات āt indicates the state of the plural.\nThe āt sound plural does not take the fat·ḥah ◌َ and the tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً.

Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nصحر\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَات ṣaḥrāwāt\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Nouns ending with ىٰ\nConsistent with what we learned for duals in section @ref(duals-of-extrinsic-alif-maqsura), If a noun ends with ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ىٰ shall be changed to a يَ when when forming the āt sound plural. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nذكر\n2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَات d͡hikrayāt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Common nouns of the patterns فَعْل/فَعْلَة, فِعْل/فِعْلَة, and فُعْل/فُعْلَة\nCommon nouns of the patterns فَعْل/فَعْلَة, فِعْل/فِعْلَة, and فُعْل/فُعْلَة are treated specially when forming their āt sound plural.\nIf a common noun is of these patterns and the middle root letter is not و or ي, and the middle and final root letters are not the same, then the word is modified internally when forming the āt sound plural.\nThere are two separate rules to consider:\n\nIf a common noun is of the pattern فَعْل faɛl or فَعْلَة faɛlah, then the sukūn on the middle letter shall be converted to an fat·ḥah ◌َ when forming the āt sound plural. For example:\n\nنَحْلَة naḥlah “a bee” becomes نَحَلَات naḥalāt “bees”, not \\(\\times\\) نَحْلَات naḥlāt.\nضَرْبَة ḍarbah “a strike” becomes ضَرَبَات ḍarabāt “strikes”, not \\(\\times\\) ضَرْبَات ḍarbāt.\nصَفْحَة ṣafḥah “a page” becomes صَفَحَات ṣafaḥāt “pages”, not \\(\\times\\) صَفْحَات ṣafḥāt.\n\nIf the middle root letter is و or ي, or the middle and final root letters are the same then this modification is not done. For example,\n\nجَوْزَة jawzah “a walnut” becomes جَوْزَات jawzāt.\nحَجَّة ḥajjah “a pilgrimage” becomes حَجَّات ḥajjāt.\n\nIf a common noun is of the pattern فِعْل fiɛl, فِعْلَة fiɛlah, فُعْل fuɛl, or فُعْلَة fuɛlah then the sukūn on the middle letter can, optionally, either:\n\nbe retained,\nbe converted to an fat·ḥah, or\nbe converted to the vowel mark on the first letter.\n\nFor example:\n\nظُلْمَة ḍ͡hulmah “a darkness” can become, optionally, either ظُلْمَات ḍ͡hulmāt or ظُلَمَات ḍ͡hulamāt, or ظُلُمَات ḍ͡hulumāt “darknesses”.\nكِسْرَة kisrah “a piece” can become, optionally, either كِسْرَات kisrāt or كِسَرَات kisarāt, or كِسِرَات kisirāt “pieces”.\n\n\nNote that this rule of changing the vowel mark is only true for common nouns. Adjectival nouns on these patterns will retain the sukūn when forming the āt sound plural. So صَعْب ṣaɛb and صَعْبَة ṣaɛbah “a difficult one” become only صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt, not \\(\\times\\) صَعَبَات ṣaɛabāt.\n\n\n10.3.5 Applicability of the āt sound plural\nWe had mentioned that the ūn sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for male intelligent beings. Conversely, the āt is used for both female intelligent beings, and for non-intelligent beings (both masculine and feminine) like animals, inanimate objects, and abstract concepts. Rarely, it is also used for male intelligent beings.",

    "section": "10.4 Conditions for forming the sound plural",
    "text": "10.4 Conditions for forming the sound plural\nMany times, a noun can form both an ūn sound plural and an āt sound plural.  However, there are many nouns that can form only one of the two sound plurals. And many nouns don’t form either sound plural; they only form broken plurals. (We will learn about broken plurals in the next chapter, if Allāh wills.) There are even nouns that can form both sound and broken plurals.\nHere we will learn some of the conditions which a noun needs to satisfy in order for it to form the sound plurals.\n\n10.4.1 Conditions for the ūn sound plural\nThe ūn sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for nouns that denote male intelligent beings. These guidelines will help you determine which nouns form the ūn sound plural.\nWe will treat common nouns and adjectival nouns separately.\n\n10.4.1.1 Common nouns\n\nWith very few exceptions (some of which we saw in section @ref(applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural)), common nouns denoting male intelligent beings are disqualified from forming the ūn sound plural if their feminine counterpart is not formed by adding a ة to the masculine noun.  So, غُلَام g͡hulām “a boy” is disqualified from forming a ūn sound plural because its feminine counterpart is جَارِيَة jāriyah “a girl”, not \\(\\times\\) غُلَامَة g͡hulāmah.\nEven if a common noun denotes a male intelligent being and its female counterpart is formed by adding a ة, further conditions are imposed that can restrict its having a ūn sound plural. We will explain these restrictions below:\nWe learned in section @ref(related-nouns-for-male-and-female-animate-beings) that, in terms of their meaning, nouns that denote animate beings are of two kinds:\n\nNouns that have a primitive meaning. That is, their meaning is not derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding ة to the masculine noun):\n\n\n\nArabic word\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\na son\n\n\nطِفْل ṭifl\na child\n\n\nإِنْسَان ʾinsān\na human being\n\n\nحُرّ ḥurr\na free man\n\n\n\nSuch nouns, in general, won’t be expected to form ūn sound plurals, unless the ūn sound plural is explicitly allowed in their dictionary definition.\nNouns that have a meaning that is derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding ة to the masculine noun):\n\n\n\nWord\nDefinition\nūn plural\n\n\n\n\nمُعَلِّم\na teacherm\nمُعَلِّمُونَ\n\n\nمُسْلِم\na Muslimm (one who submits)\nمُسْلِمُونَ\n\n\nكَافِر\na disbelieverm\nكَافِرُونَ\n\n\nلَاعِب\na playerm\nلَاعِبُونَ\n\n\n\nSuch nouns, in general, can be expected to form ūn sound plurals.\n\n\nThe above defintion of primitve and derived nouns, as we have explained it, is somewhat imprecise. For example, the word حُرّ ḥurr (masc.) “a free man” seems to have a meaning that is derived from the adjective “free” and it forms its feminine by adding ة to it thus: حُرَّة ḥurrah (fem.) “a free woman”. Yet it is considered a primitve noun, and thus does not form an ūn sound plural.\n\nOnce you become more familiar with Arabic word patterns, distinguishing between primitive and derived nouns will become clearer, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n10.4.1.2 Adjectival nouns\nIf an adjectival noun forms its feminine by adding the feminine marker ة to the masculine noun, then we may assume that it forms the ūn sound plural.\nMost adjectival nouns satisfy this condition. For example, consider the adjectival noun:\n\nكَبِير kabīr (masc.) “a big one”\n\nIt forms its feminine by adding a ة to the masculine noun, thus:\n\nكَبِيرَة kabīrah (fem.) “a big one”\n\nThe above condition is satisfied; therefore, كَبِير kabīr (masc.) “a big one” forms the ūn sound plural كَبِيرُونَ kabīrūna “big ones”.\nBy the way, it is only the masculine adjectival noun that will form the ūn sound plural. Nouns with a ة are not allowed to form the ūn sound plural.\nWe have come across two patterns on adjectival nouns that don’t form their feminine by adding ة to masculine noun. These are:\n\n2فَعْلَان faɛlān2, whose feminine is on the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ faɛlā2. Example: 2غَضْبَان g͡haḍbān2 (masc.) “very angry” whose feminine is 2غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā2.\n2أَفْعَل ʾafɛal2, whose feminine is on the pattern 2فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ2. Example: 2أَحْمَر ʾaḥmar2 (masc.) “red”, whose feminine is 2حَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ2.\n\nBecause the above two patterns don’t form their feminine by adding ة to the masculine noun, therefore the masculine nouns don’t form the ūn sound plural. We will see in chapter @broken_plurals, if Allāh wills, that they form broken plurals instead.\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Conditions for the āt sound plural\nJust like the ūn plural, there are conditions that should be fulfilled in order for a noun to form an āt plural. We provide the following guidelines to help you determine if a noun can form an āt plural.\n\n10.4.2.1 Nouns that end with a feminine marker\nGenerally, all nouns that end with a feminine marker like ة, اء, and ىٰ are able to form an āt plural.  Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nحَسَنَة ḥasanah adj. “a good onef”\nحَسَنَات ḥasanāt\n\n\nحَسَنَة ḥasanah (common noun) “a good deed”\nحَسَنَات ḥasanāt\n\n\nصَدِيقَة ṣadīqah “a friendf”\nصَدِيقَات ṣadīqāt\n\n\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَات ṣaḥrāwāt\n\n\n2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَات d͡hikrayāt\n\n\n\nThe following are exceptions to this general rule, and don’t form āt sound plurals:\n\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَاء which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2أَفْعَل. For example, حَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ “redf”.\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2فَعْلَان. For example, غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf”.\nThe following exceptional nouns:\n\nأُمَّة ʾummah “a nation”\nأَمَة ʾamah “a female slave”\nشَفَة s͡hafah “a lip”\n\nThere are a few more such nouns, some of which we will introduce later.\n\nAll these exceptional nouns form broken plurals instead of the āt sound plural.\n\n\n10.4.2.2 Nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker\n\nCommon nouns\nCommon nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker will form the āt plural only if they don’t have a broken plural listed in the dictionary. Furthermore, it is preferred if the noun have five or more letters.\n\nحَيَوَان ḥayawān “an animal” forms the āt plural حَيَوَانَات ḥayawānāt “animals”.\nحَمَّام ḥammām forms the āt plural حَمَّامَات ḥammāmāt “bathrooms”. (The doubled م counts as two letters.)\n\n\n\nMasculine adjectival nouns\nMasculine adjectival nouns are permitted to form an āt sound plural, but only when they are applied to non-intelligent beings.\nFor example, if the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb “a difficult one” is applied to “books”, which is the plural of the masculine noun كِتَاب kitāb “a book”, then the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb is permitted to form the āt plural صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt “difficult ones”.\nBy the way, note that both the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb, and its feminine صَعْبَة ṣaɛbah form the same āt sound plural صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt.",

Examples:\n\nبِهِمْ bihimā “with them3,m”\nفِيهِنَّ fīhinna “in them3,f”\nإِلَيْهِمْ ʾilayhim “to them3,m”\n\nThe final sukūn on the مْ in the masculine plural pronouns (هُمْ hum, أَنْتُمْ ʾantum, and كُمْ -kum) becomes a ḍammah (هُمُ humu, أَنْتُمُ ʾantumu, andكُمُ -kumu respectively) when followed by a connecting hamzah. Examples:\n\nهُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.\nhumu -lmuɛallimūn.\n“Theypl. masc. are the (male) teachers.”\nذَهَبَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nd͡hahaba ʾilaykumu -rrajul.\n“The man went to you3,m.”\nأَنْتُمُ ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ.\nʾantumu -lmuslimūn. “You3,m are the Muslims3,m.”\n\nWhen the speaker plural attached pronoun نَا is attached to a word that ends with a نْ with a sukūn, there is only one ن written and it is doubled with a s͡haddah ◌ّ on it. So we get:\n\nنَا + مِنْ = مِنَّا minnā\nنَا + عَنْ = عَنَّا ɛannā\nنَا + لَدُنْ = لَدُنَّا ladunnā\n\nThe preposition لِ li “for” becomes لَ la when followed by the plural attached pronouns:\n\nلَهُمْ lahum “for them3,m”\nلَهُنَّ lahunna “for them3,f”\nلَكُمْ lakum “for you3,m”\nلَكُنَّ lakunna “for you3,f”\nلَنَا lanā “for us”\n\n\n\n10.6.1 Plural direct doee pronouns\nThe plural attached pronouns that we have just learned are also used as direct doee pronouns.  Examples:\nسَأَلَهُمُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nsaʾalahumu -rrajul.\n“The man asked them3,m.”\nسَأَلْتُكُمْ.\nsaʾaltukum\n“I asked you3,m.”\nسَأَلَتْكُنَّ.\nsaʾalatkunn.\n“She asked you3,f.”\nسَأَلَانَا.\nsaʾalānā.\n“They2,m asked us.”\nسَأَلَتَاهُ.\nsaʾalatāh.\n“They3,m asked him.”",

    "section": "10.7 Verbs with plural doers",
    "text": "10.7 Verbs with plural doers\n\n10.7.1 Plural nouns for the doer\nWe learned that the perfect verb for a masculine doer is on the pattern فَعَلَ. And when the doer is feminine, the ت of femininity is attached to the verb thus: فَعَلَتْ. We have used these verbs with singular and dual doer nouns. The doer noun always comes after the verb and shall be in the u-state. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu.\n“The boy went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatun\n“A girl went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامَانِ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmāni.\n“The boys2 went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatāni.\n“Two girls went.”\nThese same verbs are used when the doer noun is a plural. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.\nd͡hahaba -lmuɛallimūn.\n“The teacherm3,m went.”\nذَهَبَتْ مُعَلِّمَاتٌ.\nd͡hahabat muɛallimāt.\n“Teachers3,f went.”\n\n\n10.7.2 Plural pronouns for the doer\nWe have already learned the singular and dual doer pronouns. They are repeated here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAbsentee sing. masc.\ninvisible\n“he”\nفَعَلَ faɛala\n\n\nAbsentee sing. fem.\ninvisible\n“she”\nفَعَلَتْ faɛalat\n\n\nAbsentee dual\n◌َا -ā\n“them2”\nmasc.: فَعَلَا faɛalā, fem: فَعَلَتَا faɛalatā\n\n\nAddressee sing. masc.\nتَ -ta\n“youm,2”\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\n\n\nAddressee sing. fem.\nتِ -ti\n“youf,2”\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\n\n\nAddressee dual\nتُمَا -tumā\n“you2”\nفَعَلْتُمَا faɛaltumā\n\n\nSpeaker sing.\nتُ -tu\n“I”\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\n\n\nSpeaker dual\n–\n“us2”\n–\n\n\n\nNow we will learn the plural doer pronouns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplural participant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAbsentee pl. masc.\nو\n“they3,m”\nفَعَلُوا faɛalū\n\n\nAbsentee pl. fem.\nنَ -na\n“they3,f”\nفَعَلْنَ faɛalna\n\n\nAddressee pl. masc.\nتُمْ -tum\n“youm,3”\nفَعَلْتُمْ faɛaltum\n\n\nAddressee pl. fem.\nتُنَّ -tunna\n“youf,3”\nفَعَلْتُنَّ faɛaltunna\n\n\nSpeaker pl.\nنَا -nā\n“we”\nفَعَلْنَا faɛalnā\n\n\n\nNote the following regarding the plural doer pronouns:\n\nThe تْ of femininity does not attach to the absentee plural feminine doer pronoun نَ -na “they3,f” فَعَلْنَ. Example:\n\nذَهَبْنَ d͡hahabna “they3,f went”\n\nThis is different from the behavior of the absentee dual doer pronoun ◌َا -ā “them2,f” which, for a feminine doer, does attach to the تْ of femininity. Example:\n\nذَهَبَتَا d͡hahabatā “they2,f went”\n\nThe final sukūn on the مْ in the masculine plural doer pronoun تُمْ -tum becomes a ḍammah تُمُ -tumu when followed by a connecting hamzah. Examples:\n\nأَكَلْتُمْ خُبْزًا.\nʾakaltum k͡hubzā.\n“You3,m ate some bread.”\nأَكَلْتُمُ ٱلْخُبْزَ.\nʾakaltumu -lk͡hubz.\n“You3,m ate the bread.”\n\nThe absentee plural masculine verb doer pronoun “they3,m” و ū is written with a silent alif after it which is written only and not pronounced. This alif is dropped when a direct doee pronoun is attached. For example:\n\nضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.\nḍarabu -rrajul.\n“They3,m hit the man.\nضَرَبُوهُ.\nḍarabūh.\n“They3,m hit him.”\n\nThe plural masculine verb doer pronoun for the addressed person “you3,m” تُمْ -tum becomes تُمُو tumū when a direct doee pronoun is attached. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\nḍarabtumu -rrajul.\n“You3,m hit the man.”\nضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.\nḍarabtumūh.\n“Youpl. masc. hit him.”\n\nThe plural speaking participant doer pronoun نَا -nā is the same as the plural speaking participant attached pronoun نَا -nā. But you can tell them apart because the doer pronoun, when attached to the verb, causes the final letter of the verb to have a sukūn. Consider the following two sentences:\nسَأَلْنَا.\nsaʾalnā.\n“We asked.”\nسَأَلَنَا.\nsaʾalanā.\n“He asked us.”\n\n\n\n\n10.7.3 Sentence word order with plural doers\nAs we’ve mentioned, the doer, whether a noun or a pronoun, always comes after the verb. Here are a couple of examples of verbal sentences with plural doers:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nd͡hahaba -lmuɛallimūna ʾilā madrasah.\n“The teachers3,m went to a school.”\nذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nd͡hahabā ʾilā madrasah.\n“They3,m went to a school.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibati -ṣṣadīqātu fi -lbayt.\n“The friends3,f played in the house.”\nلَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibna fi -lbayt.\n“They3,f played in the house.”\nThe above verbal sentences with plural doers can be rearranged to be a nounal sentences. This gives more emphasis to the subject. In this case, the verb shall follow the subject and will need a doer pronoun after it.\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nʾalmuɛallimūna d͡hahabū ʾilā madrasah.\n“The teachers3,m, they3,m went to a school.” = “The teachers3,m went to a school.”\nٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ لَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nʾaṣṣadīqātu laɛibna fi -lbayt.\n“The friends3,f, they3,f played in the house.” = “The friends3,f played in the house.”\nIf there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer in a verbal sentence, the doer noun will follow the first verb and the rest of the verbs will have doer pronouns. For example:\nأَكَلَ ٱللَّاعِبُونَ وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.\nʾakala -llāɛibūna was͡haribū wad͡hahabū.\n“The players3,m ate and they3,m drank and they3,m went.”\n= “The players3,m ate and drank and went.”\nThe above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a nounal sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have doer pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the subject of the sentence.\nٱَللَّاعِبُونَ أَكَلُوا وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.\nʾallāɛibūna ʾakalū was͡haribū wad͡hahabū.\n“The players3,m, they3,m ate and they3,m drank and they3,m went.”\n= “The players3,m ate and drank and went.”\nSimilarly,\nأَكَلَتِ ٱللَّاعِبَاتُ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.\nʾakalati -llāɛibātu was͡haribna wad͡hahabn.\n“The players3,f ate and they3,f drank and they3,f went.”\nand\nٱَللَّاعِبَاتُ أَكَلْنَ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.\nʾallāɛibātu ʾakalna was͡haribna wad͡hahabn.\n“The players3,f, they3,f ate and they3,f drank and they3,f went.”\n= “The players3,f ate and drank and went.”\n\n\n\n10.7.4 Verbs with multiple doers mentioned individually\nIf there are multiple doers of a verb, and each is mentioned individually, then there is often more than one way to handle them. Here we will give the more common usage.\nIf the verb is followed by multiple doers, only the first is the true doer with respect to modifying the verb according to its gender and number. Examples:\nذَهَبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahabati -lʾummu wa-lg͡hulāmu.\n“The mother and the boy went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ وَٱلْأُمُّ .\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu wa -lʾummu.\n“The boy and the mother went.”\nIf the doers consist of different persons (speaking person, addressed person, and absent person), then they are placed in order of strength: The speaking person is stronger than the addressed person, who is stronger than the absent person. The verb doer pronoun of the first (true) doer is then used. Example:\nذَهَبْتُ أَنَا وَأَنْتَ وَهُوَ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾana waʾanta wahuwa.\n“I, you, and he went.”\nNote how the speaking person detached pronoun أَنَا ʾana is used in addition to the doer pronoun تُ -tu in order to add وَ wa “and” to it.\nIf the sentence is a nounal sentence, and the verb is in the info, then the doer pronoun corresponding to the number of the subject is used. Examples:\nأنْتَ وَهُوَ ذَهَبْتُمَا.\nʾanta wahuwa d͡hahabtumā.\n“You1,m and he, you2 went.”\nأَنَا وَمُحَمَّدٌ ذَهَبْنَا.\nʾana wamuḥammadun d͡hahabnā.\n“I and Muḥammad, we went.”\n\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ذَهَبَتَا.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatu d͡hahabatā.\n“The mother and the girl went.”\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ ذَهَبْنَ.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatāni d͡hahabna.\n“The mother and the two girls, they3,f went.”\nIf the doers consist of both male and female persons, then the verb will have the masculine doer prenoun corresponding to the number of the doers. Example:\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ وَٱلْغُلَامُ ذَهَبُوا.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatu wa-lg͡hulāmu d͡hahabū.\n“The mother, the girl, and the boy, they3,m went.”",

    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending “s” to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending “s”. Here are some examples,\nIn these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.\nArabic also forms such plurals. They are called broken plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or “broken-up” when forming the plural.\nWhile English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.",

    "section": "11.2 Review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns",
    "text": "11.2 Review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns\nBefore we begin our discussion about broken plurals, we will do a quick review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns. This will, if Allāh wills, facilitate the explanation of broken plurals.\nMost words in Arabic are formed from three letter roots. We use the paradigm root فعل to show word patterns. For example, the noun رَجُل rajul “a man” is formed from the root رجل on the pattern فَعُل faɛul.\nMost nouns in Arabic are fully-flexible. This means that, when indefinite, they are tanwīned and the indefinite i-state is shown by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ at the end of the noun. For example, رَجُل rajul “a man” and بَيْت bayt “a house” are fully-flexible nouns. So, you can see, below, that they are tanwīned, and the indefinite i-state is indicated by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ:\nذَهَبَ رَجُلٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nd͡hahaba rajulun ʾilā bayt.\n“A man went to a house.”\nSome nouns are semi-flexible. This means that they are not tanwīned, and also, the indefinite i-state is indicated by an fat·ḥah ◌َ. Examples of such nouns are:\n\n2غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā2 adj. (fem.) “a very angry onef” from the root غضب\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 (fem.) “a desertf” from the root صحر\n\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ غَضْبَىٰ إِلَىٰ صَحْرَاءَ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatun g͡haḍbā ʾilā ṣaḥrāʾ.\n“A very angry girl went to a desert.”\nWhen definite, semi-flexible nouns are identical to fully-flexible nouns:\nذَهَبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْغَضْبَىٰ إِلَى ٱلصَّحْرَاءِ.\nd͡hahabati -ljāriyatu -lg͡haḍbā ʾila -ṣṣaḥrāʾ.\n“The very angry girl went to the desert.”\nAll nouns that have the endings اء and ىٰ, that are extrinsic to the word’s root, are semi-flexible. اء and ىٰ are also feminine markers for singular nouns, just like ة. (Except that ة does not, in general, make a noun semi-flexible.)\nIt is important to note that ة, اء, and ىٰ are only feminine markers for singular nouns. We will see that they are also endings for broken plural nouns and, in that case, they are not feminine markers. However, اء and ىٰ, when endings for broken plural nouns, will make the broken plural nouns semi-flexible, just as they do for singular nouns.\nNouns that are of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف are also semi-flexible nouns. Here each letter ف could be any letter of the alphabet. These are patterns for broken plurals, as we will see very soon. We had mentioned this in section @ref(fafafif-diptote).\nThis concludes our short review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns. We will use these concepts in our discussion of broken plurals.",

    "text": "11.3 Patterns of the broken plural\nBroken plurals occur in specific patterns, which we will show using the paradigm فعل for three-letter roots. Ararbic also has (comparatively fewer) four-letter roots and we will show patterns for broken plurals of four-letter roots using the paradigm root فعلل. We will also use the letter ف, when needed, to indicate any letter of the alphabet.\nWe now give all but the rarest broken plural patterns below. \n\nفُعَل fuɛal.

We will expand on this in a subsequent section.\nSome patterns of the broken plural are also patterns singular nouns. For example, the pattern فِعَال fiɛāl has both singular nouns, like كِتَاب kitāb “a book” and broken plurals, like رِجَال rijāl “men”\nThe broken plural patterns فِعْلَان fiɛlān and فُعْلَان fuɛlān are fully-flexible nouns. Although they end with the ان ending which is extrinsic to the root, they are not semi-flexible nouns. Only singular adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان on the pattern فَعْلَان, and that also fulfil the other conitions listed in section @ref(adjectival noun-an-diptote), are semi-flexible.\nThere is often a correlation between the pattern of a singular noun and the pattern of its plural.\nSometimes this correlation is very strong:\n\nAll singular nouns of the patterns 2أَفْعَل ʾafɛal2 and 2فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ that denote colors and physical characteristics, have broken plurals on the pattern فُعْل fuɛl. Example:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\n2أَحْمَر, 2حَمْرَاء “red”\nحُمْر\n\n\n2أَبْكَم, 2بَكْمَاء “mute”\nبُكْم\n\n\n\nSingular nouns that have four or more consonant letters (excluding ة) regularly form their broken plurals on the patterns 2فَفَافِف and 2فَفَافِيف. The pattern 2فَفَافِيف is used when there is an intermendiate long vowel between the consonants. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nإِصْبَع “a finger”\n2أَصَابِع\n\n\nمِفْتَاح “a key”\n2مَفَاتِيح\n\n\n\nSingular nouns of the patterns فِعْلَة fiɛlah and فُعْلَة fuɛlah regularly form their broken plurals on the pattern فِعَل fiɛal and فُعَل fuɛal respectively. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nقِطْعَة “a piece”\nقِطَع\n\n\nرُكْبَة “a knee”\nرُكَب\n\n\n\n\nOther times, this correlation is more like a tendency:\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَعِيلَة faɛīlah tend to form broken plurals on the pattern 2فَعَائِل faɛāʾil2. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nحَدِيقَة “a garden”\n2حَدَائِق\n\n\nحَقِيبَة “a bag”\n2حَقَائِب\n\n\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَاعِل fāɛil, that denote male intelligent beings, tend to form broken plurals on the pattern فُعَّل fuɛɛal, فُعَّال fuɛɛāl, and فَعَلَة faɛalah. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nغَائِب “absent”\nغُيَّب\n\n\nقَارِئ “a readerm”\nقُرَّاء\n\n\nقَاتِل “a killerm”\nقَتَلَة\n\n\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَاعِل fāɛil and فَاعِلَة fāɛilah, that don’t denote male intelligent beings, tend to form broken plurals on the pattern فَوَاعِل fawāɛil. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nصَاحِبَة “a companionf”\n2صَوَاحِب\n\n\nعَامِل “a factor”\n2عَوَامِل\n\n\n\nفَارِس fāris “a horseman” with the plural 2فَوَارِس is one of a number of exceptions.\n\nSome words have roots that have the same letter repeated in the root. These are called doubled roots.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord\nPattern\n\n\n\n\nدبّ\nدُبّ “a bear”\nفُعْل\n\n\nحلّ\nمَحَلَّة “a locality”\nمَفْعَلَة\n\n\nأمّ\nإِمَام “a leader”\nفِعَال\n\n\nحقّ\nحَقّ “a truth, a right”\nفَعْل\n\n\nهرّ\nهِرّ “a catm”\nفِعْل\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss doubled roots in detail in chapter @ref(doubled-roots). For now we will mention the following:\n\nThe repeated letter in the word root may get doubled or separated in the word’s pattern. Frequently, the repeated letter may be doubled in the singular, and separated in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nحَقّ “a truth, a right”\nحُقُوق\n\n\nدُبّ “a bear”\nدِبَبَة\n\n\nهِرّ “a catm”\nهِرَرَة\n\n\n\nThe reverse also occurs, where the repeated letter may be separated in the singular, and doubled in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nإِمَام “a leaderm”\nأَئِمَّة\n\n\n\nThe doubled letter may modify the basic word pattern somewhat. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nشدّ\n2أَفْعِلَاء\n\\(\\times\\) 2أَشْدِدَاء\n2أَشِدَّاء\n\n\nحلّ\n2مَفَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) 2مَحَالِل\n2مَحَالّ\n\n\nصمّ\n2أَفْعَل\n\\(\\times\\) 2أَصْمَم\n2أَصَمّ\n\n\n\n\nWe have previously learned that the endings ة, اء, and ىٰ that are extrinsic to the word’s root are feminine markers for singular nouns. These extrinsic endings also occur for broken plurals but there, they are not feminine markers.\nIn fact, in a sort of role reversal, the endings ة in a broken plural tends to indicate that the singular is a masculine noun. And the اء ending is only for broken plurals of male intelligent beings. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nلِسَان “a tongue”\nأَلْسِنَة\n\n\nهِرّ “a catm”\nهِرَرَة\n\n\nأَمِير “a commanderm”\nأُمَرَاء\n\n\nصَدِيق “a friendm”\nأَصْدِقَاء\n\n\n\nThere often exist multiple broken plurals for the same singular noun. Many times, in fact, a singular noun may have a sound plural in addition to one or more broken plurals. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nشَهْر\nأَشْهُر, شُهُور\n\n\nعَيْن\nأَعْيُن, عُيُون, أَعْيَان\n\n\nعَامِل\nعَامِلُونَ, 2عَوَامِل, عَمَلَة, عُمَّال\n\n\n\nWe will discuss how to manage these multiple plurals in a subsequent section.\nOccasionally, multiple singular nouns will share the same broken plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nمَكْتَب “an office”\n2مَكَاتِب\n\n\nمَكْتَبَة “a library”\n2مَكَاتِب\n\n\n\nContext will then tell us which of two meanings is intended.\nThe letters ء, ا, و, and ي are considered weak letters. Words that one or more these weak letters in their roots are called defective words. We will discuss defective words more completely in later chapters, if Allāh wills. For now, we will note the following:\n\nWeak letters often get interchanged with one another when going from a singular to a plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأرخ\nتَأْرِيخ\n2تَوَارِيخ\n\n\nنوق\nنَاقَة\nنُوق\n\n\nثور\nثَوْر\nثِيرَان\n\n\n\nWeak letters can affect surrounding vowels. For example:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nبيض\nفُعْل\n\\(\\times\\) بُيْض\nبِيض\n\n\n\nThe weak letter ي, when followed by the ىٰ ending, usually modifies (in writing) it to an ِʾalif instead. The pronunciation is the same. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nهدي\n2فَعَالَىٰ\n\\(\\times\\) 2هَدَايَىٰ\n2هَدَايَا\n\n\n\nA ي at the end of a word, in some states, gets omitted and replaced by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ on the preceding letter. This happens even when the ي is extrinsic to the root, and even if the word is semi-flexible (and thus would not normally be tanwīned). Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nقضي\nفَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) قَاضِي\nقَاضٍ\n\n\nجري\n2فَوَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) 2جَوَارِي\n2جَوَارٍ\n\n\nليل\n2فَعَالِي\n\\(\\times\\) 2لَيَالِي\n2لَيَالٍ\n\n\n\nWeak letters can also get omitted in the singular and resurface in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأخو\nأَخ\nإِخْوَان, إِخْوَة\n\n\nأمو\nأَمَة\nإِمَاء\n\n\n\n\nIf there are more than four consonant letters in a word, then only four of them are selected to form the broken plural. For example:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nعَنْكَبُوت “a spider”\n2عَنَاكِب\n\n\n\nSome words have individual irrgularities as well and we will discuss them below:\n\nThe word ٱِمْرَأَة and its plural نِسَاء are both irregular and we will discuss them separately in chapter @ref(irregular-nouns).\nThe broken plural 2أَشْيَاء ʾas͡hyāʾ (of the singular noun شَيْء s͡hayʾ “a thing”) is irregular in that it is semi-flexible. Otherwise its pattern أَفْعَال ʾafɛāl is regularly fully-flexible.\nThe broken plural of the singular noun مَلَك malak “an angel” is مَلَائِكَة malāʾikah. It is on the pattern فَعَالِلَة faɛālilah. But it is unusual in that the plural has an extra letter ء that is missing in the singular. This is because the singular has a lesser-used variant: مَلْأَك malʾak that is used to form the plural.\nThe broken plural of the singular noun دِينَار “a dīnār” is 2دَنَانِير. It is on the pattern 2فَعَالِيل. It is irregular in that there are two ن’s in the plural whereas the singular only has one.\nThe root of بِئْر biʾr “a (water) well” is بأر. The pattern of its broken plural is أَفْعَال. Based on its root letters, its plural on this pattern ought regularly to have been أَبْآر ʾabʾār. And this plural exists but is not very commonly used. Instead, in forming the plural, the root letters ب and أ get swapped irregularly, and the more commonly used plural is actually آبَار ’ʾābār.\n\nThere are other words as well with similar irregularities.",

    "text": "11.4 Co-existence of multiple broken plurals\nWe noted that there are often multiple broken plurals for the same singular noun. Many singular nouns even have a sound plural in addition to one or more broken plurals. Here are some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nMeanings\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nجِدَار\na wall\nجُدُر, جُدْرَان\n\n\nشَهْر\na month\nأَشْهُر, شُهُور\n\n\nضَعِيف\na weak onem\nضِعَاف, 2ضُعَفَاء\n\n\nأَمْر\na matter; a command\nأُمُور, 2أَوَامِر\n\n\nعَيْن\nan eye; a (water) spring; an eminent person\nأَعْيُن, عُيُون, أَعْيَان\n\n\nعَامِل\na worker; a labourer; a factor\nعَامِلُونَ, 2عَوَامِل, عَمَلَة, عُمَّال\n\n\n\nWe will deal with the co-existence of sound and broken plurals in the next section. In this section, we will explain the existence of multiple broken plurals, and when one of them is preferred or required to be used over the other. Basically, there could be a few things going on:\n\nSometimes it is more or less optional which of the multiple broken plurals to use. For example, the singular noun جِدَار has two broken plurals: جُدُر, جُدْرَان Either could be used, more or less, interchangeably.\nSometimes, the usage of one of the plurals may be restricted. For example, ضِعَاف and ضُعَفَاء are both broken plurals of the masculine adjectival noun ضَعِيف “a weak onem”. For male intelligent beings, like “weak men”, either of the two plurals could be used. But remember that broken plurals that end with an extrinsic اء ending may only be used for male intelligent beings. So the plural ضُعَفَاء may only be used for male intelligent beings like “men” or “boys”, and not for masculine nouns that denote non-intelligent beings like “lions” or “pens”, etc.\nInterestingly, ضِعَاف is also shared as the broken plural for the feminine adjectival noun ضَعِيفَة “a weak onef”. So it can be used for plurals of feminine nouns, both for female intelligent beings like “women” and “girls”, and for feminie nouns that denote non-intelligent beings like “trees”.\nOther times, the singular has multiple distinct meanings, and each of these distinct meanings is associated with its own broken plural(s). Here are some examples:\n\nThe word أَمْر ʾamr has two distinct meanings, each with it’s own plural:\n\n“a matter”. This has the broken plural أُمُور ʾumūr.\n“a command”. This has the broken plural 2أَوَامِر ʾawāmir2.\n\nThe word عَيْن ʾayn has multiple distinct meanings. There are three main meanings, and they share the broken plural with each other in the following way:\n\n“an eye”. This meaning primarily uses the plural أَعْيُن ʾaɛyun but it may also use the plural عُيُون ɛuyūn, and rarely also the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n“a (water) spring”. This meaning primarily uses the plural عُيُون ɛuyūn but it may also use the plural أَعْيُن ʾaɛyun, and rarely also the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n“an eminent person”. This meaning only uses the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n\nThe word عَامِل ɛāmil has the following meanings and plurals:\n\n“a workerm”. Generally, this has the plural عُمَّال ɛummāl.\n“a labourerm”. This uses the plural عَمَلَة ɛamalah.\n“a factor”. This uses the plural 2عَوَامِل ɛawāmil2.\n\n\nArabic has what are known as plurals of fewness. These are specific patterns that may (sometimes, but not always) be used when the persons or things denoted by the plural are only a few (ten or less) and not many. These patterns are:\n\nفِعْلَة fiɛlah\nأَفْعُل ʾafɛul\nأَفْعَال ʾafɛāl\nأَفْعِلَة ʾafɛilah\n\nFor example:\n\nشَهْر s͡hahr “a month”, plurals: أَشْهُر, شُهُور. The plural أَشْهُر could be used when the number of months are only a few (ten or less), and the plural شُهُور could be used when the number of months are large.\nThe plurals أَعْيُن and عُيُون of the word عَيْن could also possibly be used similarly in this manner for both meanings: “an eye” and “a (water) spring”. (But not for the meaning “an eminent person” which only uses the plural أَعْيَان).\n\nOf course, this distinction only applies when the singular noun has additional plurals, not just one from the above four patterns. If a noun has only one of the about four plural patterns then it may be used indiscriminately and will not indicate any limitation in number.",

The sound plural is then, generally, reserved for certain verbal usages. (We will study these in later chapters, if Allāh wills.)\nSo, for example, قَتَلَة is preferred over قَاتِلُونَ generally for the meaning: “killers”.\n\n\n11.5.2 āt plurals and broken plurals\nāt plurals are used for both female intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings. We will discuss each of these separately.\n\n11.5.2.1 Female intelligent beings\nRemember from section @ref(conditions-for-the-at-plural) that, generally, all nouns that end with feminine markers (ة, اء, and ىٰ) can form the āt sound plural.\nThere are some nouns that are excepted from this statement. These nouns only have broken plurals and don’t form sound plurals. For female intelligent beings, these nouns are:\n\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَاء which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2أَفْعَل. For example, حور حَوْرَاء ḥawrāʾ “a beautiful eyed onef” uses the broken plural حُور ḥūr\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2فَعْلَان. For example, غضب غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf” uses the broken plural غِضَاب g͡hiḍāb.\nThe following exceptional nouns:\n\nٱِمْرَأَة “a woman”, broken plural: نِسَاء\nأَمَة “a slavef”, broken plural: إِمَاء\nأُمَّة “a nation”, broken plural: أُمَم\n\n\nIn the case of these nouns we have no choice but to use the broken plural.\nFor other nouns that denote female intelligent beings, the use of the āt sound plural is preferred over any broken plurals that the noun may have.\nSo, for example, the use of the āt sound plural صَغِيرَات is preferred over the broken plural صِغَار for the adjectival noun صَغِيرَة “a small onef”. However, both are permitted.\nThe following are excepted from this general statement:\n\nأُنْثَىٰ “a female”, plural: إِنَاث. The āt sound plural is almost unused for this word.\nBroken plurals of the patterns:\n\n2فَوَاعِل fawāɛil2\n2فَعَائِل faɛāʾil2\n\nThese broken plural patterns are, in fact, predominantly used for female intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings, and only rarely for male intelligent beings. So the broken plural 2جَوَارٍ “girls” may be used freely as the plural of جَارِيَة “a girl” and is not preferred over by جَارِيَات. Similarly, 2صَوَاحِب may freely be used as the plural of صَاحِبَة.\nOnly a few nouns denoting male intelligent beings have broken plurals on these patterns, like:\n\nفَارِس “a horseman”, plural: 2فَوَارِس\nخَلِيفَة “a successor”, plural: 2خَلَائِف\n\n\nIn conclusion, with the general preference of using the āt sound plural over the broken plural for female intelligent beings, you will find that نِسَاء nisāʾ “women” is the only widely found broken plural for female intelligent beings in normal usage.\n\n\n11.5.2.2 Non-intelligent beings\nFor non-intelligent beings, the broken plural is preferred for use over āt sound plurals.\nSo, for example, 2حَدَائِق ḥadāʾiq2 is preferred over حَدِيقَات ḥadīqāt as the plural of حَدِيقَة, though both are correct.",

    "section": "11.6 Usage of plurals",
    "text": "11.6 Usage of plurals\nThe treatment of plurals in sentences is quite complicated. Here we will give a simplified explanation that should suffice for basic usage, until we give a fuller treatment in (TODO: give chapter reference).\nWe will discuss the plurals of intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings separately.\n\n11.6.1 Plurals of intelligent beings in descriptive noun-phrases\nConsistent with what we have learned so far, when the attributee in a noun-phrase is plural, then the attribute comes after it, and matches it in state, definiteness, gender, and number.\nEither or both of the attribute and the attributee may be sound plurals or broken plurals.\nHere are some examples:\nلَعِبَ ٱلطِّفْلُ ٱلصَّغِيرُ مَعَ ٱلْغِلْمَانِ ٱلْكِبَارِ.\nlaɛiba -ṭṭiflu -ṣṣag͡hīru maɛa -lg͡hilmāni -lkibār.\n“The small child played with the big boys.”\nأَخَذَ ٱلتِّلْمِيذُ ٱلْعِلْمَ عَنِ ٱلْمُعَلِّمِينَ ٱلْكِرَامِ.\nʾak͡had͡ha -ttilmīd͡hu -lɛilma ɛani -lmuɛallimīna -lkirām.\n“The pupil took knowledge from the noble teachers.”\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ صَوَاحِبُ طَيِّبَاتٌ.\nliljāriyati ṣawāhibu ṭayyibāt.\n“The girl has good companionsf.”\nفِي ٱلسُّوقِ تُجَّارٌ صَادِقُونَ.\nfi -ssūqi tujjārun ṣadiqūn.\n“In the market are honest traders.”\nخَدَمَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلصَّالِحُ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْفُقَرَاءَ ٱلضِّعَافَ مِنَ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ ٱلصِّغَارِ.\nk͡hadama -rrajulu -ṣṣāliḥu -lg͡haniyyu -lfuqarāʾa -ḍḍiɛāfa mina -lyatāmā -ṣṣig͡hār.\n“The rich righteous man served the weak poor ones from the little orphans.”\n\n\n11.6.2 Plurals of intelligent beings in nounal sentences\nIf the subject of a sentence is a plural denoting intelligent beings then the info typically matches it in being a plural. This is especially the case if the info is an adjectival noun. For example:\nٱلْغِلْمَانُ أَطْفَالٌ طَيِّبُونَ.\nʾalg͡hilmānu ʾaṭfālun ṭayyibūn.\n“The boys are good children.”\nٱَلرِّجَالُ أَغْنِيَاءُ.\nʾarrijālu ʾag͡hniyāʾ.\n“The men are rich.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ عَالِمَاتٌ.\nʾalmuɛallimātu ɛālimāt,\n“The teachersf are scholarsf.”\nSometimes the info may not match the subject in plurality because of the meaning of the sentence. For example:\nٱَلْمُسْلِمُونَ أَمَّةٌ.\nʾalmuslimūna ʾummah.\n“The Muslims are a nation.”\nٱَلْجِيرَانُ ٱلطَّيِّبُونَ نِعْمَةٌ مِنَ ٱللَّـٰهِ.\nʾaljīrānu -ṭṭayyibūna niɛmatun mina -llāh.\n“Good neighbors are a blessing from Allah.”\n\nThe use of detached pronouns is consistent with what we learned in section @ref(detached-plural-pronouns). Examples:\nأَنْتُنَّ نِسَاءٌ كَرِيمَاتٌ.\nʾantunna nisāʾun karīmāt.\n“You3,f are generous women.”\nأَنْتُمْ شُبَّانٌ شُجْعَانٌ.\nʾantum s͡hubbānun s͡hujɛānun\n“Youm,3 are courageous young men.”\nٱَلشَّيَاطِينُ هُمُ ٱلْمَلَاعِنُ.\nʾas͡hs͡hayāṭīnu humu -lmalāɛīn.\n“The devils are the accursed ones.”\nهُنَّ نِسَاءٌ غَنِيَّاتٌ.\nhunna nisāʾun g͡haniyyāt.\n“They3,f are rich women.”\nنَحْنُ غِلْمَانٌ أَصْدِقَاءُ.\nnaḥnu g͡hilmānun ʾaṣdiqāʾ.\n“We are boys who are friends.”\n\n\n11.6.3 Plurals of intelligent beings with verbs\nWe have already studied verbs with sound plurals in section (ref). The same discussion applies to broken plurals as well. Here are a couple of examples:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلنِّسَاءُ وَكَتَبْنَ.\nqaraʾati -nnisāʾu wakatabn.\n“The women read and wrote.”\nٱَلْغِلْمَانُ لَعِبُوا بِكُرَةٍ حَمْرَاءَ.\nʾalg͡hilmānu laɛibū bikuratin ḥamrāʾ.\n“The boys, they played with a red ball.”\nطَبَخَتِ ٱلنِّسَاءُ طَعَامًا لِلرِّجَال فَأَكَلُوهُ وَشَكَرُوهُنَّ.\nṭabak͡hati -nnisāʾu ṭaɛāman lirrijāli faʾakalūhu was͡hakarūhunn.\n“The women prepared some food for the men, so they3,m ate it and they3,m thanked them3,f.\nظَلَمَ ٱلْجَبَابِرَةُ ٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَقَتَلُوهُمْ.\nḍ͡halama -ljabābiratu -lmasākīna waqatalūhum.\n“The tyrants wronged the needy ones3,m and killed them3,m.”\n\n\n11.6.4 Usage of plurals of non-intelligent beings\nWe now turn our attention to plurals of non-intelligent beings. The treatment of plurals of non-intelligent beings is very different from everything we have learned so far. In this basic, simplified, explanation: regardless of the grammatical or physical gender of the singular noun, plurals of non-intelligent beings are treated, for the purposes of matching adjectival nouns and pronouns, as grammatically feminine singular.\n\n\nSo, for example, the noun بَيت bayt denotes the inanimate object “a house”. It’s plural is بُيُوت. This plural is treated as a feminine singular noun. This is despite the fact that the singular noun بَيْت bayt “a house” is grammatically masculine. See how the بُيُوت buyūt is used in the examples below:\nٱَلْبُيُوتُ كَبِيرَةٌ.\n “The houses are big.”\nسَكَنُوا فِي بُيُوتٍ صَغِيرَةٍ.\n “They3,m lived in small houses.”\nسَقَطَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ.\n“The houses fell.”\nٱَلْبُيُوتُ سَقَطَتْ.\n “The houses, they fell.”\nهِيَ بُيُوتٌ لِلْفُقَرَاءِ.\n “They are houses for the poor.”\nPlurals of inanimate objects and animals (both male and female) are treated the same way. It doesn’t matter what the grammatical or physical gender of the singular is or whether it has a sound or broken plural. Examples:\nهِيَ ثِيرَانٌ وَحْشَةٌ.\n “They are wild bulls.”\nٱَلْهِرَرَةُ شَرِبَتِ ٱلْحَلِيبَ.\n “The catsm, they drank the milk.”\nٱَلْهِرَرُ شَرِبَتِ ٱلْحَلِيبَ.\n “The catsf, they drank the milk.”\nٱَلسُّفُنُ طَوِيلَة.\n “The ships are tall.”\nفِي ٱلصُّنْدُوقُ أَشْيَاءُ عَجِيبَةٌ.\n “In the box are wonderful things.”\n(Note how 2أَشْيَاء is indefinite but is not tanwīned. This is because it is irregularly semi-flexible.)\nBy the way, this rule only applies to adjectival nouns in the attributee or the info. A common noun in the attribute or info will continue match the attributee or subject in gender and number.\nFor example, if you say:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هِيَ ٱلْحَسَنَةُ.\n“The righteous acts are the good ones.”\nthen حَسَنَة may only be the feminine adjectival noun “a good one”.\nIf instead you want to use حَسَنَة with its common noun meaning of “a good deed”, then you have the use the plural:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هِيَ ٱلْحَسَنَاتُ.\n“The acts are the good deeds.”\nThe plural هِي may continue to be used instead of هُنَّ, although the latter is also valid:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هُنَّ ٱلْحَسَنَاتُ.\n“The acts are the good deeds.”\nSimilarly, if an adjectival noun connoting a non-intelligent being is used not as a attribute or an info in a sentence, then it should be pluralized to indicate plurality.\nٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ صَغِيرَةٌ وَكَبِيرَةٌ. ٱَلْكَبِيرَاتُ وَحْشَةٌ.\n“The animals are big and small. The big ones are wild.”\nIn the second sentence above, we could not have said (for the same meaning):\n\\(\\times\\) ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ صَغِيرَةٌ وَكَبِيرَةٌ. ٱَلْكَبِيرَةُ وَحْشَةٌ.\n\nIt is important to note that treating non-intelligent beings as grammatically feminine is only for the plural. Singular and dual nouns for non-intelligent beings are treated according to the gender of singular noun, as we have learned in previous chapters. So, for example,\nٱَلْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ.\n“The house is big.”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ٱَلْبَيْتُ كَبِيرَة.\nأَكَلَ ٱلْأَسَدَانِ ٱلظَّبْيَ.\n“The lions2 ate the gazelle.”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) أَكَلَتِ ٱلْأَسَدَانِ ٱلظَّبْيَ.",

    "text": "12.4 Definiteness of the annexation\nConsider again the annexation expression we have been using so far:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\n“the boy’s book”\nThe base noun ٱَلْغُلَام is definite because it is prefixed by ٱَلْ “the”. Therefore we have translated it as “the boy”. The annexe noun كِتَاب is not made definite by ٱَلْ. Nor is it made indefinite by tanwīn.  Rather, its definiteness is determined by the base noun. Because the base noun ٱَلْغُلَام is definite, therefore the annexe noun كِتَاب is also definite. The entire annexation is definite. \nConsider now the case when the base noun is indefinite.\nكِتَابُ غُلَامٍ\n“a boy’s book”\nIn the above example, the base noun غُلَامٍ is indefinite because it is tanwīned and because it does not prefixed by ٱَلْ. Therefore we have translated it as “a boy”. The annexe noun كِتَاب is neither tanwīned, nor does it have ٱَلْ. Its definiteness is, again, determined by the base noun. Because the base noun غُلَامٍ is indefinite, therefore the annexe noun كِتَاب is also indefinite. The entire annexation is indefinite.\nWe will see soon, if Allāh wills, why the definiteness of the annexe noun is important.\n\nHere are some examples of definite and indefinite annexations.\nلَبِسَ ٱلطِّفْلُ قَمِيصَ رَجُلٍ.\n“The child wore a man’s shirt.”\nأَخَذَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْجَيْشِ رَايَةَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَرَفَعَهَا.\n“The army’s commander took the king’s flag and raised it.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ.\n“The man sat in a tree’s shade.”\n\n12.4.1 Translating the annexation using “of”\nSo far we have been using the English “’s” to translate the Arabic annexation. Examples:\nبَيْتُ رَجُلٍ\n“a man’s house”\nبَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the man’s house”\nInstead of using “’s” we may use “of” as well. For example:\nبَيْتُ رَجُلٍ\n“a/the house of a man”\nبَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“a/the house of the man”\nNote that the annexe noun “house” may be prefixed with either “a” or “the”. This will depend on what is more natural in English. Often time both will fit. Here are some examples:\nلَبِسَ ٱلطِّفْلُ قَمِيصَ رَجُلٍ.\n“The child wore a/the shirt of a man.”\nأَخَذَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْجَيْشِ رَايَةَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَرَفَعَهَا.\n“The commander of the army took the flag of the king and raised it.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ.\n“The man sat in the shade of a tree.”\nفَتَحَ ٱللِّصُّ شُبَّاكَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَدَخَلَ ٱلْبَيْتَ.\n“The thief opened a/the window of the house and entered the house.”\nIt is important to understand that translating the annexe noun into English with “a” or “the” is purely for the reason of obtaining a natural translation. This does not affect whether or not the annexe noun is grammatically considered definite in Arabic.\nAs we mentioned earlier, the definiteness of the annexe noun in Arabic depends only on the definiteness of the base noun. If the base noun is definite then the annexe noun shall be considered definite as well. And if the base noun is indefinite then the annexe noun shall be considered indefinite as well.\nThe need to maintain this distinction will become apparent in the next section.\nIf the base noun is definite, and it is desired to make the annexe noun grammatically indefinite, then it is necassary to break the annexation, and use a prepositional phrase instead, usually with the preposition لِ, which, here, will mean “of”. Example:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ لِلرَّجُلِ.\n“The boy went to a house of the man.”\nفَتَحَ ٱللِّصُّ شُبَّاكًّا مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَدَخَلَ ٱلْبَيْتَ.\n“The thief opened a window of the house and entered the house.”",

    "section": "12.6 Attributes in an annexation",
    "text": "12.6 Attributes in an annexation\n\n12.6.1 Describing the base noun\nConsider the following expression:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ\n“the girl’s book”\nNow say that we want to form an descriptive noun-phrase “the small girl’s book”. Basically, we want to describe the base noun ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl” with the adjectival noun صَغِير “a small one”. Here is how we will express this in Arabic:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ ٱلصَّغِيرَةِ\n“the small girl’s book”\nIn the manner we are already familiar with, we place the attribute صَغِير “a small one” after the attributee ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl” and match the attribute with the attributee in definiteness, state, gender and number (singular, dual, or plural).\nSimilarly, if we had an indefinite annexation, we would get:\nكِتَابُ جَارِيَةٍِ صَغِيرَةٍ\n“a small girl’s book”\nHere are some more examples:\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ فِي حَدِيقَةِ ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The girl played in the garden of the big house.”\nقَرَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ سُورَةَ ٱلْقُرْآنِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ.\n“The boy read the sūrah of the Noble Qurʾān.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ عَرِيضَةٍ وَسِيعَةٍ.\n“The man sat in the shade of a wide broad tree.”\n\n\n12.6.2 Describing the annexe noun\nConsider, again, the same annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ\n“the girl’s book”\nSay, now, that we want to describe the annexe noun كِتَاب “book” with the adjectival noun صَغِير “a small one”. Normally, nothing can come between the annexe noun and the base noun in an annexation. So, the attribute needs to be placed, again, after the base noun. However, this time it will match the annexe noun, not the base noun, in state, definiteness, gender, and number. So we get:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ ٱلصَّغِيرُ\n“the girl’s small book”\nNote how the attribute ٱَلصَّغِيرُ matches the annexe noun كِتَابُ in state and gender. Note also how the attribute is definite with an ٱَلْ. This is because it is matching the annexe noun كِتَابُ in definiteness. The annexe noun كِتَاب is definite, not with ٱَلْ, but rather because of the definite base noun ٱَلْجَارِيَةِ “the girl”. We’ve already learned this rule in section @ref(definiteness-of-the-annexation) above.\nSimilarly, if we describe the annexe noun كِتَاب in an indefinite annexation, we get:\nكِتَابُ جَارِيَةٍ صَغِيرٌ\n“a girl’s small book”\nThis time the attribute صَغِيرٌ is indefinite with a tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ. This is because the annexe noun كِتَابُ is indefinite. It is indefinite because base noun جَارِيَةٍ “a girl” is indefinite.\nNow, you might be foreseeing a problem. What if the annexe noun and the base noun have the same gender, and the annexe noun too is in the i-state? For example, in the sentence:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The boy went to the big/old man’s house.”\nor\n“The boy went to the man’s big house.”\nHow do we know whether the attribute كَبِير is meant to describe the annexe noun بَيْتِ or the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل? The annexe noun بَيْتِ and the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل are both masculine, singular, definite, and in the i-state.\nThe answer is that in such cases, context will have to be clear to tell us which of the two meanings is intended. If the context makes it clear then there is no harm in using such a sentence for either of the two meanings. \nAlso, sometimes, the meaning of the attribute is such that it will likely apply to only one of the two nouns. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ.\n“The boy went to a noble/generous man’s house.”\nIn the sentence above the attribute كَرِيم “noble/generous” is likely to apply to a man, and not to a house.\nIf, however, the context is not clear, and the meaning of the attribute can apply to both the annexe noun and the base noun, then the attribute is likely to apply to the base noun and not to the annexe noun. So then, this interpretation is more likely:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The boy went to the big/old man’s house.”\nIn order to apply a attribute to the annexe noun in such a case, it is better to break the annexation and form a prepositional phrase instead, usually with the preposition لِ, which, here, will mean “of”. Example:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ لِلرَّجُلِ .\n“The boy went to the big house of the man.”\nHere are some more examples:\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ بِكُرَةِ ٱلْغُلَامِ ٱلْحَمرَاءِ.\n“The girl played with the boy’s red ball.”\n(Note that حَمْرَاء feminine to match كُرَة.)\nسَقَطَتْ وَرَقَةُ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ ٱلْخَضْرَاءُ عَلَىٰ مَاءِ ٱلنَّعْرِ ٱلْعَرِيضِ.\n“The green leaf of the tree fell on the water of the broad river.”\n(Note that خَضْرَاء is in the u-state to match وَرَقَة)\nحَمَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ حَقِيبَةَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ ٱلثَّقِيلَةَ.\n“The boy carried the heavy school-bag.”\n(literally: the heavy bag of the school).\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ عَلَىٰ صَفْحَةِ كِتَابٍ بَيْضَاءَ.\n“The man wrote on the white page of a book.”\n(Note that بَيْضَاءَ is feminine to match صَفْحَة. However, also note that it has an a-mark ◌َ in the i-state because it is semi-flexible.)",

    "text": "12.9 Pronouns as base nouns\nConsider the expression:\n“his book”\nThis expression is very similar to the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\n“the boy’s book”\nThe difference is that we would like to replace the base noun ٱَلْغُلَام “the boy” with the pronoun “his”. For this we use the attached pronoun هُ. When we place this pronoun as the base noun, we get:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nThis annexation follows the same rules as the other annexations we have been studying so far:\n\nThe annexe noun may be in any state, depending on its function in the sentence.\nThe base noun is in the i-state. But because the base noun is a pronoun, and pronouns are rigid nouns (see section @ref(rigidity-of-pronouns) that don’t change their ending based on their state, therefore it’s i-state will not be apparent.\n\nHere are some examples of this annexation used in sentences:\nكِتَابُهُ ثَقِيلٌ.\n“His book is heavy”\nقَرَأَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابَهُ.\n“The man read his book.”\nكَتَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ فِي كِتَابهِ.\n“The teacherm wrote in his book.”\nIf the annexe noun ends with ة then it is converted to a ت when annexing it to an attached pronoun. For example:\nذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَتِهِمْ.\n“They went to their school.”\nHere are some more examples of annexing to the different attached pronouns:\nدَخَلْتَ بَيْتَكَ.\n“You1,m entered your1,m house.”\nأَكَلَتَا طَعَامَهُمَا.\n“They2,f ate their2 food.”\nقَدِمْتُ إِلَىٰ مَدِينَتِكُمْ\n“I have arrived to your3,m city.”\nهُوَ إِمَامُ مَسْجِدِنَا.\n“He is the ʾImām of our mosque.”\nIf the annexe noun is semi-flexible then it gets a ◌ِ in the i-state, as we’ve already learned. Example with the semi-flexible broken plural 2حَدَائِق “gardens”.\nلَعِبْنَ فِي حَدَائِقِهِنَّ.\n“They3,f played in their3,f gardens.”\nIf an annexe noun ends with ىٰ then it gets converted to an alif when annexing it to an attached pronoun. Example with 2فَتَاوَىٰ “legal opinions”:\nكَتَبَ تَلَامِذَةُ ٱلشَّيْخِ فَتَاوَاهُ فِي كُتُبِهِمْ.\n“The pupils of the religious scholar wrote down his legal opinions in their books.”\nFor the singular speaker-participant there are two variants for the attached pronoun:\n\nي -ī\nيَ -ya\n\nThe first (ي -ī) is more commonly used. Example:\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابِي\n“I read my book.”\nأَقْلَامِي قَصِيرَة.\n“My pens are short.”\nIf, however, the annexe noun ends in a long vowel or a semi-vowel then (ي -ī) is disallowed and only (يَ -ya) shall be used. Example with the semi-flexible broken plural 2هَدَايَا “gifts”:\nأَعْجَبَتْهُمْ هَدَايَايَ.\n“My gifts pleased them.”\n\n12.9.1 Attributes with annexations to pronouns\nConsider the annexation:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nThe annexe noun is كِتَاب and the base noun is the pronoun ه. We would like add a attribute to this expression. Remember from section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns) that pronouns are definite nouns. That makes the annexe noun كِتَاب also definite. Therefore, any attribute for this annexation will need to be definite too.\nHere is a new rule: Pronouns may not be attributees. That is: they are not allowed to have attributes. Even in English you may say:\n“The good boy went.”\nbut you can’t say:\n\\(\\times\\) “The good he went.”\nSo, any attributes for the annexation must necessarily only describe the annexe noun, not the base pronoun. Example:\nكِتَابُهُ الأَحْمَرُ\n“his red book”\nHere are some more examples:\nكَتَبْتُ بِقَلَمِيَ ٱلْأَسْوَدِ\n“I wrote with my black pen.”\nحَمَلَ غِلْمَانُ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ حَقَائبَهُمُ ٱلثَّقِيلَة إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَتِهِمُ ٱلْبَعِيدَةِ.\n“The village boys carried their heavy bags to their distant school.”\n(literally: the village’s boys.)",

    "text": "12.10 Duals and ūn sound plurals in annexations\nWe have already dealt with broken plurals and āt sound plurals in annexations in section @ref(broken-plurals-and-at-sound-plurals-in-annexations).\nIn this section we will deal with duals and ūn sound plurals in annexations.\n\n12.10.1 Duals and ūn sound plurals as base nouns\nAs base noun, duals and ūn sound plurals behave no differently than other nouns. Being base nouns they will be in the i-state and this shall be indicated by:\n\n◌َيْنِ -ayni for duals\n◌ِينَ -īna for ūn sound plurals\n\nHere are some examples:\nلَجِئَ ٱلْمَظْلُومُنَ ٱلضُّعَفَاءُ فِي بِلَادِ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ ٱلْآمِنَةِ.\n“The weak wronged ones took refuge in the secure lands of the Muslims.”\nأُخُتُ ٱلْغُلَامَيْنِ ٱلطَّوِيلَيْنِ صَغِيرَةِ.\n“The tall boys’2 sister is little.”\nهِيَ طَالِبَةُ مُعَلِّمَتَيْنِ كَرِيمَتَيْنِ.\n“She is the studentf of noble teachers2,f.”\n\n\n12.10.2 Duals and ūn sound plurals as annexe nouns\nWhen duals and ūn sound plurals are annexe nouns, then their final ن is treated as a sort of tanwīn and is, therefore, deleted before annexing them to a base noun. For example:\nبَيْتَا ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the man’s houses2”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) بَيْتَانِ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nNote, also, that because the base noun ٱَلرَّجُلِ begins with a connecting hamzah ٱ, therefore the long vowel ā at the end of بَيْتَا is pronounced as a short vowel a, thus:\nbayta -rrajuli\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) baytā -rrajuli\nIf the dual annexe noun were in the i-state then the final ي gets an kasrah ◌ِ if there is following connecting hamzah. Example:\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيِ ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nqaraʾtu kitābayi -rrajul\n“I read the man’s books2.”\nHere are some more examples including ūn sound plurals:\nمُعَلِّمُو ٱلْغُلَامِ كِرَامٌ.\nmuɛallimu -lg͡hulāmi kirām.\n“The boy’s teachers3 are noble.”\n(Note that there is no silent alif after مُعَلِّمُو as there is after a verb with a plural absentee-participant doer pronoun, e.g. لَعِبُوا “they3,m played”)\nلَعِبَ ٱبْنَا ٱلرَّجُلِ مَعَ لَاعِبِي مَدِينَتِهِمْ.\nlaɛiba -bna -rrajuli maɛa lāɛibī madīnatihim.\n“The man’s sons2 played with the players of their city.”\n\n12.10.2.1 Annexing duals and ūn sound plurals to pronouns\nDuals and ūn sound plurals can be annexed to attached pronouns, and in this case too, they will lose their final ن. Examples:\nمُعَلِّمُونَا طَيِّبُونَ.\n“Our teachers3,m are good.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ مَعَ صَدِيقَتَيْهَا\n“The girl played with her friends2,f.”\nبَيْتَايَ كَبِيرَانِ.\n“My houses2 are big.”\n(Note that only the يَ variant is allowed to be used because of بَيْتَا ending with a long vowel.)\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيَّ\n(Note how كِتَابَيْ + يَ becomes كِتَابَيَّ.)\nThere are also two special cases in this category and we will examine them below:\n\nAnnexing an ūn sound plural to the singular speaker participant pronoun\nWhen an ūn sound plural is annexed to the singular speaker participant pronoun, then again, only the يَ variant can be used. However, in addition, the expression will appear the same regardless of the state of the annexe noun. So for all states (u-state, a-state, and i-state), we will get:\nمُعَلِّمِيَّ\nWe don’t say \\(\\times\\) مُعَلِّمُويَ for the u-state. Examples:\nمُعَلِّمِيَّ كِرَامٌ.\n“My teachers3,m are noble.”\n(u-state)\nسَأَلْتُ مُعَلِّمِيَّ\n“I asked my teachers3,m.”\n(a-state)\nأَخَذْتُ كِتَابًا مِنْ مُعَلِّمِيَّ\n“I took a book from my teachers3,m.”\n(i-state)\n\n\nAnnexing an dual noun to a dual pronoun\n\nWhen a dual noun is to be annexed to a dual pronoun, then the dual annexe noun is often converted to a plural. For example, instead of saying\nنَظَرْتُ إِلَىٰ رَأْسَيْهِمَا “I looked at their2 heads2.”\nit is in fact, more common, to say\nنَظَرْتُ إِلَىٰ رُؤُوسِهِمَا “I looked at their2 heads3.”\nAlthough the former is also correct. This is because the annexation of a dual to a dual is considered burdensome upon the tongue to utter, and so the plural is prefered.",

In this sentence there are two annexe nouns and one base noun.\nIn order to express this in Arabic, we will say:\nقَلَمُ ٱلْغُلَامِ وَكِتَابُهُ\nqalamu -lg͡hulāmi wakitābuhu\n“the boy’s pen and his book” = “the boy’s pen and book”\nNote that the annexation is not broken by the insertion of وَ wa “and”. Rather a second annexation is used and the two are separated by وَ wa “and”. This is the preferred way of expressing such expressions.\nThere is another, less preferred way of expressing this. And this is by breaking the first annexation and inserting وَ wa “and”:\nقَلَمُ وَكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\nqalamu wakitābu -lg͡hulāmi\n“the boy’s pen and book”\nThis second method is not considered as eloquent. Some even consider it incorrect. So we advise you to use the first method whenever possible.\n\n12.11.1.1 With pronouns\nIf the base noun in the first annexation is replaced with a pronoun then only the first method is allowed. For example,\nقَلَمُهُ وَكِتَابُهُ\nqalamuhu wakitābuhu\n“his pen and his book”\n\n\n\n12.11.2 One annexe noun and multiple base nouns\nWe can also have expressions like “the house of the boy and the girl”.

For example,\nبَيْتُ ٱلْغُلَامِ وَبَيْتُهَا\n“the boy’s house and her house”\nبَيْتُهُ وَبَيْتُهَا\nbaytuhu wabaytuhā\n“his house and her house”",

    "section": "12.13 Numbers from one to ten",
    "text": "12.13 Numbers from one to ten\nArabic numbers are complicated and we will treat them more fully in chapter (give ref), if Allāh wills. For now, we will give a short preview of the numbers from one to ten.\n\n12.13.1 The number one\nThe word for the number “one” is وَاحِد wāḥid. It is an adjectival noun and can be used as a attribute. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابًا وَاحِدًا.\n“I read one book.”\nAs usual, when the described noun is feminine, then the attribute too وَاحِد is feminized:\nأَكَلْتُ تَمْرَةً وَاحِدَةً.\n“I ate one date.”\nOften, as in English, using the number وَاحِد “one” is optional. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابً.\n“I read a book.”\n\n\n12.13.2 The number two\nThe number for “one” وَاحِد is a singular noun. Correspondingly, the number for “two” ٱثْنَانِ it͡hnāni is a dual noun. It too can be used as attribute. For example,\nدَخَلَ رَجْلَانِ ٱثْنَانِ.\ndak͡hala rajulāni -t͡hnān\n“Two men entered.”\nIn the the a-state and i-state, it becomes ٱثْنَيْنِ it͡hnayni. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ.\nqaraʾtu kitābayni -t͡hnayn\n“I read two books.”\nWhen feminized it becomes ٱثْنَتَانِ it͡hnatāni. For example,\nدَخَلَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ ٱثْنَتَانِ وَأَكَلَتَا تَمْرَتَيْنِ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ.\ndak͡hala jāriyatāni -t͡hnatāni waʾakalatā tamratayni -t͡hnatayn.\n“Two girls entered and ate two dates.”\nAs with وَاحِد “one”, the use of the number two is optional because its meaning is inherent in the dual. For example,\nدَخَلَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ وَأَكَلَتَا تَمْرَتَيْنِ.\ndak͡hala jāriyatāni waʾakalatā tamratayn.\n“Two girls entered and ate two dates.”\n\n\n12.13.3 The numbers from three to ten\nWe saw that the number وَاحِد “one” is a singular noun, and that the number ٱثْنَانِ it͡hnāni “two” is a dual noun.\nSo it should come as no surprise that the numbers three to ten are treated as plural nouns. (We say treated as plurals because they’re not technically plurals. For example, they don’t conform to the broken plural patterns. But let’s not worry about that for now.)\nNow, remember that ة is a feminine marker for singular nouns, but not for plural nouns. In fact, recall that there is almost a role reversal for ة in plural nouns, where it tends to occur for plurals of masculine nouns, and is missing for plurals of feminine nouns. For example, the plural of هِرّ “a male cat” is هِرَرَة, and the plural of هِرَّة “a female cat” is هِرَر, We will now see this role reversal of ة in the numbers three to ten. When a number from 3–10 is used for a masculine noun then it shall have ة and when it is used for a feminine noun then it shall not have ة. Here then are the numbers from 3–10:\n\n\n\nNumber\nMasculine\nFeminine\n\n\n\n\nthree\nثَلَاثَة\nثَلَاث\n\n\nfour\nأَرْبَعَة\nأَرْبَع\n\n\nfive\nخَمْسَة\nخَمْس\n\n\nsix\nسِتَّة\nسِتّ\n\n\nseven\nسَبْعَة\nسَبْع\n\n\neight\nثَمَانِيَة\nثَمَانِي\n\n\nnine\nتِسْعَة\nتِسْع\n\n\nten\nعَشَرَة\nعَشْر\n\n\n\nThe number 10 is irregular in that the masculine number has a fat·ḥah on the ش (عَشَرَة ɛas͡harah). Whereas the feminine number has a sukūn on the ش (عَشْر ɛas͡hr).\nConsistent with the numbers 1 and 2, the numbers from 3–10 may be used as attributes. But they are more often used as annexe nouns. As mentioned earlier, we will treat numbers more fully later, if Allāh wills. But here are some examples for now:\nلِلْمَرْأَةِ ثَلَاثَةُ أَبْنَاءٍ وَأَرْبَعُ بَنَاتٍ.\nlilmarʾati t͡halāt͡hatu ʾabnāʾin waʾarbaɛu banāt.\n“The woman has three sons and four daughters.”\nوَضَعْتُ عَشَرَةَ أَقْلَامٍ فِي عَشْرِ حَقِيبَاتٍ.\nwaḍaɛtu ɛas͡harata ʾaqlāmin fī ɛas͡hri ḥaqībāt.\n“I put ten pens in ten bags.”\nThe feminine number ثَمَانِي “eight” has a final weak letter ي. As we will learn in chapter (give ref), this final letter cannot take a kasrah or a ḍammah. For example,\nأَكَلَتْ ثَمَانِي هِرَرٍ ثَمَانِيَ كِسَرَاتٍ مِنَ ٱللَّحْمِ فِي ثَمَانِي سَاعَاتٍ.\nʾakalat t͡hamānī hirarin t͡hamāniya kisarātin mina -llaḥmi fī t͡hamānī sāɛāt.\n“Eight catsf ate eight pieces of meat in eight hours.”",

    "section": "13.2 The five nouns",
    "text": "13.2 The five nouns\nThere are five nouns in Arabic which are irregular in the same basic way. Collectively, they are called “the five nouns”. They behave a little differently from regular nouns in how they display their state. \n\n13.2.1 أَبٌ ʾab, أَخٌ ʾak͡h, and حَمٌ ḥam\nThe first three nouns that we will talk about are:\n\nأَب ʾab “a father” (root: أبو)\nأَخ ʾak͡h “a brother” (root: أخو)\nحَم ḥam “a father-in-law” (root: حمو)\n\nThe final root letter of all three of these nouns is و. However, irregularly, it is omitted in most formations of the word. It does resurface in some cases as we will describe below.\nWithout the final root letter و, these nouns display their state like regular nouns. Here are some examples:\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ أَبٌ كَبِيرٌ وَأَخٌ صَغِيرٌ.\nliljāriyati ʾabun kabīrun waʾak͡hun ṣag͡hīr\n“The girl has an old father and a young brother.”\nضَرَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ أَخًا لَهُ.\nḍaraba -lg͡hulāmu ʾak͡han lahu.\n“The boy beat a brother of his.”\nٱَلْحَمُ وَٱلْأَبُ فِي بَيْتِ ٱلْأَخِ.\nʾalḥamu walʾabu fī bayti -lʾak͡h.\n“The father-in-law and the father are in the brother’s house.”\nWhere the nouns behave irregularly is when they are an annexe noun in an annexation. Then instead of displaying their state with ◌ُ, ◌َ, and ◌ِ, they display their state using the long vowels و ū, ا ā, and ي ī instead. Here are some examples:\nهُوَ أَخُو ٱلْجَارِيَةِ.\nhuwa ʾak͡hu -ljāriyah\n“He is the girl’s brother.” \nسَأَلْتُ أَبَا صَدِيقِي عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾaltu ʾabā ṣadīqī ɛan ʾamr.\n“I asked my friend’s father about a matter.”\n\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ حَمِي ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ḥami -rrajul.\n“I went to the man’s father-in-law’s house.”\nWhen these nouns are annexed to attached pronouns, then in most cases they will behave as above. So, for example,\nأَبُوهُ\nʾabūhu\n“his father” (u-state).\nأَخَانَا\nʾak͡hānā\n“our brother” (a-state).\nHowever, if the attached pronoun is ي (for the singular speaker participant), then in that case, the attached pronoun ي attaches to the annexe noun directly, without any intervening long vowel:\n\nأَخِي\nʾak͡hī\n“my brother” (u-state, a-state, and i-state).\nأَبِي\nʾabī\n“my father” (u-state, a-state, and i-state).\nحَمِي\nḥamī\n“my father-in-law” (u-state, a-state, and i-state).\nHere are some more examples in sentences:\nأَخُوهُ طَوِيلٌ وَأَخُوهَا قَصِيرٌ وَأَخِي كَبِيرٌ.\nʾak͡hūhu ṭawīlun waʾak͡hūhā qaṣīrun waʾak͡hī kabīr.\n“His brother is tall and her brother is short and my brother is big.”\nسَأَلَ أَخَاهُمْ وَأَخَانَا.\nsaʾaltu ʾak͡hāhum waʾak͡hānā.\n“I asked theirm,3+ brother and our brother.”\nشَكَرَ أَخِي أَبِي.\ns͡hakara ʾak͡hī ʾabī.\n“My brother thanked my father.”\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَخِيهِنَّ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ʾak͡hīhinn.\n“I went to theirf,3+ brother’s house.”\nThe above irregular behavior of these three nouns is only when they are annexe nouns. When they happen to be base nouns in annexations, then they again they behave like regular nouns and their state is displayed by the short vowel marks ◌ُ, ◌َ, and ◌ِ, when definite, and by tanwīn ◌ٌ, ◌ً, and ◌ٍ, when indefinite. . Examples:\nبَيْتُ ٱلْأَخِ كَبِيرٌ.\nbaytu -lʾak͡hi kabīr.\n“The brother’s house is big.”\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَخٍ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ʾak͡h.\n“I went to a brother’s house.”\nWhen these nouns form their duals and plurals, then the final root letter و is resurfaces. In forming the broken plural, the final root letter و, being a weak letter, sometimes converts to a ء. The following table shows their duals and plurals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nDual (u-state)\nDual (a-state and i-state)\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأَب ʾab\nأَبَوَانِ ʾabawāni\nأَبَوَيْنِ ʾabawayni\nآبَاء ʾābāʾ\n\n\nأَخ ʾak͡h\nأَخَوَانِ ʾak͡hawāni\nأَخَوَيْنِ ʾak͡hawayni\nإِخْوَة ʾik͡hwah, إِخْوَان ʾik͡hwān\n\n\nحَم ḥam\nحَمَوَانِ ḥamawāni\nحَمَوَيْنِ ḥamawayni\nأَحْمَاء ʾaḥmāʾ\n\n\n\nOne special note regarding the dual أَبَوَانِ/أَبَوَيْنِ: in addition to meaning “two fathers”, they can also mean “both parents”, i.e., “a father and a mother”. Here are examples of these words in sentences:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْأَخَوَانِ إِلَى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\nd͡hahaba -lʾak͡hawāni fi -lmasjidi.\n“The brothers2 went to the mosque.”\nسَأَلْتُ أَخَوَيَّ عَنْ أَمْرٍ\nsaʾaltu ʾak͡hawayya ɛan ʾamrin.\n“I asked my brothers2 about a matter.”\nشَكَرْتُ لِأَبَوَيْهِ\ns͡hakartu liʾabawayhi.\n“I thanked his parents.”\n\n\n13.2.2 ذُو d͡hū and ذَات d͡hāt\nThe fourth irregular noun from “the five nouns” is the masculine noun ذُو d͡hū and its feminine counterpart ذَات and d͡hāt. The words ذُو d͡hū and ذَات d͡hāt mean “owner of” or “possessor of”.\nSo, for example, ذُو ٱلْمَالِ d͡hu -lmāli means “possessorm of wealth” or “wealthy personm”. The singular, dual, and plural of ذُو d͡hū in all three states is shown in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nSingular\nDual\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nذُو d͡hū\nذَوَا d͡hawā\nذَوُو d͡hawū\n\n\na-state\nذَا d͡hā\nذَوَيْ d͡haway\nذَوِي d͡hawī\n\n\ni-state\nذِي d͡hī\nsame as a-state\nsame as a-state\n\n\n\nThe noun ذُو d͡hū and its duals and plurals are only ever used as annexe nouns in annexations. Furthermore, they may not be annexed to pronouns. Here are some examples:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ ذُو ٱلْمَالِ.\nʾarrujulu d͡hu -lmāl.\n“The man is the possessor of wealth.” = “This man is wealthy.”\nThe word ذَات is the feminine of ذُو. When used as an annexe noun, its states, duals, and plurals are as in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nSingular\nDual\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nذَاتُ d͡hātu\nذَوَاتَا d͡hawātā\nذَوَاتُ d͡hawātu\n\n\na-state\nذَاتَ d͡hāta\nذَوَاتَيْ d͡hawātay\nذَوَاتِ d͡hawāti\n\n\ni-state\nذَاتِ d͡hāti\nsame as a-state\nsame as a-state\n\n\n\nExamples:\nهَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةُ ذَاتُ ثَمَرٍ كَثِيرٍ.\nhād͡hihi -s͡hs͡hajaratu d͡hātu t͡hamarin kat͡hīrin.\n“This tree is the possessor of much fruit.” = “This tree is very fruitful.”\nAs opposed to ذُو which is only an annexe noun, ذَات may be used a noun in its own right. In this case it means “personality” or “essence”. This usage is often found in theological or philosophical works. And, as such, unlike ذُو which can’t be annexed to attached pronouns, ذَات can be annexed to attached pronouns. Examples:\n\n\n13.2.3 فَم fam\nThe fifth of “the five nouns” is فَم fam “a mouth”. It is the most irregular of “the five nouns”.\nIn some ways, the word فَم fam is regular. It is only irregular when it is a singular annexe noun. Let’s first see its regular bahavior.\nعَلَى ٱلْوَجْهِ فَمٌ وَفِي ٱلْفَمِ لِسَانٌ.\nɛala -lwajhi famun wafi -lfami lisān\n“On the face is a mouth, and in the mounth is a tongue.”\nIt is a base noun in an annexation regularly:\nنَطَقَ لِسَانُ ٱلْفَمِ.\nnaṭaqa lisānu -lfam.\n“The mouth’s tongue articulated [speech].”\nIt forms duals regularly, which are used in annexations regularly\nفَمَا ٱلنَّهْرَيْنِ كَبِيرَانِ.\nfama -nnahrayni kabīrāni.\n“The mouths2 of the rivers2 are big.”\nLet’s now see its irregular behavior.\nWhen فَم is a singular annexe noun, then it is usual for it to follow the example of the rest of the five nouns.\n\nHere is how it will appear as a singular annexe noun in the three states:\n\n\n\nu-state\na-state\ni-state\n\n\n\n\nفُو fū\nفَا fā\nفِي fī\n\n\n\nExamples of usage:\nفُو ٱلنَّهْرِ كَبِيرٌ.\nfu -nnahri kabīr.\n“The mouth of the river is big.”\nفُوهَا جَمِيلٌ.\nfūhā jamīl.\n“Her mouth is beautiful.”\nفَتَحَ فَاهُ.\nfataḥa fāh.\n“He opened his mouth.”\nجَعَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لُقْمَةَ طَعَامٍ فِي فِي ٱبْنَتِهَا.\njaɛalati -lʾummu luqmata ṭaɛāmin fī fi -bnatihā.\n“The mother put a morsel of food in her daughter’s mouth.”\nWhen the attached pronoun for the speaking person ي is attached to فُو fū, فَا fā, or فِي fī the combination is always فِيَّ fiyya in all three states. Examples:\nفِيَّ مَفْتُوحٌ.\nfiyya maftūh.\n“My mouth is open.”\nفَتَحْتُ فِيَّ.\nfataḥtu fiyy.\n“I opened my mouth.”\nأَكَلْتُ بِفِيَّ.\nʾakaltu bifiyy.\n“I ate with my mouth.”\nIn addition to the above irregular behavior, it is permissible, but less common, to treat فَم regularly as an annexe noun in an annexation. So it is permissible to also say:\nفَمُ ٱلنَّهْرِ كَبِيرٌ.\nfamu -nnahri kabīr.\n“The river’s mouth is big.”\nفَمِي مَفْتُوحٌ.\nfamī maftūhun.\n“My mouth is open.”\nفَمُهَا جَمِيلٌ.\nfamuhā jamīlun.\n“Her mouth is beautiful.”\nفَتَحَ فَمَهُ.\nfataḥa famahu.\n“He opened his mouth.”\nجَعَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لُقْمَةَ طَعَامٍ فِي فَمِ ٱبْنَتِهَا.\njaɛalati -lʾummu luqmata ṭaɛāmin fī fami -bnatihā.\n“The mother put a morsel of food in her daughter’s mouth.”\n\nThe other irregularity of فَم fam “a mouth” is that its broken plural is أَفْواه ʾafwāh.\nNote that the letter م has not been used to form the broken plural, and instead a و, and a ه are used to form it.",

    "section": "13.3 Other irregular nouns",
    "text": "13.3 Other irregular nouns\nThere are more nouns that have irregularity in their own ways. We will discuss them below.\n\n13.3.1 أُولُو ʾulū and أُولَات ʾulāt\nأُولُو ʾulū (first syllable has a short vowel with a silent و) means “peoplem of”. It is only used as a masculine plural annexe noun, similar in meaning to ذَوُو d͡hawū which we discussed in section @ref(zu) above. There is no singular or dual of this noun.\nHere is its form in the different states:\n\n\n\nu-state\na-and i-state\n\n\n\n\nأُولُو ʾulū\nأُولِي ʾulī\n\n\n\nExample:\nلِأُولِي ٱلْأَرْحَامِ حُقُوقٌ.\nliʾuli -lʾarḥāmi ḥuqūq.\n“The people of the wombs (i.e. blood relatives) have rights.”\nThe feminine counterpart of أُولُو ʾulū is أُولَات ʾulāt “women of”. The first syllable again has a short vowel with a silent و.\n\n\n\nu-state\na-and i-state\n\n\n\n\nأُولَاتُ ʾulātu\nأُولَاتِ ʾulāti\n\n\n\nلِأُولَاتِ ٱلْحَمْلِ حُقُوقٌ عَلَىٰ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ.\nliʾulāti -lḥamli ḥuqūq ɛalā buɛūlatihinn.\n“The women of pregnancy (i.e. pregnant women) have rights upon their husbands.”\n\n\n13.3.2 أُمّ ʾumm\nThe noun أُمّ ʾumm “a mother” forms two āt sound plural variants:\n\nأُمَّهَات ʾummahāt\nأُمَّات ʾummāt\n\nThe first variant أُمَّهَات ʾummahāt is more commonly used. Example:\nأُمَّاهَاتُ ٱلْغِلْمَانِ طَيِّبَاتٌ.\nʾummahātu -lg͡hilmāni ṭayyibāt.\n“The boys’ mothers are good.”\n\n\n13.3.3 سَنَة sanah\nThe noun سَنَة sanah “a year” forms both an āt sound plural and an ūn sound plural. (Remember from section @ref(applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural) that a few nouns that don’t denote male intelligent beings have ūn sound plurals.)\nIn both plurals, the singular noun is modified irregularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nāt sound plural\nūn sound plural (u-state)\nūn sound plural (a-state and i-state)\n\n\n\n\nسَنَة sanah\nسَنَوَات sanawāt\nسِنُونَ sinūna\nسِنِينَ sinīna\n\n\n\nEither of the two plurals may be used interchangeably. Here are some examples:\n\n\n13.3.4 مَاء māʾ\nمَاء māʾ “a water” forms its broken plural irregularly: مِيَاه miyāh “waters”.\n\n\n13.3.5 شَفَة s͡hafah\nشَفَة s͡hafah “a lip” forms its broken plural irregularly: شِفَاه s͡hifāh “lips”.\nAlso, despite ending in the feminine marker ة, it does not form an āt sound plural.\n\n\n13.3.6 ٱِبْن ʾibn, ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah, and بِنْت bint\nThe noun ٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” is from the root بنو. It has two feminine counterparts:\n\nٱِبْنَة ʾibnah\nبِنْت bint\n\nwhich mean “a daughter”.\nٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” forms both a broken plural and an ūn sound plural.\nIts broken plural is أَبْنَاء ʾabnāʾ “sons”.\nIn forming the ūn sound plural, the singular noun is modified irregularly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nūn sound plural (u-state)\nūn sound plural (a-state and i-state)\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\nبَنُونَ banūna\nبَنِينَ banīna\n\n\n\nThe feminine ٱِبْنَة and بِنْت “a daughter” form the irregular āt sound plural بَنَات banāt “daughters”. Note that بَنَات banāt is not a broken plural from the root بنت. Therefore, it obeys the rules of āt sound plurals and does not end with ◌َ or ◌ً in the a-state.\nHere are some examples using these nouns:\n\n\n\n13.3.7 نَاس nās, and أُنَاس ʾunās\nنَاس nās and أُنَاس ʾunās are from the root أنس. They both mean “a people”.\nWhen indefinite, only أُنَاس ʾunās tends to be used, and نَاس nās tends to be unused.\nWhen definite, only ٱَلنَّاس ʾannās tends to be used, and ٱَلْأُنَاس ʾalʾunās is unused.\nHere are some examples using these nouns:\n\n\n13.3.8 The nouns ٱِمْرَأ and ٱِمْرَأَة\nThe nouns ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ (masc.) “a man, a person” and ٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah (fem.) “a woman” are quite irregular.\nFirstly, ٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah “a woman” is, from the perspective, of its meaning, the feminine counterpart of رَجُل rajul “a man (male human being)”.\nٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ, on the other hand, only means “a man” in a general sense. For example, in the sentence “A man is only as good as his word.” It can also be translated as “a person”.\nSecondly, ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ “a man, a person” has no plural. نَاس/أُنَاس “a people” and قَوْم “a population” may be used when a plural is required.\nٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah “a woman” irregularly forms the broken plurals نِسَاء nisāʾ and نِسْوَة niswah “women”. The former (نِسَاء nisāʾ) is more commonly used.\nLike شَفَة s͡hafah it also, despite ending in the feminine marker ة, does not form an āt sound plural.\nThirdly, both nouns are very irregular in how they become definite nouns with ٱَلْ. When ٱَلْ is prefixed to these nouns to make them definite, they lose the initial connecting hamzah and change their internal vowels. This table shows what we mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nDefinite of ٱِمْرَأ\nDefinite of ٱِمْرَأَة\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nٱَلْمَرْءُ ʾalmarʾu\nٱَلْمَرْأَةُ ʾalmarʾatu\n\n\na-state\nٱَلْمَرْءَ ʾalmarʾa\nٱَلْمَرْأَةَ ʾalmarʾata\n\n\ni-state\nٱَلْمَرْءِ ʾalmarʾi\nٱَلْمَرْأَةِ ʾalmarʾati\n\n\n\nThe masculine noun ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ has an additional irregularity. When it is indefinite, it irregularly displays its state, not only on its final letter ء, but also on the letter before it ر.\nIt is also permissible for it to behave regularly by displaying its state on its final letter only, but this is not as commonly used.\nThis table shows what we mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nRegular indefinite (less common)\nIrregular indefinite (more common)\n\n\n\n\nu-state\nٱِمْرَأٌ ʾimraʾun\nٱِمْرُؤٌ ʾimruʾun\n\n\na-state\nٱِمْرَءًا ʾimraʾan\nٱِمْرَءًا ʾimraʾan\n\n\ni-state\nٱِمْرَأٍ ʾimraʾin\nٱِمْرِئٍ ʾimriʾin\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of these nouns:",

    "section": "14.4 Flexibility of proper nouns",
    "text": "14.4 Flexibility of proper nouns\nIn this section we will discuss the flexibility of proper nouns. For now, we will deal only with proper nouns that do not begin with ٱَلْ. In terms of their flexibility, proper nouns consist of two types:\n\nFully-flexible proper nouns.\nSemi-flexible proper nouns.\n\nWe will treat each of them below.\n\n14.4.1 Fully-flexible proper nouns\n\nFor names that don’t begin with ٱَلْ, the default assumption is that they are fully-flexible, unless they fall into one of the categories of semi-flexible nouns (which we will study soon).\nExamples of fully-flexible names are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nمُحَمَّد\nMuḥammad\nمُعَاذ\nMuɛād͡h\n\n\nنُوح\nNūh\nسَعْد\nSaɛd\n\n\nشُعَيْب\nS͡huɛayb\nعَمَّار\nƐammār\n\n\nعَلِيّ\nƐalī\nحَسَّان\nḤassān\n\n\nزَيْد\nZayd\nسَعِيد\nSaɛīd\n\n\nأَنَس\nAnas\nأُحُد\nUḥud (a mountain)\n\n\n\nThese are all masculine names.\nExamples of sentences with fully-flexible proper nouns:\nزَيْدٌ غُلَامٌ طَيِّبٌّ.\nzaydun g͡hulāmun ṭayyib\n“Zayd is a good boy.”\nشَكَرَ أَنَسٌ عَلِيًّا.\ns͡hakara ʾanasun ɛaliyyā.\n“Anas thanked Ɛalī.”\nلَبِسَ سَعِيدٌ قَمِيصَ نُوحٍ ٱلأَخْضَرَ.\nlabisa saɛīdun qamīṣa nūḥini -lʾak͡hḍar.\n“Saɛīd wore Nūḥ’s green shirt.”\n\n\n14.4.2 Semi-flexible proper nouns\nThe rules for the semi-flexibility of proper nouns are a little different from the rules for the semi-flexibility of common nouns and adjectival nouns that we learned in chapter @ref(semi-flexible-nouns). Proper nouns shall be semi-flexible if they fall under one of the categories below. Note that the categories are not mutually exclusive. That is: some semi-flexible proper nouns will fall into more than one category.\n\n14.4.2.1 Names ending with ة\nAll names ending with ة shall be semi-flexible. This rule is specific to proper nouns. We have already seen that common nouns and adjectival nouns that end ith ة are fully-flexible.\nMost such proper nouns are feminine names. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2خَدِيجَة\nK͡hadījah\n2مَيْمُونَة\nMaymūnah\n\n\n2فَاطِمَة\nFaṭimah\n2صَفِيَّة\nṢafiyyah\n\n\n2عَائِشَة\nƐāʾis͡hah\n2خَوْلَة\nK͡hawlah\n\n\n2سُمَيَّة\nSumayyah\n2جَمِيلَة\nJamīlah\n\n\n2حَفْصَة\nḤafṣah\n2آسِيَة\nĀsiyah\n\n\n\nHowever, some masculine names may end with ة too:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2حَمْزَة\nḤamzah\n2مُعَاوِيَة\nMuɛāwiyah\n\n\n2أُسَامَة\nUsāmah\n2عِكْرِمَة\nƐikrimah\n\n\n2طَلْحَة\nṬalḥah\n2عُبَادَة\nƐubādah\n\n\n\nExample:\nطَلْحَةُ ٱلْطَّوِيلُ بَعْلُ جَمِيلَةَ ٱلْكَرِيمَةِ.\n“The tall Ṭalḥah is the husband of the generous Jamīlah.”\n\n\n14.4.2.2 Names ending with an extrinsic اء or ىٰ\nSimilar to common nouns and adjectival nouns, all names ending with an extrinsic اء or ىٰ shall be semi-flexible. These are usually feminine names. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2أَسْمَاء\nAsmāʾ\n2لَيْلَىٰ\nLaylā\n\n\n2دَرْدَاء\nDardāʾ\n2سَلْمَىٰ\nSalmā\n\n\n\nExamples in sentences:\nذَهَبَتْ سَلْمَىٰ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَسْمَاءَ.\n“Salmā went tp Asmāʾ’s house.”\nSentence word order is usually pretty flexible. For stylistic reasons, it is permissible for a direct doee to precede the doer. For example,\nسَأَلَتْ دَرْدَاءَ أَسْمَاءُ.\n“Asmāʾ asked Dardāʾ”\nBut because words that end with ىٰ never display any state, then for these words the sentence word order becomes more rigid. So the following sentence:\nسَأَلَتْ لَيْلَىٰ سَلْمَىٰ.\nwould usually only mean “Laylā asked Salmā.”\n\n\n14.4.2.3 Names ending with an extrinsic ان\nAll names ending with an extrinsic ان will be semi-flexible.\nThis is somewhat different from the rule we learnt for common noun and adjectival nouns in section @ref(adjectival noun-an-diptote). There only adjectival nouns of the pattern فَعْلَان and whose feminine was not formed by adding ة to it were considered semi-flexible nouns.\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2عُثْمَان\nƐut͡hmān\n2رَمَضَان\nRamaḍān\n\n\n2سُفْيَان\nSufyān\n2شَعْبَان\nS͡haɛbān\n\n\n\nExample:\nجَلَس عُثْمَانُ مَعَ سُفْيَانَ فِي رَمَضَانَ.\n“Ɛut͡hmān sat with Sufyān in Ramaḍān.”\n\n\n14.4.2.4 Names on the pattern أَفْعَل\nAll names on the pattern أَفْعَل shall be semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2أَحْمَد\nAḥmad\n2أَسْعَد\nAsɛad\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2.5 Names of the pattern فُعَل\nNames of the pattern فُعَل shall be semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n\n\n2عُمَر\nƐumar\n2مُضَر\nMuḍar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2.6 Names that are originally verbs\nNames that are originally verbs are semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n2يَزِيد Yazīd “He increases”\n2يَعِيش Yaɛīs͡h “He lives”\n\nTheir origin as verbs will be apparent when we study stateful verbs.\n\n\n14.4.2.7 Names of foreign origin\nNames of foreign origin are generally semi-flexible. These include the names of angels, many of the previous prophets and messengers, and other persons. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2جِبْرِيل\nJibrīl\n2زَكَرِيَّا\nZakariyyā\n\n\n2إِبْرَاهِيم\nIbrāhīm\n2يَحْيَىٰ\nYaḥyā\n\n\n2إِسْمَاعِيل\nIsmāɛīl\n2هَاجَر\nHājar\n\n\n2إِسْحَاق\nIs·ḥāq\n2مَرْيَم\nMaryam\n\n\n2يَعْقُوب\nYaɛqūb\n2يَأْجُوج\nYaʾjūj\n\n\n2يُوسُف\nYūsuf\n2مَأْجُوج\nMaʾjūj\n\n\n2يُونُس\nYūnus\n2إِبْلِيس\nIblīs\n\n\n2إِدْرِيس\nIdrīs\n2فِرْعَون\nPharoah\n\n\n2أَيُّوب\nAyyūb\n2هِرْقَل\nHeraclius\n\n\n2مُوسَىٰ\nMūsā\n2كِسْرَىٰ\nChosroes\n\n\n2عِيسَىٰ\nƐīsā\n2قَيْصَر\nCaesar\n\n\n\nNote that 2فِرْعَون “Pharoah” as 2قَيْصَر “Caesar”, despite being titles, are treated as proper names.\nThe only exception to this rule is a masculine name of foreign origin that comprises of only three letters, and whose middle letter has an sukūn. Such a name will be fully-flexible. Example:\n\nنُوح Nūḥ\n\n\n\n14.4.2.8 Feminine names\nAll feminine names, regardless of their origin, or their ending, shall be semi-flexible. We have already given examples of semi-flexible feminine names that end with ة, اء, and ىٰ, so we will provide other examples here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2زَيْنَب\nZaynab\n2مَرْيَم\nMaryam\n\n\n2سُعَاد\nSuɛād\n2هَاجَر\nHājar\n\n\n\nThe only exception to this rule is a feminine name of native Arabic origin, that comprises of only three letters, and whose middle letter has an sukūn. Such a name is permitted to be optionally fully-flexible or semi-flexible. Examples:\n\nهِنْد Hind\nدَعْد Daɛd\n\nExample of usage:\nذَهَبَتْ هِنْدٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ دَعْدٍ.\nor\nذَهَبَتْ هِنْدُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ دَعْدَ.\n“Hind went to Daɛd’s house.",

    "text": "14.7 The Replacement\nBefore we proceed with our discussion on proper nouns, we will take a short digression to discuss a grammatical concept called the replacement. We will only give a short preview here and will treat it fully in chapter @ref(the-replacement-chapter).\nA replacement is a word that follows another word, the replacee, and replaces it from the perspective of the grammar of the sentence. The replacement is put in the same state as the replacee. Here is an example of a sentence with a replacement and a replacee:\n\nIn the above sentence, the word كِتَابًا “a book” is the replacement of شَيْـًٔا “something”. Therefore, it is put in the same a-state.\nThe replacement is frequently used with proper nouns. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ عَمِّهِ عَلِيٍّ.\n“The boy went to his uncle Ɛalī’s house.”\nIn this sentence, the name عَلِيّ Ɛalī is the replacement of the replacee عَمّ “uncle”. Note, again, that the replacement comes after the replacee and matches it in state. However, the replacement does not need to come directly after the replacee. We can see that there is the pronoun ه “his” between them.\nHere is another example:\nسَأَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ مُعَاذٌ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَ سَعْدًا.\n“The student Muɛād͡h asked the teacher Saɛd.”",

    "section": "14.8 Annexed names",
    "text": "14.8 Annexed names\nSo far we have only dealt with proper nouns that are single words. There are some proper nouns that may be formed from two words that are in an annexation. These belong to different categories:\n\n14.8.1 “Slave of” names\nSome names are formed by annexing the noun عَبْد ɛabd “a slave” to one of the names of Allāh. The most common of these names are:\n\nعَبْد ٱللَّـٰه Ɛabd Allāh “the Slave of Allāh”\nعَبْد ٱلرَّحْمَـٰن Ɛabd al-Raḥmān “the Slave of the Most Merciful”\n\nAs usual, the base noun shall always be in the i-state. And the state of the annexe noun عَبْد is variable, depending on it’s function in the sentence. Example:\nعَبْدُ ٱللَّـٰهِ هُوَ أَخُو عَبْدِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ. “Ɛabd Allāh is the brother of Ɛabd al-Raḥmān.”\n\n\n14.8.2 “Parent of” names\nIt is common to call a man, not by his own given name, but rather by calling him the father of one of his children, usually his first born son. For example, if a man named أَحْمَد “Aḥmad” had a son named زَيْد “Zayd”, he may be called أَبُو زَيْد Abū Zayd “Zayd’s father”. Example of usage in a sentence:\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَبِي زَيْدٍ.\n“I went to Abū Zayd’s house.”\n(Note how زَيْدٍ has a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ in the i-state because it is fully-flexible.)\nWhile using the name of first-born son is more common, a daughter’s name could be used as well. Example,\nسَأَلْتُ أَبَا رُقَيَّةَ سُؤالًا.\n“I asked Abū Ruqayyah a question.”\n(Note how رُقَيَّةَ has an fat·ḥah ◌َ in the i-state because it is semi-flexible.)\nWomen, too, are similarly called as the mother of one of their children. For example, the wife of the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him) 2أُمّ حَبِيبَة Umm Ḥabībah was called thus because she had a daughter named 2حَبِيبَة from a previous marriage. \nBy the way, a person need not literally be a father or a mother to be called in such a way. These names may be applied as nicknames.\nFor example, the Companion of the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him) was called 2أَبُو هُرَيرَة Abū Hurayrah because it is reported that he used to have a pet kitten (هُرَيْرَة). Here is an example of this name in a sentence.\nأَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ صَحَابِيٌّ جَلِيلٌ.\n“Abū Hurayrah is a great Companion.”\n(Note how هُرَيْرَةَ is now considered a semi-flexible proper noun even though it may originally have been derived from the common noun “a kitten”.)\nSimilarly, the Companion أَبُو بَكْرٍ Abū Bakr is not known to have a son named بَكْر.\nIt is often the case that a “parent of” name overtakes the actual given name of person in popularity, and becomes the person’s name for all intents and purposes. Such is indeed the case for the Companions أَبُو بَكْرٍ Abū Bakr and 2أَبُو هُرَيرَة Abū Hurayrah.\n\n\n14.8.3 “Son of” names\nIn a manner similar to “parent of” names, a person may be referred to as the son of his parent. For example, the Companion 2عُمَر Ɛumar had a son named عَبْد ٱللَّـٰه Ɛabd Allāh. He is commonly known as 2ٱِبْن عُمَر Ibn Ɛumar “Ɛumar’s son”.\nAttributing a son to his father is most common. But attributing him to a mother or other ancestor is also possible.\nExamples:\n\nthe Companion عَمَّار was affectionately called 2ٱِبْن سُمَيَّة Ibn Sumayyah “Sumayyah’s son” by the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him). His mother Sumayyah was an early martyr in Islām.\nthe famous scholar ٱِبْن كَثِير Ibn Kat͡hīr is referred to by his grandfather’s name كَثِير Kat͡hīr.\na human being is called 2ٱِبْن آدَم based on his being a descendent of the first man, the Prophet Adam.\n\n\n14.8.3.1 Full names\nThe full name of a person is formed by putting his given name first, and then his “son of” name after it as a replacement. Here is an example of a full name:\nزَيْدُ بْنُ عَلِيٍّ\nZayd the son of Ɛalī\nNote some peculiarities of the full name:\n\nThe name زَيْد “Zayd” has lost its tanwīn.\nThe word بْن “son” is not written with its initial connecting hamzah ٱ.\n\nThese peculiarities are only when forming a full name in this manner. Consider for example the following sentence:\nزَيْدٌ ٱبْنُ عَلِيٍّ.\n“Zayd is the son of Ɛalī.”\nIn the above example, the name زَيْدٌ is tanwīned and ٱبْن is written with its connecting hamzah ٱ. Therefore this is not an expression of the full name in a replacee-replacement format. Rather, ٱبْنُ أَحْمَدَ here is the info of the sentence.\nFor women, the word بِنْت is used instead of بْن.\nExample:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ كِتَابَ ٱلطَّالِبَةِ زَيْنَبَ بِنْتِ أَحْمَدَ.\n“The teacher read the book of the student Zaynab the daughter of Aḥmad.”\nThe names of multiple forefathers may be strung together in this way separated by بْن. For example:\nٱِسْمُ نَبِيِّنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ ٱللَّـٰهِ بْنِ عَبْدِ ٱلْمُطَّلِبِ.\n“Our prophet’s name is Muḥammad the son of Ɛabd Allāh the son of Ɛabd al-Muṭṭalib.”\n(Note that the second بْنِ is in the i-state to match the state of the annexe noun عَبْدِ in عَبْدِ ٱللّـٰه.)\nWe will deal with complete full names in section @ref(complete-full-names) below.\n\n\n\n14.8.4 Other annexed names\nOther words besides عَبْد, أَب, أُمّ, and ٱِبْن may be used in annexed names too. Here are some examples:\n\nذُو ٱلْقَرْنَينِ D͡hu l-Qarnayn “He of the two horns”\nمَدِينَة ٱلنَّبِي madinatu -nnabiyyi “The City of the Prophet”, frequently reduced to simply ٱَلْمَدِينَة “al-Madīnah”.\nContext is used to infer whether by ٱَلْمَدِينَة is meant “al-Madīnah” or “the city”.\nٱمْرُؤُ ٱلْقَيْس Imruʾ al-Qays “The man of al-Qays”, a pre-Islāmic poet.",

Sometimes, this is systematic, as we will lear in section @ref(calling-names-with-al).

For example, 2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl is a name of the Prophet 2يَعْقُوب Yaɛqūb. The ūn sound plural بَنُونَ “sons/children” is annexed to the name 2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl to get the name of the tribe 2بَنُو إِسْرَائِيل Banū Isrāʾīl “the children of Isrāʾīl”. In the a-state and i-state, this becomes 2بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل Banī Isrāʾīl.\nNot all tribe names have بَنُونَ “sons” annexed to them, but many do. And often it is optional to keep or drop the annexed بَنُونَ. Examples:\n\nقُرَيْش Qurays͡h usually does not have بَنُونَ annexed to it.\nبَنُو تَمِيم Banū Tamīm may optionally drop the annexed بَنُونَ and be called simply تَمِيم Tamīm.\n\n\n14.11.1 Flexibility of tribe names\nThe flexibility of tribe names depends on the name. Here are some examples:\n\n2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl is a name of foreign origin and is therefore semi-flexible. Example:\nبَعَثَ ٱللَّـٰهُ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ.\n“Allāh sent Mūsā to the children of Isrāʾīl.”\nقُرَيْش Qurays͡h and تَمِيم Tamīm are native Arabic masculine names and are therefore fully-flexible. Example:\nقُرَيشٌ وَبَنُو تَمِيمٍ قَبِيلَتَانِ.\n“Qurays͡h and Banū Tamīm are tribes2.”\n2هَوَازِن Hawāzin is on the semi-flexible noun pattern 2فَفَافِف and is therefore semi-flexible.\n\n\n\n14.11.2 Gender of tribe names\nTribe names are unusual in that they are treated as both singular feminine and plural masculine. If the tribe name is the doer of a verb then it is usually treated as singular feminine. Otherwise, for example, if it comes before the verb, then the plural masculine pronouns are used for it.\nExample:\nسَكَنَتْ قُرَيْشٌ مَكَّةَ وَعَبَدُوا ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.\n“Qurays͡h dwelled in Makkah and they worshipped idols.”",

For example:\n\nMount Everest\nthe river Nile\nthe city of Damascus\n\nIn Arabic, the titles for these objects usually don’t occur as replacees as they do for persons. Rather, the title is annexed to the proper noun in an annexation. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nجَبَلُ أُحُدٍ\nMount Uḥud\nمَدِينَةُ دِمَشْقَ\nthe city of Damascus\n\n\nنَهْرُ ٱلنِّيلِ\nthe river Nile\nشَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ\nthe month of Ramaḍān\n\n\nيَوْمُ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ\nthe day of Friday\nسُورَةُ ٱلْفَاتِحَةِ\nthe Sūrah of al-Fātiḥah\n\n\n\nExample:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ سُورَةَ ٱلْفَاتِحَةِ فِي شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ.\n“The girl read the Sūrah of al-Fātiḥah in the month of Ramaḍān.”",

For example,\n\nقُرَيْش becomes قُرَشِيّ\n\nThe affiliate adjectival noun may be formed from any of the names of a person. (Usually, one of the more distinctive names is chosen.) For example:\n\nA follower of the school of thought of ٱَلْإِمَام أَبُو حَنِيفَة Imām Abū Ḥanīfah is called حَنَفِيّ “a Ḥanafī”.\nA follower of the school of thought of ٱَلْإِمَام أَحْمَد بْن حَنْبَل Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal is called حَنْبَلِيّ “a Ḥanbalī”.\n\n\nWe will treat adjectival nouns more fully in chapter @ref(the-affiliate-adjective-chapter).\nAfflilate adjectival nouns frequently occur with proper nouns. They come after the proper noun as a replacement, and are made definite by ٱَلْ to match the proper noun in definiteness. Examples:\nٱِبْن كَثِيرٍ ٱلدِّمَشْقِيُّ مُفَسِّرٌ وَمُؤَرِّخٌ.\n“Ibn Kat͡hīr the Damascan is an exegete and a historian.”",

    "section": "15.2 Calling out to specific persons",
    "text": "15.2 Calling out to specific persons\n\n15.2.1 Using single word personal names\nWhen a specific person is called out to, and the name used to call him consists of a single word, then that word shall be in the u-state. The sentence above is an example of this rule where the name زَينَبُ zaynabu “Zaynab” is in the u-state.\nIf the word would be tanwīned, then the tanwīn is dropped. So, for example, the name زَيْدٌ zaydun “Zayd” usually is tanwīned. But when used for being called out to, the tanwīn is dropped and it becomes:\nٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا زَيْدُ.\nʾassalāmu ɛalaykum yā zaydu.\n“Peace be upon you, O Zayd.”\n\n\n15.2.2 Using single word indefinite common nouns\nThe examples above show the person being called out to using a personal name. Instead of a personal name, a common noun can also be used with the same rule. Examples:\nٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا غُلَامُ.\nʾassalāmu ɛalaykum yā g͡hulāmu.\n“Peace be upon you, O you boy.”\nٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا جَارِيَةُ.\nʾassalāmu ɛalaykum yā jāriyatu.\n“Peace be upon you, O you girl.”\nIn English, we have shown that a specific person is being called using the word “you”, e.g., “O you boy”. Duals and plurals are also allowed, again with the same rule:\nيَا رِجَالُ، قَدْ حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ.\nyā rijālu qad ḥadat͡ha ʾamrun.\n“O you men, a matter has occurred.”\nNote how the word رِجَالُ rijālu “men” is not tanwīned because the word is used to call out to the specific persons.\nSimilarly,\nيَا لَاعِبَانِ بَدَأْتُمَا ٱللَّعِبَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُمَا ٱلْعَمَلَ.\nyā lāɛibāni badaʾtuma -llaɛiba wamā faɛaltuma -lɛamal.\n“O you players2, you have started playing and you have not done the work.”\n\n\n15.2.3 Using single word definite common nouns\nWhen using a common noun to call out to a person, especially if the common noun is a title, it is often desired to make the common noun definite with ٱَلْ. In this case, the particle يَا yā is modified to أَيُّهَا ʾayyuhā, or sometimes يَا أَيُّهَا yā ʾayyuhā. Examples:\nيَا أَيُّهَا ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ، قَدْ فَعَلْتُ ٱلْوَاجِبَ.\nyā ʾayyuha -lʾustād͡hu, qad faɛaltu -lwājiba\n“O you the Professor, I have done the obligatory [work].”\nأَنَا سَقِيمٌ أَيُّهَا ٱلطَّبِيبُ.\nʾana saqīmun, ʾayyuha -ṭṭabību.\n“I am ill, O you the Doctor.”\nIf the person being called out to is feminine, then أَيُّهَا ʾayyuhā is modified to أَيَّتُهَا ʾayyatuhā. For example:\nأَيَّتُهَا ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ، هَـٰذَا كِتَابِي.\nʾayyatuha -lmuɛallimatu, hād͡hā kitābi.\n“O you the teacherf, this is my book.”\n\n\n15.2.4 Using multiple words\nThe above discussion pertains to calling out to the addressed person with a single word. Often times a person’s name may consist of multiple words. For example:\n\nعَبْدُ ٱللَّـٰهِ\nɛabdu -llāhi\n“Ɛabd Allāh”\nأَبُو بَكْرٍ\nʾabū bakrin\n“Abū Bakr”\nصَلَاحُ ٱلدِّينِ\nṣalāḥu -ddīni\n“Salāḥ ad-Dīn”\n\nIn this case, then instead of the u-state, the word is put into the a-state. Furthermore, the tanwīn, if any, is preserved. Examples:\nمَا عَرَفْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ، يَا عَبْدَ ٱللَّـٰهِ.\nmā ɛaraftu d͡hālika -rrajula, yā ɛabda -llāhi.\n“I have not recognized that man, O Ɛabd Allāh.”\nيَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ، أَنْتَ رَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ.\nyā ʾabā bakrin, ʾanta rajulun karīmun\n“O Abū Bakr, You are a noble man.”\nيَا صَلَاحَ ٱلدِّينِ، صَبَرْتَ فَنَصَرَكَ ٱللَّـٰهُ.\nyā ṣalāḥa -ddīni, ṣabarta fanaṣaraka -llāhu.\n“O Salāḥ ad-Dīn, you were patient so Allāh gave you victory.”\nIf, instead of a personal name, a noun phrase consisting of multiple words is used to call out to a person, then in this case as well, the first noun shall be in the a-state. Examples:\nيَا أَمِيرَ ٱلْمُؤمِنِينَ، قَدْ حَضَرَ ٱلْقَوْمُ.\nyā ʾamīra -lmuʾminīna, qad ḥaḍara -lqawmu.\n“O Commander of the Believers, the people are present.”\nيَا ٱبْنَ أَخِي، قَدْ سَقَطَ قَلَمُكَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.\nya -bna ʾak͡hī, qad saqaṭa qalamuka.\n“O my nephew, your pen has fallen on the ground.”\nيَا تَلَامِيذَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ، ٱلْعِلْمُ أَمَانَةٌ.\nyā talāmīd͡ha -lmadrasati, -lɛilmu ʾamānatun.\n“O pupils of the school, knowledge is a trust.”\nWhen multiple words are used to call out to a person, the second word in the noun-chain may be a pronoun. Here too, the first noun shall be in the a-state. Examples:\nيَا أَبانا\nyā ʾabānā\n“O our father”",

    "text": "16.5 The pointing noun phrase\nRemember from chapter @ref(adjectival nouns-and-descriptive-noun-phrases) that a descriptive noun-phrase consists of a attribute and a attributee. The attribute follows the attribute and matches it in definiteness, state, gender, and number.\nHere is an example of a descriptive noun-phrase in a sentence.\n\nWe will now see how this same descriptive noun-phrase can be used with pointing nouns.\n\n16.5.1 Pointing to a single noun\nWe will first deal with nouns that are single words, like ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ above. In section @ref(pointing-to-an-annexation) below, we will deal with nouns that are part of an annexation, like كِتَابَيِ ٱلرَّجُلِ.\n\n16.5.1.1 The pointed-to noun noun is definite with ٱَلْ\nJust like an adjectival noun, a pointing noun can be a attribute in a noun-phrase. But remember from section @ref(definiteness-of-pointing nouns) above that pointing nouns are definite. So, if a pointing noun is a attribute in a noun-phrase, the attributee has to be definite too. Example:\n\nIn the above example, the pointed-to noun noun ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ is the attributee in a descriptive noun-phrase. It is definite, in the a-state, masculine, and dual.\nThe pointing noun هَـٰذَيْنِ is its attribute. It follows the attributee and matches it being dual, in the a-state, masculine, and dual.\nAs a special case, when the pointed-to noun noun has ٱَلْ (as in this case: ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ), then the order of the pointing noun and the pointed-to noun noun is permitted to be reversed. \nThe pointing noun is then a replacee (see section @ref(the-replacement)), and the pointed-to noun noun is its replacement.\nExample:\n\nIn the above example, the pointing noun هَـٰذَيْنِ is a replacee. It is definite, in the a-state, masculine, and dual.\nThe pointed-to noun noun ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ is its replacement. It follows the replacee and matches it being dual, in the a-state, masculine, and dual.\nAs a matter of fact, even though both orders are permitted, this reverse order of placing the pointing noun first and following it with the pointed-to noun noun is more common.\nHere are some more examples of pointing noun phrases when the pointed-to noun noun is definite with ٱَلْ:\nهَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ إِمَامٌ.\nٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ هَـٰذَا إِمَامٌ.\n“This noble man is an imām.”\n\n\n16.5.1.2 The pointed-to noun noun is a proper noun\nRemember that proper noun are definite nouns, even though they usually don’t begin with ٱَلْ. For example:\n\n\n\nزَيْد\nZayd\nٱَلْحَارِث\nal-Ḥārit͡h\n\n\n2زَيْنَب\nZaynab\nقُرَيْش\nQurays͡h\n\n\n\nSuch names may also be part of a pointing noun phrase. If they don’t begin with ٱَلْ then only the [pointed-to noun noun first, then pointing noun] order is permitted. Example:\nزَيْدٌ هَـٰذَا أَخُو زَيْنَبَ تِلْكَ.\n“This Zayd is that Zaynab’s brother.”\nقُرَيْشٌ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ سَكَنُوا بِمَكَّةَ.\n“These Qurays͡h dwelled in Makkah.”\nIf the name begins with ٱَلْ then both orders are permitted.\nهَـٰذَا ٱلْحَارِث\nٱلْحَارِث هَـٰذَا\n“this al-Ḥārit͡h”\n\n\n\n\n16.5.2 Pointing to an annexation\nConsider the following expression:\n“the man’s book”\nWe can apply the pointing noun “this” to either “the book” or to “the man” in a pointing noun phrase. So we have two options:\n\n“the book of this man”\n“this book of the man”\n\nSimilarly, consider the following expression:\n“Zayd’s book”\nWe can, again, apply the pointing noun “this” to either “the book” or to “Zayd”:\n\n“the book of this Zayd”\n“this book of Zayd”\n\nIn this section we will learn how to construct these pointing noun phrases in Arabic. Arabic uses annexations to express the above meanings. So we will discuss annexations like:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\nand\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ\n“the book of Zayd”\nNote that both the above annexations are definite because their base nouns are definite.\nIndefinite annexations like كِتَاب رَجُلٍ “a man’s book” cannot be used in pointing noun phrases.\n\n16.5.2.1 The definite base noun begins with ٱَلْ\nWe will first consider annexations where the definite base noun begins with ٱَلْ, like:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\n\n16.5.2.1.1 Pointing to the base noun\nWe would like to express the phrase:\n“the book of this man”\nIn order to point to the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل “the man” with the pointing noun هَـٰذَا “this-onem”, we can put the pointing noun either before or after the base noun, thus:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“the book of this man”\nBoth these pointing noun phrases give the same meaning: “the book of this man”. However, the first phrase كِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ is preferred, consistent with what we learned in section @ref(phrase-single-pointed-to-noun-with-al), above.\nThe second phrase كِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا, although correct, would only rarely be used with this meaning. (In fact, it has another meaning: “this book of the man” which we will learn in section @ref(pointing-to-the-annexe-noun), below.)\nHere is how these phrases could be used in complete sentences:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ جَدِيدٌ.\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا جَدِيدٌ.\n“The book of this man is new.”\nBefore we give more examples, let’s analyze these phrases in detail.\nConsider the first pointing noun phrase:\n\nAs you can see the pointing noun هَـٰذَا has taken the place of ٱَلرَّجُل as the base noun in the annexation. In addition to being the base noun, هَـٰذَا is also a replacee, whose replacement is ٱَلرَّجُل. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the book of this-one: the man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“the book of this man”\nConsider, now, the second pointing noun phrase:\n\nٱَلرَّجُل, here, keeps its place as the base noun in the annexation. In addition to being the base noun, ٱَلرَّجُل is also a attributee, whose attribute is the pointing noun هَـٰذَا. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the book of the this-one man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“the book of this man”\n\n\n16.5.2.1.2 Pointing to the annexe noun\nConsider, again, the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\nWe have already discussed how to point to the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل in a pointing noun phrase. Now, we would like to point to the annexe noun كِتَاب in a pointing noun phrase.\nIn other words, we would like to express the meaning:\n“this book of the man”\n\nThe way to express this in Arabic is\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the man”\nBut wait! Didn’t we see in section @ref(pointing-to-the-base-noun) above that this expression has the meaning “the book of this man”?\nIt turns out that this expression supports both meanings.\nBut it will generally only be used for the meaning: “this book of the man”\nIn order to express “the book of this man” we will typically use the expression كِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nLet’s analyze the expression كِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا “this book of the man” in detail:\n\nكِتَاب, here, is both and annexe noun and a attributee. Its attribute is the pointing noun هَـٰذَا. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the this-one book of the man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“this book of the man”\nHere is this pointing noun phrase in a complete sentence:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا أَخْضَر.\n“This book of the man is green.”\n\nAmbiguity of this phrase\nA quick note about the ambiguity of this expression:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the man” (usual)\n“the book of this man” (rare)\nThe ambiguity of whether the pointing noun هَـٰذَا points to the annexe noun كِتَابُ or the base noun ٱلرَّجُلِ only exists because the annexe noun and the base noun match each other in gender and number: singular masculine. If the annexe noun and the base noun were different in gender and number, then there would be no ambiguity. Examples:\nكِتَابَا ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَانِ\n“these books2 of the man”\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلَيْنِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the men2”\nكِتَابُ ٱلْمَرْأَةِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the woman”\nكِتَابُ ٱلْمَرْأَةِ هَـٰذِهِ\n“the book of this woman”\nHere are some more examples of pointing to annexe nouns:\n\n\n\n16.5.2.1.3 The base noun is a proper noun beginning with ٱَلْ\nConsider the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلزُّبَيْرِ\n“the book of al-Zubayr”\nWe can apply the preceding discussion of pointing to the annexe noun and base noun to this annexation as well. So we get:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلزُّبَيْرِ\n“the book of this al-Zubayr”\nكِتَابُ ٱلزُّبَيْرِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of al-Zubayr” (usual)\n“the book of this al-Zubayr” (rare)\n\n\n\n16.5.2.2 The definite base noun does not begin with ٱَلْ\nConsider, now, that the base noun is definite but does not begin with ٱَلْ. There are two such types of nouns that we will discuss:\n\nProper nouns not beginning with ٱَلْ\nPronouns\n\n\n16.5.2.2.1 The base noun is a proper noun not beginning with ٱَلْ\n\nWe will first deal with proper nouns that don’t begin with ٱَلْ. Consider the annexation:\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ\n“the book of Zayd”\nBecause the base noun زَيْد does not begin with ٱَلْ, any pointing nouns can come only after the entire annexation, thus:\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ هَـٰذَا\nIn theory, this supports two meanings:\n\n“this book of Zayd”\n“the book of this Zayd”\n\nIn practice, however, the first meaning (“this book of Zayd”) is much more likely. Pointing to a proper noun in a pointing noun phrase (“the book of this Zayd”) is uncommon, generally.\n\n\n16.5.2.2.2 The base noun is a pronoun\nWe have learned, in section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns), that pronouns are always definite, despite not beginning with ٱَلْ.\nWe have also learned, in section @ref(pronouns-as-base-nouns), that a pronoun may be a base noun in an annexation. Example:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nNeither the annexe noun كِتَاب, nor the attached pronoun هُ begin with ٱَلْ. So if we want to add the pointing noun هَـٰذَا to this annexation to form a pointing noun phrase, then we have to place it at the end, after the annexation, thus:\nكِتَابُهُ هَـٰذَا\nThe pointing noun هَـٰذَا, here, is a attributee. But what is its attribute?\nWe have also learned, in section @ref(attributes-with-annexations-to-pronouns) that pronouns may not be attributees in a descriptive noun phrase.\nSo, we are left with only one option: the annexe noun كِتَاب is the desceibee. And the meaning of the phrase is:\nكِتَابُهُ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of his”\n\nHere are some more examples:",

    "section": "16.6 Pointing nouns as subjects",
    "text": "16.6 Pointing nouns as subjects\nBesides their use in pointing noun phrases, pointing nouns are very often used as the subject of a sentence. For example:\n\nThe pointing noun is (usually) made to match the info in number and gender. Examples:\nهَاتَانِ جَارِيَتَانِ.\n“These are girls2.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ مُعَلِّمُونَ.\n“Those are teachers.”\nهَـٰؤُلَاءِ أَقْلَامٌ.\n“These are pens.”\nتِلْكَ بُيُوتٌ.\n“Those are houses.”\nهَـٰذَانِ صَغِيرَانِ.\n“These are small ones2.”\nThe info may be a single word (as above) or more complex (as below):\nذَ ٰلِكَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْمُؤِْمِنِينَ.\n“That is the commander of the believers.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ أَكَلْنَ ٱلطَّعَامَ..\n“Those-ones ate3,f the food.”\nهَـٰذَا ثَوْبُ رَجُلٍ.\n“This is a man’s garment.”\nهَـٰذِهِ كُتُبُهُ.\n“These are his books.”\nهَـٰذَانِ بَيْتَانِ كَبِيرَانِ..\n“These are big houses2.”\nIf the info is a noun that begins with ٱَلْ then it may be placed after the pointing noun subject in the same manner:\n\nWhile the this is permitted and correct, it may be sometimes confused with for the pointing noun phrase “this man”. So, in the same way that we learned in section @ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info), we insert a detached pronoun between the subject and the info, thus:\nهَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\n“This is the man.”\nHere are some more examples:\nهَاتَانِ هُمَا ٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ.\n“These are the girls2.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.\n“Those are the teachers.”\nهَـٰؤُلَاءِ هُنَّ ٱلْأَقْلَامٌ.\n“These are the pens.”\nتِلْكَ هِيَ ٱلْبُيُوتٌ.\n“Those are the houses.”\nهَـٰذَانِ هُمَ ٱلصَّغِيرَانِ.\n“These are the small ones2.”\n\n16.6.1 Mismatched pointing noun subject\nWhen the pointing noun is a subject we usually match its number and gender with the number and gender of the info, as we have been doing so far. However, when the pointing noun subject refers to a noun in a previous sentence, then we may prefer to match to the previous noun than to the the following info. Example:\nبَلَغَنَا خَبَرُ ٱلْمَطَرِ عَلَى ٱلْجَبَالِ. ذَ ٰلِكَ بُشْرَىٰ لِلزُّرَّاعِ.\n“The news of the rain on the mountains has reached us. That is a good tiding for the sowers.”\nNote that the second sentence’s subject and info mismatch:\nذَ ٰلِكَ بُشْرَىٰ\n“That is a good tiding.”\nThe info بُشٌرَىٰ “a good tiding” is a feminine noun but the subject ذَ ٰلِكَ is masculine. This is because ذَ ٰلِكَ is actually referring to خَبَر in the previous sentence which is a masculine noun.",

    "text": "17.3 Vowel-mark on the middle root letter\nWe have seen that vowel on the middle root letter in a perfect verb can vary depending on the verb. So we can have,\n\nكَتَبَ kataba “he wrote”\nعَمِلَ ɛamila “he worked”\nكَبُرَ kabura “he became big”\n\nSimilarly, the vowel on the middle letter in an stateful verb can also vary depending on the verb. Generally, this will need to be looked up in a dictionary and memorized. But there are the following rules which limit the variation:\n\nIf the perfect verb has an fat·ḥah on the middle letter, the stateful verb’s middle letter can have either an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or an ḍammah, depending on the verb. For example,\n\nكَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ kataba yaktubu “he wrote, he writes”\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ d͡hahaba yad͡h·habu “he went, he goes”\nكَشَفَ يَكْشِفُ kas͡hafa yaks͡hifu “he uncovered, he uncovers”\n\nIf the perfect verb has an kasrah on the middle letter, the stateful verb’s middle letter will usually have an fat·ḥah. Rarely, for a few verbs, it may be an kasrah instead. For example,\n\nعَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ ɛamila yaɛmalu “he worked, he works”\nحَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ ḥasiba yaḥsibu “he deemed, he deems” \n\nIf the perfect verb has an ḍammah on the middle letter, the stateful verb’s middle letter shall have a ḍammah. For example,\n\nكَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ kabura yakburu “he grew big, he grows big”\n\n\nIt is possible for some stateful verbs to have more than option for the vowel mark on the middle letter. Both variants give the same meaning for the verb. For example, the perfect verb حَسِبَ ḥasiba “he deemed” has as its incomplete-verb both يَحْسِبُ yaḥsibu and يَحْسَبُ yaḥsabu.",

    "section": "17.4 Verb state",
    "text": "17.4 Verb state\nAs you know, nouns in Arabic have a state that is determined by the function of the noun in the sentence. For example, consider the following sentence:\nسَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلرَّجُلَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ.\nsaʾala -lg͡hulāmu -rrajula ʾan s͡hayʾin.\n“The boy asked the man about something.”\nIn the above sentence, ٱَلْغُلَامُ ʾalg͡hulāmu is the doer of the verb so it is in the u-state and this is indicated by the ḍammah on its final letter. ٱَلرَّجُلَ ʾarrujala is the direct doee of the verb so it is in the a-state and this is indicated by the fat·ḥah on its final letter. شَيْءٍ s͡hayʾin is directly preceded by a preposition so it is in the i-state and this is indicated by the tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ on its final letter. The ending of the perfect verb سَأَلَ is not determined based on the function of the verb in the sentence, and therefore, it does not have any state. (Its ending can change depending on whether a pronoun is attached to it but this is not related to the function of the verb in the sentence and does not represent any state.)\nAs opposed to perfect verbs, which don’t have any state, stateful verbs do have a state which is determinined by the function of the verb in a sentence. Similar to nouns, the state of an stateful verb is indicated by the vowel mark or suffix at the end of the verb.\nStateful verbs have three states, just like nouns. These states are called:\n\nThe u-state\nThe a-state\nThe 0-state\n\nTwo of the states have their names in common with nouns: the u-state and the a-state. The the 0-state is named differently.\nThe ḍammah on the final letter of يَفُعَلُ yafɛalu indicates that it is in the u-state. We will study only the u-state of stateful verbs in this chapter.

    "text": "17.7 With doer pronouns\nWhen we studied perfect verbs, we saw that doer pronouns are either visible or invisible. Visible doer pronouns are added to the end of the verb, modifying the end of the verb in the process.\nThe doer pronouns for stateful verbs are different from the doer pronouns for perfect verbs. Stateful verbs’ doer pronouns are also added to the end of the verb, but in addition to modifying the end of the verb, they modify the beginning of the verb as well. Futhermore, additional letters may be added after the doer pronoun to indicate the state of the verb.\nWe’ll show what all this means in the table below of verbs with doer pronouns. Perfect verbs are included as well so that you can contrast them with their stateful counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerson\nPerfect doer pronoun\nPerfect verb with doer pronoun\nStateful verb doer pronoun\nStateful verb with doer pronoun in the u-state\n\n\n\n\nhe\ninvisible\nفَعَلَ faɛala\ninvisible\nيَفْعَلُ yafɛalu\n\n\nshe\ninvisible\nفَعَلَتْ faɛalat\ninvisible\nتَفْعَلُ tafɛalu\n\n\nyou1,m\nتَ -ta\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\ninvisible\nتَفْعَلُ tafɛalu\n\n\nyou1,f\nتِ -ti\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\nي -ī\nتَفْعَلِينَ tafɛalīna\n\n\nI\nتُ tu\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\ninvisible\nأَفْعَلُ ʾafɛalu\n\n\nthey2,m\nا -ā\nفَعَلَا faɛalā\nا -ā\nيَفْعَلَانِ yafɛalāni\n\n\nthey2,f\nا -ā\nفَعَلَتَا faɛalatā\nا -ā\nتَفْعَلَانِ tafɛalāni\n\n\nyou2\nتُمَا -tumā\nفَعَلْتُمَا faɛaltumā\nا -ā\nتَفْعَلَانِ tafɛalāni\n\n\nthey3+,m\nو -ū\nفَعَلُوا faɛalū\nو -ū\nيَفْعَلُونَ yafɛalūna\n\n\nthey3+,f\nنَ -na\nفَعَلْنَ faɛalna\nنَ -na\nيَفْعَلْنَ yafɛalna\n\n\nyou3+,m\nتُمْ -tumā\nفَعَلْتُمْ faɛaltum\nو -ū\nتَفْعَلُونَ tafɛalūna\n\n\nyou3+,f\nتُنَّ -tunna\nفَعَلْتُنَّ faɛaltunna\nنَ na\nتَفْعَلْنَ tafɛalna\n\n\nwe\nنَا nā\nفَعَلْنَا faɛalnā\ninvisible\nنَفْعَلُ nafɛalu\n\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe verb تَفْعَلُ is used both for “she” and “you2m” doers. Only context will be able to help us differentiate between the two.\nIn stateful verbs which have invisible doer pronouns, the u-state of the verb is indicated by the ḍammah ◌ُ on the final letter of the verb.\nFor stateful verbs that have ا, و, or ي as the doer pronoun, the u-state is indicated by an extraneous ن added to the end of the verb.\nAnd for the remaining stateful verbs whose doer pronoun is نَ, there is no indication of the state of the verb.\n\nHere are some examples of the usage of the doer pronouns:\nRemember that in Arabic, each verb must have it’s own doer, so when there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer, the first verb can be used with the doer noun and the rest with doer pronouns. This is the same behavior as with perfect verbs. For example:\nيَجْلِسُ ٱلرِّجَالُ وَيَأْكُلُونَ وَيَشْرَبُونَ.\nyajlisu -rrijālu wa yaʾkulūna wa yas͡hrabūna.\n“The men sit and (they) eat and (they) drink.”",

    "section": "17.8 Future",
    "text": "17.8 Future\nThe stateful verb is used to express both the present (habitual and progressive) and future tenses. Sometimes all meanings are meant in the same expression. And if only one of the meanings is intended, context can be sufficient to determine which is intended. So, for example,\nيَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nyad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\ncan mean, either one, or even all, of:\n“The man goes.” or\n“The man is going.” or\n“The man will go.”\nArabic does provide a mechanism for specifying that the use of an stateful verb is solely to intend a future action. This is by means of the particles سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa that can be placed before the verb. They provide a meaning of “will” or “will soon”. سَـ sa-, being a single letter particle, is attached to the verb.\nFor example,\nسَيَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nsayad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\nand\nسَوْفَ يَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nsawfa yad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\n“The man will go.” or\n“Soon the man will go.”\nThe difference in usage of سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa can be thought of as one of emphasis. سَوْفَ sawfa is more emphatic than سَـ sa-. This emphasis can translate to more definiteness in the action or even that the action is farther in the future.",

It denotes “the action of going”, or simply “going”.

We will often give a new verb in the format:\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا “to go”\nThe perfect verb for the singular masculine absentee participant “he”, the corresponding stateful verb, and their maṣdar are given together, in sequence. The maṣdar is given in the a-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if Allāh wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: “to go”.",

    "text": "18.2 Patterns of the maṣdar for form 1 verbs\nThe patterns of the maṣdar for form 1 verbs are very variable. It is best to learn the maṣdar when you learn a new verb. Having said that, there are some general trends which may be useful to keep in mind:\n\nIf the verb takes a direct doee, then the perfect verb must necessarily be of the pattern فَعَلَ faɛala or فَعِلَ faɛila (because perfect verbs of the pattern فَعُلَ faɛula never take a direct doee). In this case:\n\nThe maṣdar for many verbs, in general, tends to be فَعْل faɛl. Examples:\n\nفَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا “to open (هـ s.th.)”\nأَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا “to take (هـ s.th.)”\nحَمِدَ يَحْمَدُ حَمْدًا “to praise (ه s.o.)”\n\n\nIf the verb does not take a direct doee, then:\n\nIf the perfect verb is of the pattern فَعِلَ faɛila, then:\n\nIf the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the maṣdar tends to be, in general, of the pattern فَعَل faɛal. Examples:\n\nتَعِبَ يَتْعَبُ تَعَبًا “to become tired”\nجَزِعَ يَجْزَعُ جَزَعًا “to be impatient”\nأَسِفَ يَأْسَفُ أَسَفًا “to be sorrowful”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes being a color, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فُعْلَة fuɛlah. Examples:\n\nخَضِرَ يَخْضَرُ خُضْرَةً “to be green”\nسَمِرَ يَسْمَرُ سُمْرَةً “to be brown”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some work or effort, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُول fuɛūl. Example:\n\nقَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ قُدُومًا “to arrive”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some static quality, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُولَة fuɛūlah. Example:\n\nيَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَة “to be dry”\n\n\nIf the perfect verb is of the pattern فَعَلَ faɛala, then:\n\nIf the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the maṣdar tends to be, in general, of the pattern فُعُول fuɛūl. Examples:\n\nقَعَدَ يَقْعُدُ قُعُودًا “to sit, stay back”\nسَجَدَ يَسْجُدُ سُجُودًا “to prostrate down”\nخَضَعَ يَخْضَعُ خُضُوعًا “to be humble”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes an ailment, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فُعَال fuɛāl. Examples:\n\nسَعَلَ يَسْعُلُ سُعَالً “to cough”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes travelling, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فَعِيل faɛīl. Examples:\n\nرَحَلَ يَرْحَلُ رَحِيلًا “to depart”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes a sound, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فَعِيل faɛīl or فُعَال fuɛāl, or both. Examples:\n\nصَرَخَ يَصْرُخُ صَرِيخًا وَصُرَاخًا “to scream”\n\n\n\nIf the verb denotes a craft or a profession or a rank, then the maṣdar is often of the pattern فِعَالَة fiɛālah. Examples:\n\nتَجَرَ يَتْجُرُ تِجَارَةً “to trade”\nأَمِرَ يَأْمَرُ إِمَارَةً “to be a commander”\n\nIf the perfect verb is of the pattern فَعُلَ faɛula, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُولَة fuɛūlah or فَعَالَة faɛālah. Examples:\n\nصَعُبَ يَصْعُبُ صُعُوبَةً “to be difficult”\nشَجُعَ يَشْجُعُ شَجَاعَةً “to be brave”\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these are only general trends and there are many verbs that have maṣdars which don’t fall under the above rules.",

    "section": "18.3 Usage of the maṣdar",
    "text": "18.3 Usage of the maṣdar\nThe maṣdar has properties of a noun, like state and definiteness. But it gives the meaning of a verb. For example, consider the verb أَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا “to eat”. We can use its maṣdar in a sentence like this:\nفَرَغَ زَيْدٌ مِنَ ٱلْأَكْلِ.\nfarag͡ha zaydun mina -lʾakli.\n“Zayd got done with eating.”\nNote how the maṣdar ٱلْأَكْلِ ʾalʾakli gives the meaning of the action of the verb “eating”. But since it is a noun, it obeys the rules for nouns, like being in the i-state when preceded by the preposition مِنْ min.\nAnother point worth noting is that we have made it definite by saying ٱَلْأَكْلِ ʾalʾakli instead of saying أَكْلٍ ʾaklin for the meaning of “eating”. This is because, as we explained in section @ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns), the definite noun is usually used in Arabic to give a general meaning, where in English we would not use “the”. This may be a good time to re-read that section.\nHaving said that, the indefnite maṣdar may be used too, and this will give the meaning of “a certain”, or “a specific”. For example, with the verb عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا “to work”, we can say:\nفَرَغَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَعْبٍ.\nfarag͡ha min ɛamalin ṣaɛbin.\n“He got done with a [certain] difficult work.”",

    "section": "18.4 Multiple maṣdars for the same verb",
    "text": "18.4 Multiple maṣdars for the same verb\nIt is possible, and fairly common, for verbs to have more than one maṣdar. Usually, each of the maṣdars has its own meaning, distinct from each other.\nFor example, the verb حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلًا means “to carry (هـ s.th.)” Here is an example of its maṣdar in a sentence:\nتَعِبَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ حَمْلِهِ لِلْكُتُبِ ٱلثَّقِيلَةِ.\ntaɛiba zaydun min ḥamlihi lilkutubi -t͡ht͡haqīlati.\n“Zayd became tired from his carrying the heavy books.”\nThere exists another meaning for this verb with its own maṣdar: حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلَةً which means “to launch an attack (عَلَىٰ on s.o.)” Here is an example of its maṣdar in a sentence:\nدَهِشَ ٱلْقَوْمُ مِنْ حَمْلَةِ ٱلْعَدُوِّ عَلَيْهِمْ.\ndahis͡ha -lqawmu min ḥamlati -lɛaduwwi ɛalayhim.\n“The people were astonished at the attack launched by the enemy on them.”\nSometimes the meaning between the multiple maṣdars is only slight. Consider, for example, the verb جَهِلَ يَجْهَلُ “to not know, or to be ignorant (هـ of s.th.)”\nIt has two maṣdars: جَهْلٌ jahl and جَهَالَة jahālah which have meanings that are close to each other.\nجَهْلٌ jahl is the more simple maṣdar used for not knowing something. For example,\nمَا فَعَلَ زَيْدٌ ٱلْوَاجِبَ لِجَهْلِهِ إِيَّاهُ.\nmā faɛala zayduni -lwājiba lijahlihi ʾiyyāhu.\n“Zayd did not do the obligatory [work] because of his not knowing it.”\nجَهَالَة jahālah has the more abstract meaning of “ignorance”. For example,\nنَفَرَ ٱلْمُسْلِمُ مِنْ جَهَالَةِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ.\nnafara -lmuslimu min jahālati -lmus͡hrikīna.\n“The Muslim was repulsed by the ignorance of the pagans.”\nAs a general rule of thumb, the fewer letters in a maṣdar, the simpler its meaning. And maṣdars of the pattern فَعَالَة faɛālah tend to have an abstract meaning.",

    "text": "20.3 After أَنْ ʾan\nأَنْ ʾan “that” is the main article which causes the following stateful verb to be in the a-state. The other articles that we listed in the introduction are all either derived from أَنْ or include its meaning implicitly without expressing it.\n\n20.3.1 Basic usage of أَنْ ʾan with the a-state stateful verb\nأَنْ often follows verbs that have a meaning of wishing or hoping. For example,\nأَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ أَنْ يَنْجَحَ.\nʾamala -ṭṭālibu ʾan yanjaḥ.\n“The student hoped that he succeed.”\nلَا can be used to negate the following a-state stateful verb. لَا combines with أَنْ and assimilates with it to form أَلَّا ʾallā “that not”. For example,\nأَمَرَ ٱلْأَبُ ٱلِٱبْنَ أَلَّا يَكْسَلَ.\nʾamara -lʾabu li-bna ʾallā yaksal.\n“The father ordered the son that he not be lazy.”\nOther than this لَا, أَنْ must directly precede the following a-state stateful verb and must not be separated from it.\n\n\n20.3.2 Grammatical equivalence of أَنْ clause with a maṣdar\nIn grammatical theory, أَنْ and the following verb form a clause that is equivalent in meaning to the maṣdar of the verb. So in the example, أَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ أَنْ يَنْجَحَ., the أَنْ clause is أَنْ يَنْجَحَ. It is equivalent to the maṣdar ٱلنَّجَاح. So the sentence is grammatically equivalent to\nأَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلنَّجَاحَ.\nʾamala -ṭṭālibu -nnajāḥ.\n“The student hoped [for] success.”\nThis grammatical equivalence of the أَنْ clause with a noun aloows the أَنْ clause to take the place of a noun in various positions in a sentence. So, in the above example, the أَنْ clause is in place of the direct doee of the verb أَمَلَ:\n\nWe show other examples below where the أَنْ clause occurs in place of other noun positions.\nAs the subject:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: نَجَاحَكَ هُوَ ٱلْمَقْصِدُ..\nAs the info:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: ٱَلْمَقْصِدُ نَجَاحَكَ..\nAs a doer noun:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: يَحْزُنُنِي ذَهَابُهُ..\nIn the i-state as the base noun in an annexation:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: سَكَتَتْ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ غَضَبِهِ عَلَيْهَا..\nIn the i-state after a preposition:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: رَغِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ فِي أَكْلِ ٱلطَّعَامِ..\n\n\n20.3.3 Option to drop the preposition before أَنْ\nIn the above example the verb رَغِبَ يَرْغَبُ takes an indirect doee after the preposition فِي. In such cases, where the أَنْ clause occurs after a preposition, it is common to drop the preposition as long as there is not resulting confusion in meaning. So, we can also say (without the preposition فِي) for the same meaning:\nرَغِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ ٱلطَّعَامَ.\n“The boy desired that he eat the food.”\n\n\n20.3.4 أَنْ meaning “lest”\nOcassionally, أَنْ is used with the meaning “lest”. For example:\nقَتَلْتُ ٱلثُّعْبَانَ أَنْ يَقْتُلَنِي.\n“I killed the serpent lest it kill me.”\n\n\n20.3.5 أَنْ with the perfect verb\nأَنْ may also occur before a perfect verb. Example:\nبَلَغَنِي أَنْ رَجَعْتَ.\n“That you have returned has reached me.”\n\n\n20.3.6 Other types of أَنْ\nThere are other types of أَنْ in the Arabic language. They all have the basic meaning “that”. But they are used in different grammatical ways.\nThe أَنْ we have learned here is called the maṣdari أَنْ because of the equivalence of its clause with a maṣdar.\nThere is also another type of أَنْ called the lightened أَنْ that we will learn in section @ref(lightened-an).\nThere is also the explanatory أَنْ and the extra أَنْ that we will cover in chapter @ref(types-of-an).",

    "section": "20.4 After لِ li",
    "text": "20.4 After لِ li\n\n20.4.1 The لِ of purpose\nThe article أَنْ may be attached to the preposition لِ li thus: لِأَنْ liʾan to give the purpose of the following verb. This لِ may be translated as “so that”. For example:\nأَكَلَ لِأَنْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate so that he be sated.”\nWhen لِ is thus used, أَنْ is optionally allowed to be dropped while its meaning is retained. لِ is then attached to the verb. So we can say, for the same meaning:\nأَكَلَ لِيَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate so that he be sated.”\nBut when using لَا to negate the verb, then أَنْ must be expressed, and the combination of لِ, أَنْ, and لَا is written as لِئَلَّا liʾallā. For example,\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ لِئَلَّا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water so that he not be thirsty.”\n\nBy the way, the grammatical equivalence of أَنْ and a following a-state stateful verb with a maṣdar applies also to when لِ is used before (either an expressed or an implied) أَنْ. So, for example, if we have a sentence:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِيَعْلَمَ مَفْهُومَهُ.\nor\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِأَنْ يَعْلَمَ مَفْهُومَهُ.\n“He read the book so that he know its meaning.”\nThen, grammatically, أَنْ and what follows it may be expressed with the maṣdar عِلْم thus:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِعِلْمِ مَفْهُومِهِ.\n“He read the book for the knowledge of its meaning.”\n\n\n20.4.2 The لِ of denial\nThere is a specific لِ, called the لِ of denial, which is used with a-state stateful verbs and the verb كَانَ that we will discuss in section (TODO in كَانَ chapter).",

    "section": "20.5 After كَيْ kay",
    "text": "20.5 After كَيْ kay\nكَيْ kay is a preposition similar to لِ in meaning. It may be translated as “in order that”, or also as “so that”. It is also used before the a-state stateful verb. The difference from لِ is that, when لِ is used with the a-state stateful verb, expressing or dropping the أَنْ was optional. But with كَيْ, dropping the أَنْ is mandatory, while its meaning is retained. For example:\nأَكَلَ كَيْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate in order that he be sated.”\nلَا is used, as usual, to negate the verb and is attached to كَيْ thus: كَيْلَا kaylā. Example:\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ كَيْلَا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water in order that he not be thirsty.”\nThe preposition لِ may be combined with كَيْ thus: لِكَيْ likay, for more or less the same meaning. For example:\nأَكَلَ لِكَيْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate in order that he be sated.”\nWith لَا the whole combination is written as لِكَيْلَا likaylā. أَنْ must again be not be expressed.\nExample:\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ لِكَيْلَا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water in order that he not be thirsty.”\nBy the way, كَيْ and a following a-state stateful verb are not directly replaced by a maṣdar. So, for example, if we have a sentence:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ كَيْ يَعْلَمَ مَفْهُومَهُ.\n“He read the book in order that he know its meaning.”\nThen لِ is to be used in place of كَيْ if we wish to replace it and what follows with the maṣdar عِلْم thus:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِعِلْمِ مَفْهُومِهِ.\n“He read the book for the knowledge of its meaning.”",

    "section": "20.6 After حَتَّىٰ ḥattā",
    "text": "20.6 After حَتَّىٰ ḥattā\nحَتَّىٰ ḥattā is a particle that can be used in multiple ways. Its basic meaning is “until” or “to the point of” or “even” where it indicates an extreme limit.\nBefore we discuss its use with a verb following it, we will take a short digression to discuss its use with a following noun.\n\n20.6.1 حَتَّىٰ ḥattā with a following noun\nConsider the following sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ حَتَّىٰ رَأْسِهَا.\n“I ate the fish until its head.”\nحَتَّىٰ “until”, here, is used as a preposition. Therefore, رَأْس is in the i-state, as the noun following a preposition. The meaning of the sentence is that the fish was eaten all the way to its head. (Whether the head itself was eaten or not is ambiguous. The sentence itself admits both meanings.)\nConsider now a variant of this sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ حَتَّىٰ رَأْسَهَا.\n“I ate the fish, even its head.”\nرَأْس, here, is in the a-state because it is a direct doee of the verb أَكَلَ “ate”. The particle حَتَّىٰ “even”, here, is only a connector between the direct doees in much the same way as وَ “and”. (أَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ وَرَأْسَهَا. “I ate the fish and its head.”)\nConsider now yet another variant of this sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ. حَتَّىٰ رَأْسُهَا [أَكَلْتُهَا].\n“I ate the fish. Even its head [I ate].”\nNow رَأْس is in the u-state because it is actually the subject of a new sentence, whose info is (an either expressed or implied) أَكَلْتُهَا “I ate it”. حَتَّىٰ, here, serves as an introductory particle to the second subject and does not affect the state of the following noun.\n\n\n20.6.2 حَتَّىٰ ḥattā with a following verb\n\nJust as حَتَّىٰ is used for different purposes with a following noun, so too is it used with different purposes with a verb following it.\n\n20.6.2.1 حَتَّىٰ with a following a-state stateful verb\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used with an expectation or purpose of a future action of the verb following it, then the verb following it is an a-state stateful verb.  This is done in the following two scenarios:\n\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used to indicate an extreme point at which the action of the following verb would occur, or is meant to occur. Here, حَتَّىٰ may be translated as “to the point of” and the verb following it is translated using “-ing”. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ حَتَّىٰ أَخْتِمَهُ.\n“I read the Qurʾān to the point of finishing it.”\nيَغْضَبُ حَتَّىٰ يَهْرَبُوا مِنْهُ.\n“He becomes angry to the point of their fleeing from him.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ لَا يَمْلِكَ نَفْسَهُ.\n“He became angry to the point of not controlling himself.”\nIt is noteworthy that the use of حَتَّىٰ, here, implies only that the following action is meant to occur, or is at the point of being expected to occur. It doesn’t actually state that the action will actually occur, for something may prevent it from occurring in reality.1\nNote, also, that لَا is not attached to حَتَّىٰ in حَتَّىٰ لَا.\nAlso, similar to the case of كَيْ, there is an assumed (but mandatorily unexpressed) أَنْ which is the real cause of the following stateful verb being in the a-state. In fact, حَتَّىٰ, here, can be considered synonymous to إِلَىٰ أَنْ “to [the point] that”. So the above examples can be considered similar in meaning to:\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ إِلَىٰ أَنْ أَخْتِمَهُ.\nيَغْضَبُ إِلَىٰ أَنْ يَهْرَبُوا مِنْهُ.\nغَضِبَ إِلَىٰ أَلَّا يَمْلِكَ نَفْسَهُ.\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used with the meaning “to such a purpose that”. This is a similar meaning to كَيْ “in order that”. For example,\nأَذْهَبُ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَأْمُرَنِي بِشَيْءٍ.\n“I go to him to such a purpose that he order me [to do] something.”\nوَعَظَ ٱلْأَبُ ٱبْنَهُ حَتَّىٰ يَصْلُحَ.\n“The father admonished his son to such a purpose that he be righteous.”\nAgain, there is an assumed (but mandatorily unexpressed) أَنْ which is the real cause of the following stateful verb being in the a-state.\n\nSometimes, the sentence itself may admit both of the above meanings. For example:\nيَأْكُلُ حَتَّىٰ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He eats to the point of being full.”\nand/or\n“He eats to the purpose that he be full.”\nContext would be needed to determine which meaning or whether both meanings are intended.\n\n\n20.6.2.2 حَتَّىٰ with no effect on the following verb\nIf حَتَّىٰ is not used with any expectation or purpose of a future action of the verb following it, then it has no effect on this verb. (It goes without saying that an implicit أَنْ is not assumed with حَتَّىٰ in this case.)\nThe verb following حَتَّىٰ in this case may even be a perfect verb. For example:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ حَتَّىٰ شَبِعْتُ.\n“I ate the food until I became full.”\nWhen used with a following stateful verb, the verb is put in the u-state and the meaning is that the action of the verb before حَتَّىٰ was done to such an extent that it caused the action of the verb following حَتَّىٰ to definitely occur. The action before حَتَّىٰ must necessarily be a past action, and the action following حَتَّىٰ must necessarily be a present (not a future) action. For example,\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ حَتَّىٰ أَشْبَعُ.\n“I ate the food to such an extent that I am (being) full.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ يَهْرَبُونَ مِنْهُ.\n“He became so angry that they are fleeing from him.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ لَا يَمْلِكُ نَفْسَهُ.\n“He became so angry that he is not controlling himself.”\nCompare these examples with the corresponding ones in the previous sub-section that have an a-state stateful verb.",

    "text": "21.3 With لِ for indirect commands\nThe particle لِ when connected to the front of a stateful verb causes it to be in the 0-state and gives it the meaning of an indirect command. In English this can be translated using “should” or “let”:\nلِيَذْهَبِ ٱَلرَّجُلُ\n“The man should go!”\nor\n“Let the man go!”\n(“Let” is being used here as a command for the man, not for the addressee of this speech.)\nلِنَذْهَبْ!\n“Let’s go!”\nThe indirect command is only rarely used for the addressee participant.1\nSo an example like the following is permissible but rare:\nلِتَجْلِسْ\n“You should sit!”\nInstead, the verb of command is more commonly used which we will study in section @ref(verb-of-command) later in this chapter.\nThe particles فَ “so” and وَ “and” are frequently used before this لِ. The لِ then loses its kasrah and gets a sukūn. Examples:\nفَلْنَأْكُلْ طَعَامَنَا وَلْنَشْرَبْ شَرَابَنَا.\n“So let us eat our food and drink our drink!”\nوَلْيَجْلِسُوا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.\n“And they should sit on the ground!”\nFinally, the لِ before a 0-state stateful verb for the indirect command is mandatory.

    "text": "21.4 With لَا for prohibitions\nThe word لَا when in front of a 0-state stateful verb gives the meaning of a prohibition.

Example:\nفَلَا تَأْكُلْ وَلَا تَشْرَبْ!\n“So don’t eat1,m and don’t drink1,m!”\nSuch prohibitions are generally for the addressee participant. However, rarely, they may be issued for the absentee participant as well. Example:\nلَايَمْنَعْ زَيْدًا ٱلدُّخُولَ.\n“Let him not prevent Zayd from entering!”\n\nBy the way, لَا does not force a verb to be in the u-state 0-state. We have already seen in section @ref(u-state-verb-negation-la) that لَا can be used to negate a u-state stateful verb for the present and future tense. Example:\nلَا يَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nlā yad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\n“The man does not go.” or,\n“The man is not going.” or,\n“The man will not go.”",

    "section": "21.8 The verb of command",
    "text": "21.8 The verb of command\nIn order to give a direct command to an addressee, Arabic uses the verb of command. The verb of command is very similar to the 0-state stateful verb. The verb of command is only available for the addressee participant.\n\n21.8.1 Forming the verb of command\nHere is the verb of command for the addressee participants:\n\n\n\nParticipant\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nyou1,m\nٱفْعَلْ\n\n\nyou1,f\nٱفْعَلِي\n\n\nyou2\nٱفْعَلَا\n\n\nyou3+,m\nٱفْعَلُوا\n\n\nyou3+,f\nٱفْعَلْنَ\n\n\n\nIn order to form the verb of command, we remove the initial ت from the addressee particpant verb. The verb then begins with an sukūn so we place a connecting hamzah in front of it.\nWhen the verb of command occurs in the beginning of a sentence, then the vowel mark for the connecting hamzah is selected according to the following criteria:\n\nWhen the middle root letter of the verb of command has an ḍammah ◌ُ, then the connecting hamzah gets an ḍammah too. Examples:\n\n\n\nVerb\nVerb of command for “he”\n\n\n\n\nنَظَرَ يَنْظُرُ نَظَرًا\nٱُنْظُرْ “Look!”\n\n\nقَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا\nٱُقْتُلْ “Kill!”\n\n\nمَكَثَ يَمْكُثُ مُكُوثًا\nٱُمْكُثْ “Stay!”\n\n\n\nOtherwise, when the middle root letter of the verb of command has an fat·ḥah ◌َ or an kasrah ◌ِ, then the connecting hamzah gets an kasrah ◌ِ. Examples:\n\n\n\nVerb\nVerb of command for “he”\n\n\n\n\nعَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا\nٱِعْمَلْ “Work!”\n\n\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا\nٱِذْهَبْ “Go!”\n\n\nجَلَسَ يَجْلِسُ جُلُوسًا\nٱِجْلِسْ “Sit!”\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of using the verb of command:\nThe verb of command is not used to issue negative commands, like “Don’t go!”. Instead, the 0-state verb is used with لَا as described in section @ref(la-of-prohibition) above.\nلَا تَذْهَبْ\n“Don’t go!”\n\n\n21.8.2 The verb of command for roots begin with hamzah\nAppendix @ref(hamzarules) details the rules for speeling words that contain hamzah generally. In addition to those rules, the verb of command for roots that begin with hamzah warrant additional discussion.\nConsider the following form 1 verbs and their verbs of command for the singular masculine addressee doer “he”:\n\n\n\nRoot\nVerb\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nأمل\nأَمَلَ يَأْمُلُ أَمَلًا “to hope”\nٱؤْمُلْ\n\n\nأذن\nأَذِنَ يَأذَنُ أَذَنًا “to permit”\nٱئْذَنْ\n\n\n\nHere are examples of these verbs of commands in the middle of a sentence:\nيَا أُمِّي ٱئْذَنِي لِي ٱللَّعِبَ!\nyā ʾummi -ʾd͡hanī li -llaɛib!\n“O my mother, permit me to play!”\nيَا زَيْدُ ٱؤْمُلِ ٱلْخَيْرَ!\nyā zaydu -ʾmuli -lk͡hayr!\n“O Zayd, hope for good!”\nWhen these verbs of command occur in the beginning of the sentence, then there would be two hamzahs occuring next to each other which is not permitted. So the second hamzah is pronounced as a long vowel, though it may still be written as a hamzah. Examples:\nٱُؤمُلِ ٱلْخَيْرَ يَا زَيْدُ!\nʾūmul\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ʾuʾmul\nٱِئذَنِي لِي ٱللَّعِبَ يَا أُمِّي!\nʾīd͡hanī\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ʾiʾd͡hanī\nAs a further complication, when the verb of command is preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so” then the connecting hamza is not written and the hamzah of the first root letter is written seated on an alif. Examples:\nوَأْمُلْ\nwaʾmul\n“And hope!”\nفَأْذَنْ\nfaʾd͡han\n“So permit!”\n\n\n21.8.3 Irregular verbs of command\nIn addition to the rules states above there are four verbs of command (all containing hamzah) that are irregular. We will discuss them below:\n\n21.8.3.1 The verbs أَكَلَ , أَخَذَ , and أَمَرَ\nThe verbs of command for the following three verbs are irregular:\n\n\n\nRoot\nVerb\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nأكل\nأَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا “to eat”\nكُلْ\n\n\nأخذ\nأَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا “to take”\nخُذْ\n\n\nأمر\nأَمَرَ يَأْمُرُ أَمْرًا “to order”\nمُرْ\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the initial hamzah has been completely deleted for the verbs of command. However, of these verbs, the verb of command for أَمَرَ يَأْمُرُ أَمْرًا is permitted to retain its initial hamzah when preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so”. Then, it becomes\nوَأْمُرْ waʾmur\nand\nفَأْمُرْ faʾmur\nThis retaining of the initial hamzah is not done for the other two verbs.\nHere are some examples of these verbs of command:\n\n\n21.8.3.2 The verb سَأَلَ\nThe verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا “to question” forms its verb of command both regularly, and irregularly:\n\nRegular: ٱسْأَلْ ʾisʾal\nIrregular: سَلْ sal\n\nIf the verb of command is preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so”, then the regular verb of command ٱسْأَلْ ʾisʾal is often preferred.\nOtherwise, the irregular verb of command سَلْ sal is often preferred.\nExamples of usage:",

    "text": "22.2 Forming the passive verb\nSo far we have been studing form 1 verbs, which use only the three root letters. As we know, the vowel on the middle root letter is variable for active verbs, for example:\n\nشَرِبَ يَشْرَبُ “to drink”.\nفَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ “to open”\nكَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ “to become big”\netc.\n\nThe pattern of passive verb for form 1 verbs is always:\nفُعِلَ يُفْعَلُ\nfuɛila yufɛalu\nThis is regardless of the vowel on the middle root letter in the active verb. If there is more than one verb from the same root, with different middle root letter vowels for the active verb, then they will share the same passive verb. For example, the active verbs: حَسَبَ يَحْسُبُ “to reckon” and حَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ “to deem” share the same passive verb: حُسِبَ يُحْسَبُ.\nThe same doer pronouns are used for the passive verb as for the active verb. And the passive stateful verb has the same three states as the active stateful verb. For example:\n\nفُعِلُوا fuɛilū “they3m” (perfect)\nتُفْعَلَانِ tufɛalāni “you2” or “they2f” (u-state stateful)\nأُفْعَلَ ʾufɛala “I” (a-state stateful)\netc.\n\nThe complete table showing the doer pronouns is given in appendix @ref(verb-tables).",

    "section": "22.3 The deputy doer",
    "text": "22.3 The deputy doer\nConsider again this sentence with an passive verb construction:\n\n\nNote that the noun ٱَلْمَاءُ ʾalmāʾu “the water” is in the u-state. This is because, in the absence of the doer, the direct doee of the active verb (ٱَلْمَاءَ) is deputized to take doer’s place in the u-state. It is then known as the deputy doer.\nThe doer pronouns for the passive verb shall therefore match the gender and number of the deputy doer. Here are some examples:\nشُكِرَتِ ٱلأُمَّهَاتُ وَمُدِحْنَ.\ns͡hukirati -lʾummahātu wamudiḥn.\n“The mothers were thanked and praised.”\nأَنْتُمَا تُغْبَنَانِ وَتُخْدَعَانِ.\nʾantumā tug͡hbanāni watuk͡hdaɛān.\n“You2 are being cheated and deceived.”\nمَا قُطِعَتِ ٱلشَّجَرَةُ.\nmā quṭiɛati -s͡hs͡hajarah.\n“The tree was not cut.”\n\n22.3.1 The deputy doer for multiple direct doees\nSome verbs, in the active construction, take multiple direct doee. These verbs can be classified into two classes: \n\nVerbs that cause the first direct doee to be affected by, or asked for, the second direct doee. Examples: \nمَلَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلدَّلْوَ مَاءً.\n“The boy filled the bucket (with) water.”\nمَنَعَ ٱلْمَرَضُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلْعَمَلَ.\n“Sickness prevented the man (from) work.”\nسَأَلَ ٱلْفَقِيرُ ٱلْغَنِيَّ دِرْهَمًا.\n“The poor [man] asked the rich [man] (for) a dirham.”\nVerbs that siginify an action of the heart or of intention, like thinking, deeming, making, etc. Examples:\nحَسِبْتُ زَيْدًا صَدِيقًا.\n“I deemed Zayd [to be] a friend”\nوَجَدَتِ ٱلطَّالِبَةُ ٱلْأُسْتَاذَةَ حَلِيمَةً.\n“The studentf found the professorf [to be] forbearing.”\nجَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلْمَاءَ بَرَكَةً.\n“Allāh has made the water a blessing.”\n\nWhen such verbs are converted to the passive verb construction, then one, and only one, direct doee shall be chosen to be the deputy doer. It is generally preferred to make the first direct doee the deputy-doer, and leave the second direct doee, as is, in the a-state. Here are the same sentences in the passive construction:\nمُلِئَتِ ٱلدَّلْوُ مَاءً. (دَلْو “bucket” is feminine.)\n“The bucket was filled (with) water.”\nمُنِعَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْعَمَلَ.\n“The man was prevented (from) work.”\nسُئِلَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ دِرْهَمًا.\n“The rich [man] was asked for a dirham.”\nحُسِبَ زَيْدٌ صَدِيقًا.\n“Zayd was deemed [to be] a friend”\nوُجِدَتِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذَةُ حَلِيمَةً.\n“The professorf was found [to be] forbearing.”\nجُعِلَ ٱلْمَاءُ بَرَكَةً.\n“Water has been made a blessing.”",

    "section": "22.4 Impersonal use",
    "text": "22.4 Impersonal use\nTODO: add examples from Wright p. 268\nWhen verbs are used without a direct doee, then their passive construction gives in an impersonal meaning. There are a few such usages that we will explain in the following subsections.\n\n22.4.1 With prepositional phrases\nSome verbs take no direct doees, but are used with prepositional phrases. For example,\nجَلَسَ ٱلنَّاسُ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.\n“The people sat upon the ground.”\nOther verbs, which can take a direct doee, may be used without one, and again with a prepositional phrase instead. For example:\nكَتَبَ ٱلْكَاتِبُ بِٱلْقَلَمِ.\n“The scribe wrote with the pen.”\nWhen such sentences are converted to the passive verb construction then the prepositional phrase may be taken as the deputy doer. However, the preposition causes the noun following it to remain in the i-state. So the deputy doer is not indicated by an apparent ḍammah (or by the other indicators of the u-state). The verb then appears to be in the singular masculine, with its deputy doer following it. For example:\n\n\nكُتِبَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ.\n“The pen was written with.”\n\n\n22.4.2 With adverbs of time or place\nOther verbs don’t take a direct doee but may be used with an adverb of time or place in the a-state. (We will study adverbs of time and place in chapter @ref(adverbs-of-time-and-place), if Allāh wills.) Here is an example:\n\n\nWhen this sentence is converted to an passive construction then the adverb of time or place can be taken as the deputy doer in the u-state:\nسُهِرَتْ لَيلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ.\n“The Night of Power was stayed up [in].”\nNote the u-state of لَيْلَةُ laylatu as the deputy doer.\n\n\n22.4.3 With the maṣdar\nThe maṣdar, because it is the action being done may be considered a kind of direct doee. (We will study the use of the maṣdar as a doee in chapter @ref(absolute-doee), if Allāh wills.) For example:\nفَهِمَ ٱلشَّيْخُ فَهْمًا عَمِيقًا.\n“The old man understood, a deep understanding.”\nWhen such sentences are converted to the passive verb construction, then the maṣdar may be taken as the deputy doer in the u-state.\nفُهِمَ فَهْمٌ عَمِيقٌ.\n“A deep understanding was understood.”\n\n\n22.4.4 Requirement of specialization\nWhen a prepositional phrase, or an adverb of time or place, or a maṣdar is to be used as a deputy doer in an passive verb construction, then it is required that they be specialized in meaning, and not used in a general sense. So for example, if we have the sentence:\nسَهَرَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لَيلَةً.\n“The mother stayed up a night.”\nthen because of the non-specialized meaning of لَيْلَةً, such a sentence is typically not suitable for being converted to a passive verb construction.\n\n\n22.4.5 Choosing the deputy doer\nIf a sentence is to be converted to an passive verb construction and it has more than one of the following:\n\na direct doee\na specialized prepositional phrase\na specialized adverb of time or place\na specialized maṣdar\n\nThen only one shall be chosen as the deputy doer. If a direct doee exists, then it is typically chosen. If a direct doee does not exist, then the one desired to be emphasized may be chosen as the deputy doer. For example:\nسُهِرَ فِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ لَيلَةَ ٱلْقَدْرِ.\n“The mosque was stayed up in [on] the Night of Power.”\nIn the above sentence the prepositional phrase فِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ was chosen as the deputy doer, and the adverb of time لَيْلَةَ remains, as is, in the a-state.",

    "text": "22.5 States of the passive stateful verb\nThe passive stateful verb has three states, just like the active stateful verb: the u-state, the a-state, and the 0-state. The three states are used in the same circumstances, and with the same rules that we have already learned.\nSo the u-state verb is used for making plain statements:\nتُذْكَرُ قِصَّةُ ٱلْمَلِكِ فِي كُتُبِ ٱلتَّأْرِيخِ.\n“The story of the king is mentioned in the books of history.”\nلَا تُرْفَعُ ٱلْأَصْوَاتُ فِي ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ.\n“Voices are not raised in the library.”\nThe a-state verb is used for expressing wish or purpose:\nيَأْمُلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ أَنْ يُغْفَرُ لَهُمْ.\n“The Muslims hope that they be forgiven.”\n(Note that يُغْفَرَ has a singular masculine deputy doer because there is no direct doee.)\nلَنْ تُسْمَعَا.\n“You2 shall not be heard.”\nدُفِعَ ٱلْبَابُ حَتَّىٰ يُفْتَحَ.\n“The door was pushed for the result that it open.”\nSimilarly, the 0-state verb is used in the following cases:\n\nWith لَمْ “was not”:\nلَمْ يُؤْذَنْ لِي أَنْ أَدْخُلَ.\n“It was not permitted for me that I enter.”\nWith لَمَّا “not yet”\nلَمَّا يُكْتَبْ كِتَابٌ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْمَوْضُوعِ.\n“A book has not yet been written in this subject.”\nWith لِ for indirect commands1:\nلِيُسْمَعْ صَوْتُهُ!\n“Let his voice be heard!”\nThere is no verb of command for passive verbs. So while indirect commands are typically not used for the addressee participant for active verbs (see section @ref(indirect-commands)), they are the only way to issue commands for the addressee participant in the passive verb construction:\nلِتُنْصَرُوا!\n“Let you3m be aided!”",

We will explain them below:\n\n22.6.1 Permissible use of the passive verb\nThere can be a number of reasons why a speaker is forced to, or chooses to, use the passive verb construction. Among these reasons are:\n\nWhen the doer is actually unknown to the speaker. This is the classic use-case, as indicated by the name passive verb. (But, as we shall see below, it is not the only use case.) So, if we say:\nكُسِرَتِ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ.\n“The glass was broken.”\nthen, it may be that we don’t know who broke the glass, and that is why we are expressing it in the passive verb construction.\nWhen the doer is known to the speaker, but he does not wish to make him known to others. So the same sentence above كُسِرَتِ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ. could be used when the speaker knows that it was actually زَيْد “Zayd”, for example, who broke the glass, but the speaker does not wish that others find out that it was Zayd. This itself could be for any reason, for example: the speaker fears Zayd, for fears for Zayd, etc.\nWhen the speaker wishes to draw attention to the act itself rather than the doer of the act. So we might say:\nمُنِعْنَا ٱلدُّخُولَ.\n“We have been prevented from entering.”\nwhen we wish to focus on the act of our having been prevented, rather than who prevented us.\nFor stylistic reasons, when it is obvious and known who the doer is. For example:\nخُلِقَ ٱلْإِنْسَانُ مِنْ ْعَجَلٍ\n“Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience].” (Qurʾān 21:37. Trans. Saheeh International)\nIn the above ʾāyah it is known and obvious that Allāh created man.\nIn order to glorify the doer. So we might the passive verb construction to say:\nخُلِقَ ٱلْخِنْزِيرُ.\n“The pig was created.”\nThis could be to distance Allāh from being mentioned next to the name of a particularly dirty animal.\nWhen the doer is not mentioned due to contempt for him. For example:\nقُتِلَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عُمَرُ.\n“The Commander of the believers, Ɛumar, was killed.”\nIn this sentence we chose not to name the killer due to contempt for him.\n\nThese reasons are not mutually exclusive, and sometimes the passive verb construction is used for a combination of them.\n\n\n22.6.2 Impermissible use of the passive verb\nThe passive verb may not be used when the doer is mentioned with the verb. This is different from English which can use the word “by” to indicate the doer in a passive voice construction, as in: “The book was written by Zayd.”. Such a sentence, in Arabic can only be expressed with the active verb construction:\nكَتَبَ زَيْدٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba zayduni -lkitāb.\n“Zayd wrote the book.”\nIt may seem like this rule is broken in sentences like:\nقُتِلَ بِٱلسَّيْفِ.\nqutila bi-ssayf.\n“He was killed by the sword.”\nBut such is not the case. The active verb constuction would be something like:\nقَتَلَهُ فُلَانٌ بِٱلسَّيْفِ.\nqatalahu fulānun bi-ssayf.\n“So-and-so killed him with the sword.”\nAs you can see, فُلَان “so-and-so” is actually the doer, and ٱلسَّيْف “the sword” is merely a prepositional phrase indicating the instrument used in the act.",

There are about 15 or so additional forms of the verb. But only 10 or so are in common usage.\nLearning these additional forms may seem tedious but we advise you to persevere because additional forms of the verb are used very commonly.\nThe form 1 verb has variability in the middle (ع) letter, which can have either an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or ḍammah. It also has variability in the pattern its maṣdar. The additional forms have almost no variability of this kind. So, in one sense, the additional forms of the verb are easier than the form 1 verb.",

In other words it is falsifiable. For example, if we have a statement:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nThe above statement may be judged to have a truth value. If zayd is actually standing, then the statement is true. And if zayd is not standing, then the statement is false.\nA non-truth-evaluable statement, on the other hand, does not have a truth value. Here are some examples of non-truth-evaluable statements:\n\nاضْرِبْ زَيْدًا\nBeat Zayd!\nلَا تَفْعَلْ\nDon’t do [it]!\nيَا زَيْدُ\nO Zayd\nمَنْ هُوَ\nWho is he?\n\n\n\n25.1.2 Syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics\n\nSyntax and semantics\nSemantics is the study of the meanings of words. And syntax is the study of how words combine to form phrases and sentences. Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships between the words in a sentence. For example, consider the adjectival noun كَبِير. Semantically, it gives the meaning of something being big. When it is in a linguistic environment, like a phrase or a sentence, then its syntactical role is determined by the grammatical relationships it has with other words in the sentence.\nConsider the following sentence:\n\nالْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ\nThe house is big\n\nIn the above sentence, كَبِير is syntactically a info.\nNow consider the following sentence:\n\nدَخَلَ بَيْتًا كَبِيرًا\nHe entered a big house.\n\nNow the same noun كَبِير is syntactically a attribute. In both examples, كَبِير has the same semantic signification.\n\n\n\nPragmatics\n\nPragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in a specific context or situation.\n\n\n\nStylistics\nIn order to express a meaning, there will often be a normal way to choose words or construct a sentence’s structure. If, for some effect (rhetorical, persuasive, literary, etc.), the speaker chooses to deviate from this norm, then he is doing so for stylistic reasons.1",

These are called stateful elements. The stateful elements are nouns and stateful verbs. A noun may be either in the u-state, a-state, or i-state. And a stateful verb may be either in the u-state, a-state, or 0-state. The theory of government states that a stateful element is put in a particular state by a governor. For example:\n\nفِي الدَّارِ\nin the house\n\nIn the above example,  the gpreposition فِي causes the noun الدَّار to be in the i-state.

This structure requires two structural elements in order to be structurally complete.2 These two structural elements are:\n\nThe structure-starter\nThe structure-completer\n\n\nThe structure-starter is the primary structural element. It represents whom the sentence is about, i.e. its topic. The structure-completer rests against the structure-starter.  It expresses some property about the structure-starter that completes the meaning of the sentence.\nOnce the two structural elements are in place, the sentence is structurally complete. Other dispensable elements (see section (ref) below) may be added in addition to the structural elements to add meaning to the sentence, but they are not required to make the sentence structurally complete.\nLet’s look at the structural elements for the two types of Arabic sentences:\n\n\n25.4.1 The structural elements of a nounal sentence\nIn a nounal sentence the subject is the structure-starter and the info is the structure-completer. Consider the following nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nDIAGRAM\nExample (10) above is a nounal sentence. The subject زَيْدٌ is the structure-starter.

Consider the following verbal sentence:\n\nقَامَ زَيْدٌ\n\nDIAGRAM\nExample (11) above is a verbal sentence. The doer زَيْدٌ is the structure-starter. It is the topic of the sentence.

And a nounal sentence is one that begins with a verb. We will now refine these definitions:\n\nA nounal sentence is one whose structural elements are two nouns: a subject (as the structure-starter) and an info (as the structure-completer). And a verbal sentence is one whose structural elements are a verb (as the structure-starter) and and its doer (as the structure-completer).\nConsider, for example, the following sentence:\n\nبَلْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nRather Zayd is standing.\n\nThe first word in the sentence above is بَلْ. It is a particle and not a structural element. Removing it from the sentence, we see that the remaining structural elements are two nouns: زَيْدٌ (the subject) and قَائِمٌ (as the info). So the sentence is a nounal sentence.\nLet’s take a look at another example:\n\nزَيْدًا رَأَيْتُ [Peled, Sentence types 28]\n[It was] Zayd I saw.\n\nThe first word in the sentence is زَيْدًا.

    "text": "25.8 Identifying the structural elements in a nounal sentence\nIt can sometimes be complicated to tell which of the twp structural elements in a nounal sentence is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer. We will discuss several cases below:\n\n25.8.1 When there is an overt foundational government\nWhen there is an overt foundational government, like إِنَّ, كَانَ, etc., then it is usually easy to tell which is the structure-starter and which is the structure-completer. For example:\n\nفَإِنَّ حَسۡبَكَ ٱللَّهُ [سورة الأنفال 8:62]\nthen sufficient for you is Allāh\n\nIn example (19) above, حَسْب is in the a-state as the subject and the word ٱللَّهُ is in the u-state as the info. This tells us that حَسْب is the structure-starter and the word ٱللَّهُ is the structure-completer.\n\n\n25.8.2 One structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite\nWhen one structural element is definite and the other structural element is indefinite, then it is usually the case that the definite element is the structure-starter (as the subject) and the indefinite element is the structure-completer (as the info).\nIn terms of pragmatics, the structure-starter and the structure-completer represent ‘given’ and ‘new’ information. That is, the listener knows who the structure-starter is and can identify him or it. So the structure-starter is a ‘given’ to the listener. And the speaker is providing ‘new’ information about the structure-starter to the listener. The definite element represents the ‘given’ information, which the listener already knows. And the indefinite element represents ‘new’ information.\nLet’s take a look at an example:\n\nتَمِيمِيٌّ أَنَا [Peled, Sentence types 121]\nA Tamīmite I am.\n\nThe pronoun أَنَا is definite. Therefore it is the structure-starter (as the subject). And the word تَمِيمِيٌّ is indefinite. Therefore it is the structure-completer (as the info). Example (20) is an inverted order sentence where the info is fronted and the subject is placed after it.\nIn special cases, some grammarians hold that it is possible to have an indefinite subject and a definite info.4 One special case is when a question noun is the subject. (Question nouns are considered indefinite.) For example:\n\nكَمْ مَالُكَ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/231]\nHow much is your wealth?\nأَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ [جامع الترمذي :3513]\nWhich night is the night of Decree\n\nAnother special case is when the subject is an indefinite comparative noun in sentences like:\n\nخَيْرٌ مِنْكَ زَيْدٌ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/231]\nBetter than you is Zayd\n\nIn the above sentence, خَيْرٌ is considered the subject of the sentence.  \n\n\n25.8.3 Both structural elements are definite\nWhen both structural elements are definite, then typically the first is the subject and the second is the info. For example:\n\nالدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ [صحيح مسلم :55a]\nThe Religion is sincerity.\n\nHowever, if it is known from context that one if the two elements is the ‘given’ information and the other is the ‘new’ information, then the given information will be the subject and the new information will be the info, regardless of word-order.5\nFor example, consider a situation where one wishes to say, “Abū Yūsuf is [like] Abū Ḥanīfah.” (Imām Abū Yūsuf was the foremost student of Imām Abū Ḥanīfah.) The normal way to express this sentence is:\n\nأَبُو يُوسُفَ أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/233]\nAbū Yūsuf is [like] Abū Ḥanīfah.\n\nDIAGRAM\nHowever, if it is pragmatically known that the topic of the sentence is أَبُو يُوسُفَ, then it is ‘given’ that أَبُو يُوسُفَ is the structure-starter (as the subject). Similarly, it is known that likening him to أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ is the ‘new’ information. Therefore, أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ is the structure-completer (as the info). In this case, the sentence order can be flexible, and the info can be fronted (stylistically), for the same meaning, thus:\n\nأَبُو حَنِيفَةَ أَبُو يُوسُفَ\n[Like] Abū Ḥanīfah, Abū Yūsuf is.\n\nDIAGRAM\n\n\n25.8.4 Both structural elements are indefinite\nWhen both structural elements are indefinite then, again, the first is likely to be the subject and the second to be the info. Examples:\n\nأَفْضَلُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/232]\n[The person] better than Zayd is better than Ɛamr.\nوَجَزَ ٰ⁠ۤؤُا۟ سَیِّئَةࣲ سَیِّئَةࣱ مِّثۡلُهَاۖ [سورة الشورى 42:40]\nAnd the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it",

    "text": "25.9 The info as a complete sentence\nIn a nounal sentence, the info is, by default, a single noun. See example (1) again:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nIn example (1), قَائِمٌ is a single word and it is the info. This is what we may call a simple nounal sentence.\nIn contrast, in a compound nounal sentence, the info is itself a complete sentence. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd – he stands\n\nIn example (29) above, زَيْدٌ is the subject and يَقُومُ is the info. But يَقُومُ is not a single word here. It is in fact a complete sentence. This is because, as we know, a verb must be followed by its doer. And if there is no overt doer, then a latent doer pronoun is implicated. So يَقُومُ is a a verbal sentence with the meaning he stands.\nHere is example of a compound nounal sentence, whose info is also a nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٌ [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/26]\nZayd – his father is standing.\n\n(FIXME: MOVE THIS TO KAANA CHAPTER):\nCompound sentences are very common with كَانَ. Remember from section (ref) above that كَانَ is a deficient verb, and thus needs a info to grammatically the sentence. This info may be a single word, like:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا\nZayd was standing.\n\nOr the info of كَانَ may be a complete sentence:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd used to stand.\n\n(END FIXME)\nThe info of a compound nounal sentence is typically a truth-evaluable sentence. But it need not be so. A non-truth-evaluable sentence is also valid as a info6 For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ اضْرِبْهُ [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/27]\nZayd – hit him!\n(i.e. Hit Zayd!)\n\n\n25.9.1 The government of the compound nounal sentence sentence\nThe info of a compound nounal sentence is a complete sentence. Therefore, it has its own independent internal government for all elements within it (including its own foundational government). But the entire info is governed, albeit not markedly, by a governor in the outer sentence. For example, consider the following compound nounal sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا\nZayd – he did not hit Ɛamr\n\nIn example (34) above, لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا is a complete sentence that is the info of the outer sentence. This inner sentence has its own internal government, starting with its foundational government لَمْ. The foundational government لَمْ governs the verb يَضْرِبْ in the 0-state. And the verb يَضْرِبْ governs an implicated latent doer pronoun (هُوَ) in the u-state, and the direct doee عَمْرًا in the a-state.\nWe will say that the inner sentence لَمْ يَضْرِبْ عَمْرًا is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the outer sentence.\nThe government of this compound sentence is illustrated in the diagram below:\nDIAGRAM\n\n\n\n25.9.2 Invalid inner sentences\nSome sentences are not valid as inner sentences:\n\nA sentence beginning with لَـٰكِنْ, حَتَّى, or بَلْ is not valid.7\nA vocative sentence is not valid.8 So. we cannot say, for example:\n\n✗ زيد يا أخاه [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 4/28]\n“Zayd – O his brother.”\n\n\n\n\n25.9.3 The link between the inner and outer sentence\nIt is usually necessary for there to be a link between the inner sentence, and the subject of the outer sentence. This link is typically supplied by a pronoun. Let’s look at some examples:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَامَ أَبُوهُ [المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278]\nZayd – his father stood up.\n\nDIAGRAM\nIn example (36) above, the link is the pronoun هُ in abuuhu.\n\nزَيْدٌ قَامَ [المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278]\nZayd – he stood up.\n\nDIAGRAM\nIn example (37) above, the link is the implied singular masculine pronoun that is the doer of قَامَ.\nGenerally, if there is no such link between the inner sentence and the subject of the outer sentence, then the compound sentence is invalid.9{.citex} So we cannot say, for example:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ قَامَ عَمْرٌ [Peled, Sentence types 94 citing شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل]\nZayd – Ɛamr stood up\n\n\nA pointing noun as the link\nInstead of a pronoun, an pointing noun may serve as the link. For example:\n\nوَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقۡوَىٰ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ خَیۡرࣱۚ [سورة الأعراف 7:26 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nBut the clothing of righteousness - that is best.\n\n\n\nA repeated subject as the link\nThe subject of the outer sentence may be repeated in the inner sentence, and this is sufficient as the link. For example:\n\nٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝١ مَا ٱلۡحَاۤقَّةُ ۝٢ [سورة الحاقة 69:1-2 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nThe Inevitable Reality - What is the Inevitable Reality?\n\n\n\nNo need for the link\nIn cases where the info of the outer sentence is more general than its subject a link is not needed. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nZayd – an excellent man\n\nThe link is also not needed when the subject of the outer sentence and its info are perfectly identical in meaning. For example:\n\nنُطْقِي اللَّهُ حَسْبِي [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nMy utterance is “Allāh is sufficient for me.”\nقَوْلِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ [Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204]\nMy saying is “There is no god but Allāh.”\n\n\n\nAn implied link\nThe link, even when technically required, is sometimes omitted. But it remains implied. This is in cases in which the sense is perfectly clear without it.10 For example:\n\nٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ بِدِرْهَمٍ [Wright 2/256C; المقتصد للجرجاني 1/278; شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/238]\nThe ghee is (at the rate of) two manās for a dirham.\n\nIn the example above, the sentence with the link restored is ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ مِنْهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ two manās of it for a dirham.",

    "section": "25.10 Other complete sentences in place of nouns",
    "text": "25.10 Other complete sentences in place of nouns\nIt is not only the info which can be replaced with a complete sentence. Other grammatical categories are also, by default, a single noun, but which can be replaced with complete sentences. We will discuss some of these categories below, and treat other categories in their respective chapters (like the ḥāl, the condition-response, and verbs of perception).\n\n\n25.10.1 The direct doee as a complete sentence\nA sentence which is direct speech occurs in the place of a direct doee. For example:\n\nقَالَ إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ [سورة مريم 19:30 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/23]\n[Jesus] said, “Indeed, I am the servant of Allāh.\n\nIn the example above, the sentence إِنِّی عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ is in place of the a-state direct doee of قَالَ.\nA complete sentence can also occur as a direct doee with verbs of perception. Examples:\n\nظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا يَقْرَأُ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/24]\nI believed Zayd [to be] reading.\n\nIn the example above, the verbal sentence يَقْرَأُ is in place of the a-state direct doee of ظَنَنْتُ. We will learn more about this category in chapter (ref), if Allāh wills.\n\n\n25.10.2 The attribute as a complete sentence\nThe attribute is, in principle, a single noun.\nHowever, an sentence entire sentence may occur in place of the single noun. For example, instead of saying مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ قَائِمٍ, we can replace the single word attribute قَائِمٍ with the sentence يَقُومُ, thus:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَقُومُ [الإيضاح للفارسي 308]\nI passed by a man [that] stands.\n(literally: I passed by a ‘he stands’ man.\n\nNote that the stateful verb يَقُومُ is in the u-state. This is because يَقُومُ is a complete sentence (with an implied doer pronoun). So it has its own internal government that is not affected by any element in the outer sentence. Thus, the state of the attributee رَجُلٍ has no effect on any state within the sentence-attribute. However, the entire sentence attribute is in place of a i-state noun as the attribute of رَجُلٍ.\nSubstituing a single-noun attribute with its corresponding stateful verb is the most basic form of the sentence-attribute. However, more complex sentence-attributes may also be formed. For example:\n\nوَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ [سورة البقرة 2:281 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/276]\nAnd fear a Day when you will be returned to Allāh.\n\nIn example (48) above, the sentence تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ is a attribute of يَوْمًا.\n\nThere are three conditions that must be met in order for a sentence to occur as a attribute^: [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/275–278]\n\nThe attributee must be indefinite, either in wording or in meaning.\nThe sentence-attribute must contain a link that links back to the attributee.\nThe sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable.\n\nLet’s discuss each of these conditions.\n\nIndefiniteness of the attributee\nWe already saw an example of an indefinite (in wording) attributee in example (48) above. Here is an example of a attributee which is definite in wording, but indefinite in meaning:\n\nوَلَقَدْ أَمُرُّ عَلَى اللَّئِيمِ يَسُبُّنِي [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/276]\nAnd indeed I pass by the ignoble [person that] insults me\n\nIn example (49) the attributee اللَّئِيمِ is referring to a general person, and is therefore indefinite in meaning.\n\n\nA link that links back to the attributee\nIn example (48), the link, which links back to the attributee يَوْمًا, is the pronoun ه in فِيهِ.\nSometimes the link is not explicit, but is implied. For example:\n\nوَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا لَّا تَجۡزِی نَفۡسٌ عَن نَّفۡسࣲ شَیۡـࣰٔا [سورة البقرة 2:123 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/277]\nAnd fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all\n\nThe implied link is the pronoun ه in an implied فِيهِ, i.e. لَا تَجْزِی فِيهِ.\n\n\nThe sentence-attribute should be truth-evaluable\nThe following sentence is impermissible because the attribute اضْرِبْهُ is a non-truth-evaluable sentence.\n\n✗ مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ اضْرِبْهُ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 3/278]\nI passed by a man – hit him\n\n\n\n\n25.10.3 The base noun in an annexation as a complete sentence\nThe base noun in an annexation may be a complete sentence instead of a single noun. For example:\n\nهَـٰذَا یَوۡمُ یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّـٰدِقِینَ صِدۡقُهُمۡۚ [سورة المائدة 5:119 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/28]\nThis is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.\n\nIn example (52) above the entire sentence یَنفَعُ ٱلصَّادِقِینَ صِدْقُهُمْ is the base noun to the annexe noun يَوْمُ. As with sentence-infos and sentence-attributes, the sentence-base noun has its own internal government. And the sentence-base noun is in place of an i-state noun.\nHere is another example:\n\nیَوۡمَ هُم بَـٰرِزُونَۖ [سورة غافر 40:16 cited by شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/29]\nThe Day they come forth",

    "text": "25.11 A foreign element separating a governor from its governee\nA foreign element is one that is not directly governed by a governor. In most cases, a foreign element should not come between (and thus separate) a governor from its governee(s). For example, consider the following sentence:\n\nعَلِمْتُ مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي 66]\nI knew Muḥammad [to be] writing a book.\n\nIn the example above the verbal sentence يُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابًا is in place of the second direct doee of عَلِمْتُ. The noun كِتَابًا is governed directly by the verb يُؤَلِّفُ. So كِتَابًا is a foreign element for the verb عَلِمْتُ. Therefore, the following sentence is impermissible:\n\n✗ عَلِمْتُ كِتَابًا مُحَمَّدًا يُؤَلِّفُ [الجملة العربية لفاضل السامرائي 66]",

    "section": "25.12 The state-of-affairs pronoun",
    "text": "25.12 The state-of-affairs pronoun\nUsually, for pronouns, the pronoun’s referent is a single noun that occurs before it. For example, if we say\n\nزَيْدٌ هَوَ مُنْطَلِقٌ\nZayd is setting out.\n\nThen the pronoun هُوَ refers to the noun زَيْدٌ which occurs before it.\nThere is a special pronoun, called the state-of-affairs pronoun (ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ) that behaves differently from other pronouns It is used to begin compound nounal sentences. Here is an example of a sentence with a state-of-affairs pronoun:\n\nهُوَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [معاني النحو 1/57]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is setting out.\n\nThe pronoun هُوَ is the state-of-affairs pronoun It is the subject of the outer sentence. Its info is the inner sentence زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ. What the state-of-affairs pronoun is referring to is explained by the entire sentence زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ that occurs after it.\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is typically used for statements that are momentous. Consider, for example, a situation where one hears some hubbub, and wonders, “What is the state of affairs that is causing this hubbub?” The answer to this question is:\n\nهُوَ الأَمِيرُ مُقْبِلٌ [شرح الرضي على الكافية 2/464]\nIt is: the commander is approaching.\n(the pronoun “it” is referring to “the state of affairs”.)\n\nThis pronoun is often left untranslated. So example (58) may simply be translated as The commander is approaching.\nHere are some rules and guidelines regarding the state-of-affairs pronoun:\n\nThe gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun\nIf the subject of the following sentence is masculine, then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the masculine pronoun هُوَ. And if the subject of the following sentence is feminine, then the state-of-affairs pronoun is generally the feminine pronoun هِيَ. Examples:\n\nهُوَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.\nهِيَ هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.\n\nAs mentioned, the gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun generally matches the gender of the following subject (as above). Sometimes, however, it is found to mismatch. For example:\n\nهِيَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] is: Zayd is standing.\nهُوَ هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745–756]\n[The state of affairs] is: Hind is standing.\n\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a singular pronoun, regardless of whether the subject of the following subject is singular, dual, or plural.11\n\nهُوَ الزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ\n[The state of affairs] is: the two Zayds are standing.\nهِيَ الْهِنْدَاتُ قَائِمَاتٌ\n[The state of affairs] is: the Hinds are standing.\n\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun for the absentee person\nEven if the subject of the inner sentence is a pronoun for the speaker or adressee persons, the state-of-affairs pronoun is always a pronoun of for the absentee person. For example:\n\nهُوَ أَنَا زَيْدٌ [معاني النحو 1/59]\n[The fact] is: I am Zayd.\n\nThe sentence أَنَا أَنَا زَيْدٌ is possible, but in this case the pronoun أَنَا is not a state-of-affairs pronoun. Rather it is repeated for emphasis.12\n\n\nThe state-of-affairs pronouns هُوَ and هِيَ only introduce nounal sentences\nThe state-of-affairs pronouns هُوَ and هِيَ only introduce nounal sentences.13 This can be seen in the examples above.\nWe will see, in sections (kaana) and (inna), that the state-of-affairs pronoun can also be used with كَانَ and إِنَّ (and its sisters). In these cases, the state-of-affairs pronoun may introduce verbal sentences. For example:\n\nفَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعۡمَى ٱلۡأَبۡصَـٰرُ [سورة الحج 22:46 cited by شرح الرضي على الكافية 2/467]\nFor indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded",

The info of the outer sentence is the inner sentence يَقُومُ.\nInstead of using the stateful verb يَقُومُ, we can use its doer participle قَائِم, thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing\n\nAs you can see, we have translated the stateful verb يَقُومُ as stands and the doer participle قَائِم as standing. We will discuss the difference in meaning between the stateful verb and the doer participle in more detail in chapter (ref), if Allāh wills. For now, we will focus on the grammar of the two sentences.\nThere is one notable similarity between the grammar of examples (1) and (2), and one notable difference:\n\nThe similarity\nThe stateful verb يَقُومُ, and the doer participle قَائِمٌ both govern a latent doer pronoun, implicated as [هُوَ].\n\n\nThe difference\nThe stateful verb يَقُومُ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] are complementary structural elements that constitute a complete sentence. The latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is the structure-starter and the stateful verb يَقُومُ is the structure-completer. The sentence formed by the stateful verb يَقُومُ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the subject (زَيْدٌ) of the outer sentence.\nOn the other hand, and the doer participle قَائِمٌ and its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] are not complementary structural elements. Rather, قَائِمٌ (as the structure-completer) and زَيْدٌ (as the structure-starter) are complementary structural elements. This is a simple sentence, not a compound sentence. The latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] is not the structural element of any sentence. But, despite being dispensable from the perspective of sentence completion, the latent doer pronoun is an essential governee of the doer participle.\nLet’s take a look at another example:\n\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا قَائِمًا\nI saw a standing man.\n\nThe structural elements of this sentence are رَأَيْتُ: the verb رَأَى and its doer pronoun تُ. The entire phrase رَجُلًا قَائِمًا has only dispensable elements. قَائِمًا is a attribute of رَجُلًا, governed by the verb رَأَى. The doer participle قَائِمًا has a latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] that refers back to رَجُلًا. But because قَائِمًا is a (dispensable) element of an existing sentence (whose structural elements are رَأَيْتُ), therefore it cannot be the structural structure-completer of a new sentence with its latent doer pronoun [هُوَ].\nSo, as you can see, whenever the doer participle has a latent doer pronoun, that doer pronoun is not the structure-starter of any sentence. This is because the doer participle, as a single element, is already a member of an existing sentence.\nIn contrast, a verb always forms a sentence (as the structure-completer) with its doer (as the structure-starter). If we replace the doer participle قَائِمًا with the verb يَقُومُ thus:\n\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا يَقُومُ\n\nthen يَقُومُ is a complete sentence with the verb and its latent doer pronoun as structural elements. This complete sentence is the attribute of رَجُلًا.",

    "text": "26.3 The doer participle as the governor of a latent doer pronoun\nLet us look into the latent doer pronoun of the doer participle in more detail. It makes sense for a verb to have a doer but how can a noun have a doer? The reason is that the doer participle, because of its closeness to the verb, can act like one. When acting with verbal force, it can govern a doer. It can also, as we will see soon, if Allāh wills, govern a direct doee.\nThe doer of the doer participle is, by default, a latent pronoun. And it refers back to a referent that occurs before it. In example (2) زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ the doer of the doer participle قَائِمٌ is the latent pronoun [هُوَ]. And the referent of this doer pronoun is the subject زَيْدٌ.\nDIAGRAM\nLet’s see another example:\n\nصَاحَ الرَّجُلُ الْقَائِمُ\nThe standing man shouted.\n\nthen الْقَائِمُ governs a latent doer pronoun [هُوَ], that refers back to الرَّجُلُ.\nThe fact that the doer participle has a latent doer pronoun is, in fact, the reason why a doer participle in the info will match the subject in gender.1\nFor example, if we say:\n\nهِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ\nHind is standing.\n\nthen the feminine marker ة is added to the doer participle قَائِم only because it has to match the feminine gender of the latent doer pronoun [هِيَ] that occurs with, and is governed by, the doer participle. (The latent doer pronoun [هِيَ] refers back to هِنْد.)\nWhen the referent of the latent doer pronoun changes for number or gender, then the latent doer pronoun will change to match it. For example:\n\nالزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/291]\nThe two Zayds are standing.\nالزَّيْدُونَ قَائِمُونَ [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 1/291]\nThe Zayds are standing.\n\nIn example (7) above, the latent doer pronoun of قَائِمَانِ is implicated as هُمَا.\nAnd in example (8) the latent doer pronoun of قَائِمُونَ is implicated as هُمْ.\nAs a point of technicality, the alif in the dual suffix of قَائِمَانِ and the و in the plural suffix of قَائِمُونَ, are not themselves the doer pronouns.2 Rather, the doer pronouns for the doer participles above are latent.\nThis is different than for verbs. In the verbs يَقُومَانِ and يَقُومُونَ, the alif in انِ and the و in ونَ are, themselves, considered the doer pronouns. And these pronouns are overt, not latent.",

    "section": "26.4 The doer participle as the governor of a direct doee",
    "text": "26.4 The doer participle as the governor of a direct doee\nWe have seen that the doer participle, when acting with verbal force, governs a doer. In a similar manner, the doer participle for transitive verbs can, optionally, govern a direct doee. In order to introduce this behavior, we use again, as our starting point, the u-state stateful verb. Consider the following example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا\nZayd beats Amr\n\nExample (9) above is parsed as follows:\n\nزَيْدٌ is a subject.\nيَضْرِبُ is a stateful verb in the u-state. It governs a latent pronoun (implicated as هُوَ) in the u-state as its doer. The latent doer pronoun هُوَ refers back to its referent: the subject زَيْدٌ.\nعَمْرًا is a direct doee, governed in the a-state by the verb يَضْرِبُ.\nيَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا is an inner sentence which is in place of a u-state noun as the info of the subject زَيْدٌ.\n\nInstead of using the verb يَضْرِبُ in example (9) above we may instead use its doer participle ضَارِب, thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nExample (10) is parsed as follows:\n\nزَيْدٌ is a subject.\nضَارِبٌ is the info of the subject زَيْدٌ. It governs a latent pronoun (implicated as هُوَ) in the u-state as its doer. The latent doer pronoun هُوَ refers back to the subject زَيْدٌ.\nعَمْرًا is a direct doee, governed in the a-state by the doer participle ضَارِبٌ.\n\nAs you can see, the doer participle ضَارِبٌ can govern a direct doee just like the verb يَضْرِبُ.\nHowever, while a transitive verb can govern a direct doee unconditionally, a doer participle can only govern a direct doee if certain conditions are satisfied. We will discuss these conditions in section (ref) below.\nBy the way, we again highlight the difference in the doer of the verb يَضْرِبُ vs the doer of the doer participle ضَارِبٌ: The verb يَضْرِبُ and its doer are complementary structural pairs that constitute a complete sentence. Whereas, the doer participle ضَارِبٌ does not form a new sentence with its doer.\n\n26.4.1 A doer participle defined by ٱل as the governor of a direct doee\nExample (10) shows the government of a direct doee by an doer participle that is not defined by ٱل. In a similar manner, an doer participle that is defined by ٱل, can also govern a direct doee. For example:\n\nهَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/84]\nThis [person] is the beater of Zayd.\n\nBy the way, you my be wondering what is the difference between the sentence in example (11) هَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا above, and if we had used an annexation thus:\n\nهَذَا ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ This [person] is the beater of Zayd.\n\nThis is touched upon in section (ma3aani_ism_faa3il).\n\n\n26.4.2 Word order of the direct doee and its governing doer participle\nAs with verbs, the direct doee usually follows its governing doer participle (as in the examples above). But when an doer participle is not prefixed by ال, then its direct doee is allowed to precede it. So we can say:\n\nهذا زيدا ضارب [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/259]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd.\n\nWhile the direct doee is permitted to precede its governing doer participle (as above), it is very common, in such a case, for a strengthening-لِ to be used with an indirect doee instead, thus:\n\nهذا لِزيدٍ ضارب\nThis [person], to Zayd, is beating.\nلِلضَّيْفِ مُكْرِمٌ [Fischer 113]\nto the guest, is honoring\n(i.e. honoring the guest)\n\nThe strengthening-لِ is discussed in more detail in section (later chapter).3\nAlso, the freedom for the governee of a doer participle to precede it is only given to the doer participle not prefixed by ال. When an doer participle is prefixed by ال, then its direct doee is not allowed to precede it.4 So we cannot say:\n\n✗ هذا زيدا الضارب\n\nWe would have to say instead\n\n✓ هذا الضارب زيدا\n\nTODO: Fronting the direct doee is not permitted for participle-like adjective. See link in example above. Add to section on participle-like adjective\n\n\n26.4.3 A dual or plural doer participle as the governor of a direct doee\nA dual or plural doer participle may govern a direct doee just like the singular. So we can say:\n\nهذان ضاربان زيدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThese two [persons] are beating Zayd.\nهم ضاربون زيدًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThese [persons] are beating Zayd.\nالهندات ضاربات عمرا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\n\nDoer participles defined by ٱل are again also permitted:\n\nهذان الضاربان زيدا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nThese two are the beaters of Zayd.\nهؤلاء الضاربون الرجل [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nThese are the beaters of the man.\nوَٱلۡمُقِیمِینَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَۚ وَٱلۡمُؤۡتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ [سورة النساء 4:162 cited by شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/40]\nAnd the establishers of prayer [especially] and the givers of zakāh\n\nFor plurals, the sound plurals are more worthy of being used as verb-like governors5 as in the examples above. However, broken plurals are permitted as well. So we can say:\n\nالزيدون ضُرّابٌ عمرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهِنْداتُ ضواربُ عَمْرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\n\nFlexible word order is again permitted for the dual and the plural as it was for the singular:\n\nالزيدان عمرا ضاربان [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe two Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالزيدون عَمْرًا ضُرّابٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Zayds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهندات عمرا ضاربات [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 1/439]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.\nالهِنْداتُ عَمْرًا ضواربُ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/97]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr.",

    "section": "26.5 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee",
    "text": "26.5 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee\nAs we mentioned above, there are conditions that must be satisfied in order for an doer participle to be able to govern a direct doee in this manner. The conditions are different for when the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ, and when it is not defined by ٱلْ. We will discuss each of these cases separately below:\n\n26.5.1 When the doer participle is not defined by ٱلْ\nWhen the doer participle is not defined by ٱلْ, then two conditions must be satisfied:\n\nThe verbal aspect of the doer participle must be imperfect. That is, it must indicate an ongoing (whether present or past) or future action. Examples:\n\npresent ongoing:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا الآن [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd now.\n\npast ongoing:\n\nكان زيد ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd was beating Ɛamr.\nوَكَلْبُهُمْ بَاسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بَٱلْوَصِيدِ [سورة الكهف 18:18 cited by شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nwhile their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance\n\nfuture:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا غَدًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] will beat Zayd tomorrow.\n\n\nIf the verbal aspect indicated by the doer participle is perfect, then the doer participle may not govern a direct doee. So, for example, we cannot say:\n\n✗ هذا ضارب زيدا أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] beat Zayd yesterday.\n\nIf we desire to use the doer participle, then it will not have verbal force. And زَيْد will have to be a base noun in a annexation. Furthermore, this annexation will be real (see chapter (ref)).\n\nهذا ضارب زيد أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.\n\nAn exception is made for for transitive verbs that take more than one direct doee, like جعل, أَعطى, etc. When the doer participle of such a verb is annexed to what would have been the first direct doee, then second direct doee is permitted to be in the a-state, even if the aspect is perfect.6 For example:\n\nهذا معطي زيد أمس درهما [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/78]\nThis [person] was the giver of Zayd, yesterday, a dirham.\n\nEven the first direct doee may remain in the a-state, if separated from the doer participle. For example:\n\nهذا ظان أمس زيدا فاضلا [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/78]\nThis [person] was the believer, yesterday, of Zayd as an eminent person.\n\nThe second condition that should be satisfied is that the doer participle must have governing support. This governing support can be provided by the following means:\n\nThe doer participle occurs after a question word. Example:\n\nأضارب زيد عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nIs Zayd beating Ɛamr?\nهَلْ مُكْرِمٌ أَنْتَ زَيْدًا [Wright 2/65D]\nWill you be treating Zayd with respect?\n\nThe doer participle occurs after a vocative particle: Example:\n\nيا طالعا جبلا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nO scaler [of] a mountain!\n\nThe doer participle occurs in a negation: Example:\n\nما ضارب زيد عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd is not beating Ɛamr.\nمَا أَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ [سورة البقرة 2:145 cited by Wright 2/65D]\nNor will you be a follower of their qiblah\nمَا مُجِيرٌ أَحَدٌ عَدُوَّ أَحِبَّاءِهِ [Wright 2/65D]\nNo one gives protection to the enemy of his loved ones\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a attribute. Example:\n\nمررت برجل ضارب زيدا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI passed by a man beating Zayd.\nمَرَرْتُ بِفَارِسٍ طَالِبٍ ثَأْرَ أَبِيهِ [Wright 2/65C]\nI passed by a horseman (who was) seeking vengeance for (the murder of) his father\n\nAn implied attribute is also considered permissible. Example:\n\nكَمْ مَالِئٍ عَيْنَيْهِ مِنْ شَيْءِ غَيْرِهِ [Wright 2/65C; شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/108]\nHow many a one fills his eyes with a thing of [someone] other than him\n(i.e. كَمْ شَخْصٍ مَالِئٍ How many a person fills…)\nكَنَاطِحٍ صَخْرَةً يَوْمًا لِيُوهِنَهَا [Wright 2/65C; شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/109]\nLike the gorer of a rock, one day, to try to weaken it\n(i.e. كَوَعِلٍ نَاطِحٍ like a goring mountain goat…)\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a ḥāl. Example:\n\nجاء زيد راكبا فرسا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd came riding a horse.\n\nThe doer participle occurs as a info. Example:\n\nزيد ضارب عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd is beating Ɛamr.\n\nWe will learn in later chapters, if Allāh wills, different forms of infos. The following examples show these different forms, with references to the later chapters.\n\nكان زيد ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nZayd was beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (kaana).)\nإن زيدا ضارب عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nIndeed Zayd is beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (inna).)\nظننت زيدا ضاربا عمرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI thought Zayd [was] beating Ɛamr.\n(See chapter (zanna).)\nأعلمت زيدا عمرا ضاربا بكرا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/107]\nI let Zayd know Ɛamr is beating Bakr.\n(See chapter (zanna).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.2 When the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ\nWhen the doer participle is defined by ٱلْ, then it is permitted to govern a direct doee for a perfect or imperfect aspect.  Furthermore, no governing support is required for it to be a governor,7 (as was required for the doer participle without ٱلْ in section (ref) above).\nSo we can say:\n\nجاء الضارب زيداً أمسِ أو الآن أو غداً [شرح شذور الذهب للجوجري 2/683]\nThe beater of Zayd came yesterday/today/tomorrow",

    "text": "26.6 The doer participle as the governor of an overt doer pronoun\nThe latent doer pronoun becomes overt in some circumstances. In this section, we will discuss one such circumstance. Consider the sentence:\n\nالفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه [النحو الوافي 1/463]\n\nThis grammar is parsed as follows:\n\nالْفَارِسُ is the subject of the outer sentence.\nالْحِصَانُ is a second subject. It is the subject of the inner sentence.\nمُتْبِع is the info of the inner sentence. It is also a annexe noun.\nThe pronoun هُ is a base noun.\nThe inner sentence الْحِصَانُ مُتْبِعُهُ is the info of the subject (الْفَارِسُ) of outer sentence.\n\nThe info of the inner sentence مُتْبِع one who makes tired has a latent doer pronoun, implicated as [هُوَ]. It is possible for this latent doer pronoun to refer to either الْفَارِسُ or الْحِصَانُ. Let’s discuss both these meanings:\n\nIf the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] in مُتْبِع refers to الْحِصَانُ then the meaning is that the horse makes the horseman tired. In this case, the pronoun هُ in مُتْبِعُهُ refers to الْفَارِسُ.\nAnd if the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] in مُتْبِع refers to الْفَارِسُ then the meaning is that the horseman makes the horse tired. In this case, the pronoun هُ in مُتْبِعُهُ refers to الْحِصَانُ.\n\nBoth meanings are possible.\nIf only the second meaning is desired, then the latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] can be made overt and added after the doer participle مُتْبِع, thus:\n\nالفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه هُوَ [النحو الوافي 1/464]\nThe horseman – the horse – [he] makes him tired.\n(i.e. The horseman makes the horse tired.)\n\nNow only the second meaning is possible. If the first meaning is desired, the doer pronoun of مُتْبِع must stay latent and the ambiguity will remain.\nBy the way, the ambiguity arose in the original sentence (الفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه) only because both subjects (الْفَارِسُ and الْحِصَانُ) are singular masculine nouns. If the two subjects are distinguishable in number or gender then there will be no ambiguity. However, even in this case, according to some grammarians, if the info is to refer to the subject of the outer sentence, then the doer pronoun of the doer participle in the info should be made overt. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا هُوَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/207]\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)\n\nBut according to other grammarians, because ضَارِب can refer only to Zayd and not to Hind, the doer participle’s doer pronoun can remain latent,8 thus:\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)",

    "section": "26.7 The sababi info",
    "text": "26.7 The sababi info\n\nConsider again example (9) زَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا. From this original sentence, we replaced the verb يَضْرِبُ with its doer participle and came up with (10) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا.\nNow consider the following example:\n\nزَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا\nZayd – his father beats Ɛamr\n\nIn example (58) above the doer of يَضْرِبُ is not Zayd but Zayd’s father. If we use this sentence as our starting point, we can again replace the verb يَضْرِبُ with its doer participle ضَارِبٌ and say:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا\nZayd – his father is beating Ɛamr\n\nأَبُوهُ is the (overt) doer of the doer participle ضَارِبٌ. And عَمْرًا is its direct doee. So just like a verb can have an overt noun as its doer instead of a latent pronoun, so too can the doer participle have an overt noun as its doer instead of a latent pronoun.\nAgain, there is one important difference between using the verb يَضْرِبُ vs using its doer participle ضَارِبٌ. And that is that يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا in example (58) is a complete sentence. This inner sentence is the info of the outer sentence. Therefore, example (58) is a compound sentence.\nHowever, ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا in example (59) is not a complete sentence. ضَارِبٌ itself, as a single word, is the info of the subject زَيْدٌ.9 So example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا is not a compound sentence.\n\nThe info ضَارِبٌ in example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا is called a sababi info.10 A deverbal noun is termed sababi when it governs a doer which is annexed to a pronoun that refers back to the original referent of the deverbal noun.11 In our example, the deverbal noun ضَارِبٌ governs a doer أَب which is annexed to a pronoun هُ that refers back to the original referent of the deverbal noun, the subject زَيْد.\n\n\n26.7.1 Varying the number or gender of the overt doer of the sababi info\nHere is another example of a sentence with a sababi info:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبُوهُ [Peled, Sentence types 208]\nZayd – his father was setting out.\n\nIn example (60) above, مُنْطَلِقًا is the sababi info of كَانَ. The overt doer of the مُنْطَلِقًا is the singular masculine noun أَبُوه his father.\nLet’s see what happens when we vary the number or gender of this overt doer of the sababi info.\n\nكَانَ الزَيْدَانِ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبَوَاهُمَا [Peled, Sentence types 208]\nThe two Zayds – their fathers were setting out.\n\nIn example (61) above, the sababi info مُنْطَلِقًا remains in the singular, even though its doer is the dual أَبَوَاهُمَا.\nThis is analagous to a verb, which remains in the singular for dual and plural doers. For example كَانَ الزَيْدَانِ يَنْطَلِقُ أَبَوَاهُمَا, etc.\nIf the gender of the doer participle’s doer is feminine, then the doer participle remains in the singular but it is feminized. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةٌ أُمُّهُ\nZayd – his mother is setting out.\nكَانَتْ هِنْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةً خَالَتَاهَا\nHind – her two maternal aunts were setting out.\n\nThis again is analagous to the feminizing a verb that has a feminine doer.\nIf the doer of the doer participle is a plural, then we have an choice:\nIf the doer participle has a sound plural, then, again, it is not used and the doer participle remains in the singular. For example:\n\nكَانَ الزَيْدُونَ مُنْطَلِقًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nThe Zayds – their fathers were setting out.\nزَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقَةٌ خَالَاتُهُ\nZayd – his maternal aunts are setting out.\n\nBut if the doer participle has a broken plural, then it is allowed to be used, and is indeed preferred,12 when the doer is a plural.\nFor example:\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ قِيَامًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nThe Zayds – their fathers were standing\n\nHere are some examples of sababi infos from the Qurʾān:\n\nفَإِنَّهُۥۤ ءَاثِمࣱ قَلۡبُهُۥۗ [سورة البقرة 2:283]\nhis heart is indeed sinful\n(Other analyses besides a sababi info are also possible.13 One such differing analysis is discussed in section (ref) below.)\nوَظَنُّوۤا۟ أَنَّهُم مَّانِعَتُهُمۡ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ [سورة الحشر 59:2]\nand they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh\n(Another analysis is also possible: حُصُونُهُمْ can be a subject, and مَانِعَتُهُمْ is its fronted info.14)\n\n\n\n26.7.2 Word order of the doer and the direct doee in a sababi info\nIf the doer participle is transitive, then the normal word order is doer participle, doer, direct doee. For example:\n\nهَذَا ضَارب أَبوهُ زيدا [الهمع للسيوطي 3/89]\nThis [person] – his father is beating Zayd.\n\nBut the direct doee can be made to precede the doer thus:\n\nهذا ضارب زيدا أبوه [حاشية الصبان على شرح الأشمونى لألفية ابن مالك 2/453]\nThis [person] – his father is beating Zayd.",

    "text": "26.8 The sababi attribute\nIn section (ref) above we have seen how a doer participle can govern a overt doer when it is a sababi info. In a similar manner, a doer participle can govern a overt doer when it is a sababi attribute.\nConsider the following example:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَبُوهُ\nI passed by a man whose father is setting out\n\nThe doer participle مُنْطَلِقٍ is a attribute of the attributee رَجُلٍ. Because it is a sababi attribute, it has a doer أَب that is annexed to a pronoun هُ which refers to the attributee رَجُلٍ.\nWe know that, in general, a attribute will match its attributee in four aspects:\n\nstate\ndefiniteness\ngender\nnumber (singular/dual/plural)\n\nThe sababi attribute will also match its preceding attributee in state and definiteness. (You can see the attribute مُنْطَلِقٍ matches its attributee رَجُلٍ in the i-state and in being indefinite.) But in matching gender and number the sababi attribute has different rules. Consistent with we learned for the sababi info above, the sababi attribute will, in general, always be singular, and it will match its doer in gender. Here are some examples that show different combinations:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِالرَّجُلِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَبُوهُ\nI passed by the man whose father is setting out.\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَخَوَاهُ\nI passed by a man whose two brothers are setting out.\nرَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا مُنْطَلِقًا آبَاؤُهُمْ\nI saw men whose fathers are setting out.\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْطَلِقَةً أُمُّهُ\nI saw a man whose mother is setting out.\nجَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ الْمُنْطَلِقَةُ أَخَوَاتُهُ\nZayd whose sisters are setting out came to me.\nجَاءَتْنِي امْرَأَةٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهَا\nA woman whose father is setting out came to me.\nمَرَرْتُ بِالْمَرْأَةِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَخَوَاهَا\nI passed by the woman whose two brothers are setting out.\n\nThe above examples use the doer participle مُنْطَلِق which only has sound plurals. Therefore it remains in the singular. If an doer participle has a broken plural, it is permitted (and in fact preferred) to use the broken plural for a plural doer.15 Examples:\n\nمَرَرْت بِرِجَال قيام آباؤهم [شرح قطر الندى وبل الصدى 288]\nI passed by men whose fathers are standing.\nمَرَرْت برجل قعُود غلمانه [شرح قطر الندى وبل الصدى 288]\nI passed by a man whose slave-boys are sitting\n(Note that the attributee رَجُل is singular in this case.)\n\nSome more aspects of gender agreement of the sababi doer with its governing deverbal noun will be discussed in section (sifah_mush sababi na3t), if Allāh wills.",

    "section": "26.10 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer",
    "text": "26.10 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer\nIn section (ref) above, we discussed the conditions for the doer participle to govern a direct doee. Correspondingly, there exist conditions for the doer participle to govern a doer.\nThe doer participle can have either an overt doer (either as a noun or as a pronoun), or a latent doer pronoun. We will treat each of these separately below:\n\n26.10.1 Conditions for the doer participle to govern an overt doer\nThe grammarians differed with regard to the conditions under which the doer participle is allowed to govern an overt doer. According to some, the same conditions are applicable as for governing a direct doee, namely that when an doer participle is not defined by ٱل, then it can only govern an overt doer when\n\nIt has an imperfect aspect.\nIt has governing support\n\nSo it is not allowed to govern an overt doer for a perfect aspect. The following example would then be disallowed:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ أَمْسِ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 134]\nZayd – his father stood yesterday.\n\nOther grammarians, however, allowed such a sentence.16\nwhen an doer participle is defined by ٱل, then it can only govern an overt doer unconditionally. So it can govern with perfective aspect and without governing support. Examples:\n\nجاءني القائم أبوه [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 1/449]\nThe one whose father is standing came.\nالقائم أبوه ضاحك [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 3/257]\nThe one whose father is standing is laughing.\nجاء الضارب أبوه زيدًا أمس [شرح ابن الناظم على ألفية ابن مالك 59]\nThe one whose father beat Zayd yesterday came.\n\n\n\n26.10.2 Conditions for the doer participle to govern a latent doer pronoun\nAs a default, the doer participle requires a latent doer pronoun. So it governs a latent doer pronoun unconditionally, except when it is prevented from doing so because of one of the following situations:\n\nThe doer participle is already governing an overt doer noun\nIf the doer participle is already governing an overt doer, then it will not also have a latent doer pronoun. This is because one doer participle cannot have two doers.17 Example:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 139]\nZayd – his father is standing\n\nBeware though, that sometimes it may appear that an doer participle is governing an overt doer, but actually another interpretation may also be possible. Consider the following āyah that we discussed in section (ref) above:\n\nفَإِنَّهُۥۤ ءَاثِمࣱ قَلۡبُهُۥۗ [سورة البقرة 2:283]\nhis heart is indeed sinful\n\nWe had discussed this as a case of a sababi info. But another analysis is also possible: The doer participle آثِمٌ is governing a latent doer pronoun, and قَلْبُهُ is a sub for the latent doer pronoun.18\n\n\nThe doer participle is already governing an overt doer pronoun\nWe discussed in section (ref) above, a situation in which the originally latent doer pronoun of a doer participle becomes overt. Because the doer is now overt the doer participle will not govern an additional latent doer.19\n\nزَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا هُوَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/207]\nZayd – Hind – [he] is beating her.\n(i.e. Zayd is beating Hind.)\n\n\n\nThe doer participle is the annexe noun in a real annexation\nWhen doer participle is the annexe noun in a real annexation, then it will not govern a latent doer pronoun.20 This can happen when the doer participle indicates a perfective aspect. We saw an example of this in the conditions for governing a direct doee above:\n\nهذا ضارب زيد أمس [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/106]\nThis [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.\n\nBy the way, this does not mean that the doer participle cannot govern a latent doer pronoun whenever it signifies a perfective aspect. It only cannot do so in a real annexation. So doer participle will govern a latent doer pronoun when it has a perfective aspect, but no annexation. For example:\n\nهذا ضاربٌ أمس\nThis [person] was a beater yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun\nWhen the doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun (see section (ref) below), then, in general, it does not govern a latent doer pronoun.21. For example:\n\n\nزَيْدٌ صَاحِبٌ\nZayd is a companion\n\nBut even for entity nouns, the the latent doer pronoun can re-emerge when needed (see section (sec-the-doer-participle-crossover-to-substantive-as-a-attribute)).",

    "section": "26.11 Superficial annexation",
    "text": "26.11 Superficial annexation\n\nSuperficial annexation used to eliminate tanwīn\nConsider again the sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا\nzaydun ḍāribun 3amran\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nThe doer participle ضَارِبٌ has a tanwīn which is pronounced before pronouncing the direct doee عَمْرًا. In an effort to make the pronunciation easier, this tanwīn is often eliminated and replaced with an annexation. The direct doee is then made into a base noun in the i-state. The meaning remains the same. So the above sentence then becomes:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو\nzaydun ḍāribu 3amrin\nZayd is beating Amr\n\nThis is called a superficial annexation, as opposed to a real annexation, which is what we have been studying so far. This is because it is only an annexation for the purposes of easing the pronunciation, not in meaning.\nRegarding terminology, عَمْرٍو syntactically becomes a base noun in the superficial annexation. But in meaning, it is still the direct doee of the doer participle ضَارِب. We will refer to it as the semantic direct doee.\nBy the way, the sentence زَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو can also be a real annexation. In which case, the meaning will be: Zayd is the beater of Ɛamr. So if we come across such a sentence, how can we tell if it is a real annexation or a superficial annexation? The answer is, in this case, context should guide us. We will see below that the superficial annexation is not always identical in form to the real annexation. So in those cases, the form of the annexation will tell us whether it is a real annexation or a superficial annexation.\nHere are some more examples of a superficial annexation used to eliminate a tanwīn:\n\nالْهِنْدَاتُ ضارباتُ عمرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضارباتٌ عمرًا)\n\nWhen the doer participle is a semi-flexible, it will not have a tanwīn. But the superficial annexation may still be used in such a case because a tanwīn would have been present if the word were fully-flexible.22 For example:\n\nالْهِنْدَاتُ ضواربُ عَمْرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe Hinds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضواربُ عمرًا)\n\n\n\nSuperficial annexation used to eliminate the ن of a dual or plural suffix\nThe superficial annexation is used in situations when the governing doer participle has tanwīn (as above), and also in situations when it ends with a ن arising from a dual or sound plural. Examples:\n\nالزَّيْدَانِ ضاربا عَمْرٍو [modified from شرح التصريح على التوضيح 1/682]\nThe [two] Zayds are beating Ɛamr\n(instead of ضاربانِ عَمْرًا)\n\n\n\nDefiniteness of the superficial annexation\nBecause this is a superficial and not a real annexation, the annexe noun is not made definite by a definite base noun. In the examples so far, the base nouns have been proper nouns (زَيْد, عَمْرو) which are definite. But the doer participles (ضَارِب, ضَارِبَا, etc.) remain indefinite, because they did not originally have ٱل when governing a direct doee. This example proves the above claim:\n\nهَدۡیَۢا بَـٰلِغَ ٱلۡكَعۡبَةِ [سورة المائدة 5:95 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/84]\nas an offering [to Allāh] delivered to the Kaʿbah\n\nIn example (93) above, the doer participle بَالِغ is a annexe noun to the definite base noun الْكَعْبَة. But this is a superficial annexation. So بَالِغ does not become definite. Therefore بَالِغ can be a attribute to the indefinite هَدْيًا.\nIf the doer participle is to be made definite in a superficial annexation then a ٱل is added to it. For example:\n\nهذان الضاربا زيدٍ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nThese two are the beaters of Zayd.\n(instead of هذان الضاربان زيدًا)\nوَٱلۡمُقِیمِی ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ [سورة الحج 22:35 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nand the establishers of prayer\n\nAdding ٱل to the annexe noun is particular to a superficial annexation. As we know, it is not permitted in a real annexation. So when we see ٱل with a annexe noun, then we will know that the annexation has to be a superficial one.\n\n\nWhen the doer participle does not have tanwīn or a suffixed ن\nConsider the following case of a doer participle governing a direct doee:\n\nالضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا\nthe beater of Zayd\n\nThere is no tanwīn of suffixed ن after the doer participle. Therefore, a superficial annexation is not permitted, and we cannot say:\n\n✗ الضَّارِبُ زَيْدٍ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\n\nThe following are similarly not permitted:\n\n✗ الضارب رجلٍ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beater of the man\n✗ الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/66B] the beater of the slave of Zayd\n✗ الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِهِ [Wright 2/66B] the beater of his slave\n\nIf, however, the direct doee is defined by ٱل, or is itself a annexe noun to a base noun that is defined by ٱل, then, as an exception, the superficial annexation is again permitted.23 For example:\n\nالضَّارِبُ الْعَبْدِ [Wright 2/66A]\nthe beater of the slave\nالضَّارِبُ رَأْسِ الْعَبْدِ [Wright 2/66A]\nthe beater of the head of the slave\n\n\n\nالضَّارِبُ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\nthe beater of the man\nالضَّوَارِبُ/الضُّرَّابُ/الضَّارِبَاتُ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beaters of the man\nالضَّوَارِبُ/الضُّرَّابُ/الضَّارِبَاتُ غُلَامِ الرَّجُلِ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/47]\nthe beaters of the slave-boy of the man\n\n\n\nTwo or more direct doees connected by وَ or أَوْ\nWhen a doer participle governs two or more direct doees connected by وَ or أَوْ then, if the first is in a superficial annexation then the second may either be in the i-state or the a-state. For example\n\nهذا ضاربُ زيدٍ وعمرٍو/وعمرًا [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/81]\nThis [person] is beating Zayd and Ɛamr\n\nBy the way, if the first direct doee is in the a-state, then it is not an annexation and the second direct doee would follow in the a-state.\n\nهذا ضاربٌ زيدًا وعمرًا\nThis [person] is beating Zayd and Ɛamr\n\n\n\nSuperficial annexation with a overt doer\nConsider an doer participle that has a overt doer and is governing a direct doee thus:\n\n\nمررت برجل ضارب أبوه زيدا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/458]\nI passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.\n\nIf we wish to use a superficial annexation, then the doer participle can only be annexed to its direct doee and not to its doer. So we can say:\n\nمررت برجل ضارب زيد أبوه [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 2/74]\nI passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.\n(Remember from section (ref) above that the word order ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا أَبُوهُ is permissible.)\n\nWe cannot say:\n\n✗ مررت برجل ضارب أَبِيهِ زيدا [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 10/359]",

This would permit words like: ضَارِبُنِي, الضَّارِبُونِي, etc. For example:\n\nفَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ صَادِقُونِي فِيهِ 24 [https://hadithunlocked.com/nasai-kubra:11291]\nSo will you tell me the truth about it?\n\nIt seems that this usage did not make its way to Standard Classical Arabic. But some grammarians permit this usage by poetic license, or as a rare usage.25",

    "section": "26.15 The doer of a deverbal noun that fulfils the role of the info",
    "text": "26.15 The doer of a deverbal noun that fulfils the role of the info\nIn our discussion of the doer of deverbal nouns, we have consistently stated that the doer of a deverbal noun is not a structural element. This is because the deverbal noun, which has a doer, is typically already part of an existing sentence. See example (59) زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا above.\nHowever, there is one special kind of sentence where that the doer of a deverbal noun is a structural element.\nBefore presenting this special doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentence, we will first give some background. Consider the sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nIn example (127) above, زَيْدٌ is the subject and قَائِمٌ is its info.\nWe can rearrange the word order to front the info thus:\n\nقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ\nStanding, Zayd is.\n\nThis fronted info will be common in negative and question sentences. For example:\n\nأَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/257B]\nIs Zayd standing?\nمَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ [Wright 2/257B]\nHind is not going\n\nNow we come to the special doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentence:\nIn negative and question sentences like examples (129) and (129) above, the deverbal noun can be analyzed as a subject, and its following doer will fulfil the role of the info.\nSo, in examples (129) and (129) above, قَائِمٌ can be considered a subject زَيْدٌ and can be its doer that fulfils the role of the info. Now, you might be thinking: what is the reason for this strange doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis?\nWhy can’t we just consider قَائِمٌ a fronted info and زَيْدٌ the backed subject?\nThe answer is that we can indeed consider قَائِمٌ a fronted info and زَيْدٌ the backed subject as one option. But, as another option, the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis allows us to keep the deverbal noun in the singular for dual and plural subjects. So we can say:\n\nأَقَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ\nAre the two Zayds standing?\nمَا ذَاهِبَةٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are not going\n\nSentences (131) and (132) are legitimate, but are only permitted for negative and question sentences.26 If it is not a negative or question sentence, then the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info construction is not permitted. So the following are not correct as complete sentences:\n\n✗ قَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ\nThe two Zayds are standing.\n✗ ذَاهِبَةٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are going\n\nThis is because the deverbal noun قَائِم cannot govern the overt doers الزَّيْدَانِ and الْهِنْدَاتُ without the governing support that is provided by being in a negative or question sentence.\nSo when it is not a negative or question sentence, then only the fronted info construction is permitted and the info will typically match the backed subject in number and gender. For example:\n\nقَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ\nStanding, the two Zayds are.\nذَاهِبَاتٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nGoing, the Hinds are.\n\nThe fronted info construction is also permitted, as an option, even for negative and question sentences. For example:\n\nأَقَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ\nAre the two Zayds standing?\nمَا ذَاهِبَاتٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ\nThe Hinds are not going\n\nWhen the deverbal noun and the doer are both singular, and it is a negative or question sentence, then a double analysis is possible27:\n\nthe fronted info analysis\nthe doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis\n\nSuch is the case in examples (129) أَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ and (130) مَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ above.\nHere are some more examples of doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info sentences:\n\nهَلْ مَضْرُوبٌ بَنُوكَ [Wright 2/257C]\nAre your sons beaten?\n(بَنُو is a deputy doer.)\nأَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنۡ ءَالِهَتِی یَـٰۤإِبۡرَ ٰ⁠هِیمُۖ [سورة مريم 19:46 cited by Wright 2/257D]\nHave you no desire for my gods, O Abraham?\n(A double analysis is reportedly possible, but the doer-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-info analysis is preferred.28)\nخَلِيلَيَّ مَا وَافٍ بِعَهْدِي أَنْتُمَا [Wright 2/257D]\nMy two friends, you are not keeping my promise.\nأَمُنْجِزٌ أَنْتُمْ وَعْدًا وَثِقْتُ بِهِ [Wright 2/257D]\nAre you fulfiling a promise that I put my trust on?",

    "text": "27.1 Introduction\nConsider the example:\nThe noun ذَهَاب going is the maṣdar of the verb ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ to go.\nLike the verb ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ, the maṣdar ذَهَاب signifies the action of going. But unlike the verb, the maṣdar does not include tense. So it doesn’t say when the action of going happened or will happen.\nThe maṣdar is classified as a primitive noun, not a deverbal noun. In other words, in terms of grammatical theory, it is not considered to be derived from the verb. (Rather, the verb is considered to be derived from the maṣdar.)\nAlso the maṣdar is not a adjectival noun. Technically, this would put it in the category of entity nouns. But because the maṣdar signifies the action of a verb, and not an actual entity, it is an abstract entity noun, not a concrete entity noun. In fact, we will treat it in a category of its own. We will see, if Allāh wills, that the maṣdar can cross over to a concrete entity noun and then refer to an entity.",

    "section": "27.2 The maṣdar as a verb-like governor in an annexation",
    "text": "27.2 The maṣdar as a verb-like governor in an annexation\nAs a noun which is related to a verb, a maṣdar can govern in a verb-like manner. Let’s start with a sentence which has a verb:\n\nيسرني أن تأتي \n\nأَنْ in the above example is that maṣdari أَنْ. This means that, as we learned in chapter (ref), it and its following verb can be interpreted as a maṣdar construction, thus:\n\n\nيسرني إتيانك\n\nWe also learned that this interpretation of the maṣdari أَنْ clause in example () above allows us to grammatically model the أَنْ clause as one structural element. In example () above the maṣdar construction إتيانك is modeled as the doer of the verb يسر.\n\nBut example () is also a legitimate sentence in its own right. The maṣdar إتيان signifies the occurrence of the verb أتى يأتي. But unlike the verb, it does not indicate tense. If we had started with a perfect verb, for example:\n\nيسرني أن أتيت\n\nthen it would have the same modeled maṣdar:\n\nيسرني إتيانك\n\nIn order to add tense to sentence with maṣdar, we would have to use other means, for example, an adverb:\n\nيسرني إتيانك غدا\nيسرني إتيانك أمس\n\nIn example () above, the maṣdar إتيان is a annexe noun in an annexation. Syntactically, the pronoun ك is in the i-state as the base noun in the annexation, but semantically, it is considered the doer of the. maṣdar إتيان.\nIn example () above the verb تأتي was used without a direct doee. Let’s see what happens when we add a direct doee. For example:\n\nيسرني أن تأتيني\n\nIn example () above, the pronoun ي me is the direct doee of the verb تأتي. If we model the أَنْ clause in example () above as a maṣdar construction, then we will get:\n\nيسرني إتيانك إِيَّايَ\n\nNow, the pronoun ك your is again the syntactic base noun and the semantic doer of the maṣdar إتيان. But the maṣdar now also has a direct doee إِيَايَ in the a-state.\n\nThe maṣdar in an annexation governing a u-state doer\nHere is another example of a maṣdar governing a semantic doer and a direct doee:\n\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ شُرْبِ زَيْدٍ الْعَسَلَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/102]\n\nBut this is not the only word order which is possible. We can flip the order of the doer and the direct doee, thus:\n\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ شُرْبِ الْعَسَلِ زَيْدٌ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/102]\n\nNow the semantic direct doee العسل is the base noun in the i-state and the doer زيد is in the u-state.\nThis word order of the direct doee’s being the base noun and the doer occurring after it in the u-state (شُرْبِ الْعَسَلِ زَيْدٌ) is not as usual as the usual word order (شُرْبِ الْعَسَلِ زَيْدٌ).1 Nevertheless, it is common enough.2\n\n\nThe maṣdar in an annexation governing only a direct doee without a doer\nThe doer of the maṣdar need not be mentioned. In this case, the maṣdar is a annexe noun noun to its sementic direct doee directly. For example:\n\nمَنَعَهُمْ مِنْ قَوْلِ الْحَقِّ [Wright 2/57C]\nHe hindered them from saying the truth.\n\nSometimes, context would be needed to tell whether the base noun is the semantic doer or the sementic direct doee. For example:\n\nعجبت من ضرب زيد [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 11/70]\n\nIn example () above, زيد may either have been the person who did the beating or the person who was beaten.3 Context would be needed to disambiguate.\n\n\nThe maṣdar governing a deputy doer\nJust like the maṣdar can govern a doer in the u-state it can similarly govern a deputy doer. For example:\n\nسَرَّنِي إِعْطَاءُ الدَّنَانِيرِ الْفَقِيرُ [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/109]\nThe giving of the dīnārs to the poor-one made me happy.\n\n\n\nThe maṣdar governing multiple direct doees\nThe maṣdar can govern multiple direct doees just like its verb. For example:\n\nعَرَفْتُ إِعْطَاءَكَ الْفَقِيرَ دِرْهَمًا [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/109]\nعَرَفْتُ إِعْلَامَكَ خَالِدًا جَعْفَرًا مُقِيمًا [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/109]\n\n\n\n27.2.0.1 The maṣdar in a annexation to an adverb of time/place\nThe adverb of time/place, like a ;mafulb, is considered a doee. As such, it can be a base noun to a governing maṣdar. Any doer and/or direct doees will then occur after it in their respective syntactic states. For example:\n\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ ضَرْبِ اليَوْمِ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/103]\nI wondered at today’s beating [by] Zayd [to] Ɛamr\n\n\n\nA attribute to a governing maṣdar in an annexation\nA maṣdar which is governing a governee (like a doer or a direct doee) can be described by a attribute, but that attribute should occur after the maṣdar’s governees.4 For example, we should not say:\n\n✗ عرفت سوقك العنيف الإبل [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/108]\nI knew your harsh driving of the camels\n\nWe should say instead:\n\nعرفت سوقك الإبل العنيف\n\n\n\nA attribute to the governee of a maṣdar in an annexation\nWhen the maṣdar is governing a doer or a direct doee in an annexation, and that governee is to be described by a attribute, then the attribute may, optionally, be either in the i-state, or in the u-state for the doer and the a-state for the direct doee.5 So we can say:\n\nعجبت من شرب زيد الظريف والظريف [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/104]\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَكْلِ الطَّعَامِ الْحَارِّ/الْحَارَّ زَيْدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/189]\nI wondered at the eating of the hot food [by] Zayd\n\n\n\nA conjunction to the governee of a maṣdar in an annexation\nWhen the maṣdar is governing a doer or a direct doee in an annexation, and that governee is followed by a conjunction and post-conjunction, then the post-conjunction may, optionally, be either in the i-state, or in the u-state for the doer and the a-state for the direct doee.6 So we can say:\n\nسَاءَنِي إِهْمَالُ سَعِيدٍ وَخَالِدٍ/خَالِدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/189]\nكَرِهْتُ أَكْلَ الْخُبْزِ وَاللَّحْمِ/اللَّحْمَ [Wright 2/58A]\nI disliked eating the bread and the meat.\nسَاءَنِي ضَرْبُ خَالِدٍ وَسَعِيدٍ/سَعِيدًا خَلِيلٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/189]",

    "section": "27.5 The maṣdar as a verb-like governor compared to the doer participle",
    "text": "27.5 The maṣdar as a verb-like governor compared to the doer participle\nWe have already seen, in chapter (ref), that the doer participle is also a noun that is related to a verb, and that can govern in a verb-like manner. But the maṣdar and the doer participle are different in how they govern a doer and a direct doee.\nFirstly, the maṣdar is a primitive noun. So it does not govern a latent doer pronoun. When the maṣdar is governing a direct doee without a doer as in example () مَنَعَهُمْ مِنْ قَوْلِ الْحَقِّ then, no latent doer pronoun is theoretical modeled.\nSecondly, when the maṣdar is governing in an annexation, (for example عَجِبْتُ مِنْ ضَرْبِ زَيْدٍ عَمْرًا) then this annexation is real, not superficial.10 However, when the doer participle is governing in an annexation, then the annexation is superficial (see section (ref)).\nThirdly, the doer participle not prefixed by ال only governs in a verb-like manner when it has an imperfective meaning. The maṣdar on the other hand can govern for both a perfective and imperfective meaning. For example:\n\nعجبت من ضربك زيدا أمس/غدا/الآن [modified from شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/94]\n\nThe maṣdar as a verb-like governor does have one similarity to the governing doer participle. And that is that both their doers are not the structure-starter of a new sentence. So, for example, in the sentence:\n\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ شُرْبِ الْعَسَلِ زَيْدٌ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/102]\n\nthe doer زَيْد does not form an inner sentence with the maṣdar شُرْب. Rather, the maṣdar شُرْب, as a single-word element, is in the i-state, governed by the preposition مِنْ.\nAn exception to the doer of a maṣdar not being a structure-starter, and also to the maṣdar not governing a latent doer pronoun, is when the maṣdar occurs as the deputy to a verb. For example:\n\nضربا زيدا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/93]\nHit Zayd!\n\nThe maṣdar as a deputy to a verb will be covered in more detail in section (mmutlaq), if Allāh wills.\nTODO: Add to mmutlaq chapter",

There are relatively fewer from stem 2 verbs. Most form broken plurals. All the plurals above are amongst those that are attested usage from Classical Arabic.\nMost maṣdars are not attested to have plurals from Classical Arabic. For example, perhaps we may not find the maṣdar اسْتِعْمَال (from the verb اسْتَعْمَلَ يَسْتَعْمِلُ) to have the its plural as attested usage in Classical Arabic. This has led some grammarians to restrict plurals of maṣdars to only those recorded from attested usage.14\nAfter the era of native Classical Arabic, when sca became the language of science and literature, new terms and meanings were added to the language and used with their technical meanings. Many of these new terms are maṣdar→entity nouns and they are often from higher stem verbs. Here are some examples15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaṣdar→entity noun\nplural\nverb\n\n\n\n\nاسْتِعْمَال a use\nاسْتِعْمَالَات\nاسْتَعْمَلَ يَسْتَعْمِلُ to use (هـ s.th.)\n\n\nاحْتِمَال a possible interpretation\nاحْتِمَالَات\nاحْتَمَلَ يَحْتَمِلُ to bear a meaning (of a text)\n\n\nاعْتِقَاد a creed\nاعْتِقَادَات\nاعْتَقَدَ يَعْتَقِدُ to believe (a creed)\n\n\nإِشْكَال a textual difficulty\nإِشْكَالَات\nأَشْكَلَ يُشْكِلُ to be difficult (of a text)\n\n\nتَعْرِيف a definition\nتَعْرِيفَات\nعَرَّفَ يُعَرِّفُ to define (هـ s.th.)\n\n\nتَفْسِير an explanation\nتَفَاسِير\nفَسَّرَ يُفَسِّرُ to explain (هـ s.th.)\n\n\nحَذْف a deletion\nحُذُوف\nحَذَفَ يَحْذِفُ to delete (هـ s.th.)\n\n\n\nBecause of the need to pluralize technical terms, some scholars have permitted that new maṣdar→entity nouns can be pluralized without restriction.16\nAs you can see, many of these maṣdar→entity nouns are from higher stem verbs. Since, broken plurals are not easily formed from words with many letters, the āt plural is preferred for these maṣdar→entity nouns. The maṣdar pattern تَفْعِيل of stem 2 فَعَّلَ verbs can easily form a plural on the pattern تَفَاعِيل, but even for new maṣdar→entity nouns on this pattern, the āt plural often tends to be in current usage.\nRemember, however, from section (ref), that there are conditions that should be satisfied in order for a word to have a āt plural. So if a maṣdar→entity noun does not end with ة and has fewer than five letters than we may prefer to form a broken plural than a āt plural. Nevertheless the āt plural may be more common in actual usage. For example: بَيَان a statement, plural: أَبْيِنَة, بَيَانَات. 17\n\n\n27.14.2 The ability of maṣdar→entity nouns to govern in a verb-like manner\nThe default for concrete entity nouns is that they will not govern in a verb-like manner. But a maṣdar→entity noun,  even though it has crossed over to a entity noun, its maṣdar origin retains some influence. Because of this, we do sometimes find  a maṣdar→entity noun governing in a verb-like manner. This is most apparently visible in the plural of a maṣdar→entity noun. For example:\n\nوجرّبوه فما زادتْ تجاربُهم أبا قدامةَ إلّا الحزمَ والفَنَعا [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 107]\nAnd they tried him, but their tryings of Abū Qudāmah did not increase but [his] resolve and contentment\n(The plural maṣdar→entity noun تَجَارِب is governing أَبا in the a-state as a direct doee.)",

    "text": "27.15 The maṣdar→adjectival noun\nA maṣdar→adjectival noun is a maṣdar that crosses over to be used like a adjectival noun. For example, the maṣdar عَدْل of the verb عَدَلَ يَعْدِلُ to act justly is used as a adjectival noun to mean just. Similarly, the maṣdar رِضًى of the verb رَضِيَ يَرْضَى to be pleased is used as a adjectival noun to mean pleasing. Here is an example sentence:\n\nهذا رجلٌ عدلٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/238]\nThis is a just man.\n\nWhen a maṣdar is used as a adjectival noun, then, normally, it is not feminized, dualized or pluralized, regardless of the number or gender of the described noun. So we will say:\n\nمررت برجل عدل أو رضي [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\nمررت بامرأتين رضي [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\nمررت برجلين عدل [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\nمررت برجال عدل [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\n\nSometimes, a particular maṣdar is used very often as a adjectival noun. Then, exceptionally, it is feminized and pluralized.18 Such is the case with the maṣdar→adjectival noun عَدْل. So we can (optionally) say:\n\nامرأة عدلة [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\nنساء عدلات [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\nقوم عدول [شرح الفارضي على ألفية ابن مالك 3/176]\n\nAlso, excepted from the restriction of not being pluralized is a maṣdar→adjectival noun which ends with a ة. This is readily pluralized with a āt plural. For example ثِقَة trustworthy. So we can say:\n\nرِجَالٌ ثِقَاتٌ\ntrustworthy men",

    "text": "28.1 The need for governing the preposition\nIn the Arabic grammatical model, prepositional phrases are dispensable elements. In order to bring a dispensable stateful element into a sentence, a suitable element of the original sentence must act as governor of the new dispensable element. For example, consider the sentence\nWe would like to add the prepositional phrase عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ “on the ground” to the sentence, thus:\nIn order to do this, a suitable element in the original sentence (جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ) must act as the governor for the preposition عَلَىٰ. The verb جَلَسَ is this suitable element.\nNow, you may be thinking: we introduced the concept of government for determining the state of an element. But prepositions don’t have state. So why should they need to be governed, and in what manner may they be governed?\nThis is a valid objection. “Governing” a preposition is definitively problematic.1 However, we can work around this problem with the following reasoning:\nThe noun ٱلْأَرْضِ is governed by the preposition عَلَىٰ and not directly by the verb جَلَسَ This is because it is the preposition which causes the noun following it to be in the i-state. In order to bring the dispensable (stateful) element ٱلْأَرْض in the sentence, we have to establish an unbroken chain of governor-governee dependencies that links back to a governing element in the original sentence. Saying that عَلَىٰ is governed by جَلَسَ allows us to accomplish this. So جَلَسَ will govern عَلَىٰ. And عَلَىٰ will govern ٱلْأَرْض.\nADD DIAGRAM\nAnother way to look at this is that a prepositional phrase may be parsed (virtually) as a direct doee.2 Consider the example:\nIn the above example, the prepositional phrase بِزَيْدٍ may be parsed (virtually) as in the a-state as a direct doee. So much so, that if we wish to add a second doee using a conjunction then it may be added in the a-state. For example:\nOf course the more usual مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٍو is also permitted.\nSo we can consider the verb as governing the entire prepositional phrase in the a-state. And within the prepositional phrase, the preposition governs its following noun in the i-state.\nADD DIAGRAM",

    "text": "28.2 Prepositions not needing a governor\nWhat we have just said regarding a preposition requiring a governor is true of essential prepositions. An essential preposition is that which, by its addition, gives a distinctly new meaning to the sentence. They are also used to connect an indirect doee to its governing verb. The preposition ب in (3) مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ is an example of an essential preposition.\nThere also exist non-essential prepositions. These merely give emphasis to an existing meaning in the sentence. Non-essential prepositions do not need a governor. Here is an example of a non-essential preposition:\n\nما جاء من رجلٍ [استيفاء حالات تعلق الجار والمجرور و الظرف وأثره في المعنى لعلي هاني]\n“Not a man came.”\n\nThe preposition مِنْ only emphasizes the meaning of the sentence. If we drop if the basic meaning would remain the same:\n\nما جاء رجلٌ [استيفاء حالات تعلق الجار والمجرور و الظرف وأثره في المعنى لعلي هاني]\n“Not a man came.”\n\nBy the way, مِنْ happens to be a non-essential preposition in the example above.

For example:\nBut if the multiple governees are the same prepositon, then in general they may not be governed by the same governor.6 So we can’t say:\n\n✗ مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِعَمْرٍو [شرح التصريح وحاشية ياسين 1/378]\n“I passed by Zayd by Ɛamr”\n(although, separting the second preposition with a conjunction is of course allowed: مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَبِعَمْرٍو.)\n\nBut if the same preposition is used with different meanings then it is permissible to have them being governed by the same governor. For example:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِٱلْبَادِيَةِ [شرح التصريح وحاشية ياسين 1/378]\n“I passed by Zayd in the desert.”\n\nIf the first preposition restricts the verb, and the second preposition is applied after the verb has been restricted, then too may the multiple same prepositions be used.7 For example:\n\nكُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقًا [سورة البقرة 2:25]\n(The first مِنْ restricts the governing verb رُزِقُوا to ٱلْجَنًّات “the gardens”. And the second مِنْ is restricted to “from the fruit from the gardens.”8)",

    "text": "28.5 A meaningful connection between the preposition and its governor\nIn order for a preposition to be governed by a governor, there needs to be a meaningful connection between the governor and the governed prepositional phrase.9\nConsider the following example:\n\nشَبَّهْتُ خَالِدًا وَهُوَ يَجُودُ بِمَالِهِ بِٱلْبَحْرِ [معاني النحو 3/131]\n“I likened K͡hālid, while he (was) being generous with his wealth, with the sea.”\n(The و in وَهُوَ يَجُودُ is translated as “while.” See section (ref).)\n\nIn the above example, the prepositional phrase بِٱلبَحْرِ “with the sea” is meaningfully connected to the verb شَبَّهَ “to liken,” not with the verb يَجُودُ “to be generous.” Therefore, it is شَبَّهَ that governs the preposition in بِٱلبَحْرِ, not يَجُودُ.\nSimilarly, the prepositional phrase بِمَالِهِ “with his wealth” is meaningfully connected to the verb يَجُودُ “to be generous,” not with the verb شَبَّهَ “to liken.” Therefore, it is يَجُودُ that governs the preposition in بِمَالِهِ, not شَبَّهَ.\nHere is another example:\n\nٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ دِينِكُمْ [سورة المائدة 5:3 cited by معاني النحو 3/131]\n“This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion;”\n\nIn the above example, the prepositional phrase مِنْ دِينِكُمْ “of your religion is meaningfully connected to the verb يَئِسَ”to despair,” not with the verb كَفَرَ “to disbelieve” Therefore, it is يَئِسَ that governs the preposition in مِنْ دِينِكُمْ not كَفَرَ.10",

    "section": "28.6 The combination of verbs with prepostions: the indirect doee",
    "text": "28.6 The combination of verbs with prepostions: the indirect doee\nIn theory, prepositions impart their own meanings.11 And there is no restriction on which prepositions may be used with a given governing verb (or verbal noun), as long as the prepositional phrase be meaningfully connected with its governor.12\nThe following examples show a possible set of prepositions that are meaningfully governed by the verb ٱنْصَرَفَ “to turn around, leave”:\n\nٱنْصَرَفَ إِلَىٰ مَصْنَعِهِ [النحو الوافي 2/161]\n“He left to his workplace.”\nٱنْصَرَفَ مِنَ ٱلْمَصْنَعِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِهِ [النحو الوافي 2/161]\n“He left from the workplace to his house.”\nٱنْصَرَفَ ٱلْعَالِمُ عَنِ ٱلْهَزْلِ [النحو الوافي 2/161]13\n“The scholar left off joking.”\nٱنْصَرَفَ فِي سَيَّارَتِهِ [النحو الوافي 2/161]\n“He left in his caravan.”\n\nHaving said that, in practice, certain verbs are more meaningfully connected with certain prepositions, sometimes almost to the exclusion of others.14 For example, the verb أَقْسَمَ “to swear” requires the preposition بِ in order to transit to what is being sworn by.15 For example,\n\nأقسم بالله [أسرار العربية للأنباري 203]\n“I swear by Allāh”\n\nThe combination of a verb and its governed preposition can even acquire a specific meaning. Consider, for example, the verb وَجَدَ. It’s basic meaning is “to find.” It may be used with prepositions like بِ, عَلَىٰ, فِي with this basic meaning. For example:\n\nوَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِجَهْدٍ\n“I found the book with effort.”\nوَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\n“I found the book in the house.”\nوَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ عَلَى ٱلْخِزَانَةِ\n“I found the book on the cupboard.”\n\nBut this verb also has specific meanings when used with these prepositions and certain indirect doees (albeit possibly with different maṣdars). For example:\n\nوَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ [Lane: root وجد]\n“He was angry with him.”\nوَجَدَ بِهَا [Lane: root وجد]\n“He loved her.”\nقَدْ وَجَدَ فِي نَفْسِهِ عَلَىَّ [صحيح مسلم :1649b]\n“he may have some feelings against me”\n\nIn such cases, the preposition almost seems to lose some of its independent meaning. Instead, the meaning of the expression is obtained from the combination of the verb with the prepostion.",

    "text": "28.7 The implication of general beingness\nConsider the sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 2/211]\n“Zayd is in the house.”\n\nWe mentioned in section (ref) above, that the governor of a preposition must be a verb, or what has the effect of a verb. But we find no such word in the sentence above. So what then is the governor of the preposition فِي?\nIn order to remain consistent with the Arabic grammatical model, we implicate the involvement of an implied governor. This implied governor has the meaning given by the verb “is” or its verbal noun “being”. We will refer to it as general beingness.\nIn Arabic grammatical terminology, general beingness is represented by the verb ٱسْتَقَرَّ or its doer participle مُسْتَقِرّ, or by the word كَائِن, which is the doer participle of the verb كَانَ.\nUsing these representations of general beingness, we can explicate (one interpretation of) example (26) زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ as:\n\nزَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ] فِي ٱلدَّارِ\n“Zayd is [being] in the house.”\n\nThe word “being” is not really needed in the translation because the verb “is” conveys the same concept. But we have added it to explicate the involvement of general beingness in the grammar of the sentence.\nNote that implicating general beingness in a sentence as we did in example (27) above is not same as if the words ٱسْتَقَرَّ “to settle”, مُسْتَقِرّ “settled”, or كَائِن “being” were actually expressed. When expressed, they impart their own meaning. For example\n\nزَيْدٌ مُسْتَقِرٌّ فِي ٱلدَّارِ\n“Zayd is settled in the house.”\n\nWhen implicating general beingness we only use the words ٱسْتَقَرَّ, مُسْتَقِرّ, and كَائِن terminologically. In fact, according to the prevalent opinion among the grammarians, general beingness can only be implied.16 If one of these (or any other) words is actually expressed, then it will impart a specific meaning, not the meaning of general beingness. Having said that, some grammarians did permit general beingness to be expressed.17",

Remember how we said that, in the Arabic grammatical model, the preposition is a dispensable element. So if we remove it (and the following i-state noun ٱلدَّار) from the sentence, we should still be left with a complete sentence. Let’s try doing that:\n\nزَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ]\n“Zayd is [being].”\n\nSee how the implied general beingness serves as the structural structure-completer: the info. If we were to not implicate general beingness, we would be left with a grammatically incomplete sentence.\nWe also take this opportunity to explain an apparent inconsistency. Back in chapter (ref), we had said that a prepositional phrase can be the info of a sentence. We now state that, strictly speaking, it is the (implied) governor of the prepostion which is the info. But because the actual info is implied and is not expressed, we can say, loosely speaking, that the prepositional phrase is the info.\nThis approach of applying a terminological label differently when loosely speaking vs when strictly speaking is common.18 We will see other examples of it in sections (refs) if Allāh wills.",

This is done on the condition that that the overall meaning or context supplies the meaning of the suppressed governor.19 For example:\n\nٱلْحُرُّ بٱلْحُرِّ [سورة البقرة 2:178 cited by النحو الوافي 2/447]\n“the free for the free”\n\nIn the above example, the info has been analyzed as the implied governor يَقْتَصُّ “is retributed against” or يُقْتَلُ “is killed”.

    "text": "28.10 The prepositional phrase as a attribute\nConsider the sentence\n\nرأيتُ طائرًا على الغصن [استيفاء حالات تعلق الجار والمجرور و الظرف وأثره في المعنى لعلي هاني]\n“I saw a bird on the branch.”\n\nNow the logical assumption is that the bird was on the branch, not that my act of seeing was done on a branch. So this means that the preposition عَلَىٰ is not meaningfully connected with the verb رَأَىٰ. Therefore, رَأَىٰ is not the governor of the preposition عَلَىٰ.21 So what then is governing the preposition عَلَىٰ.\nHere again, we implicate the governor of general beingness, as if to say:\n\nرأيتُ طائرًا [مُسْتَقِرًّا] على الغصن\n“I saw a bird [being] on the branch.”\n\nGeneral beingness [مُسْتَقِرًّا] is implicated as the governor of the preposition عَلَىٰ. The implicated general beingness is also a attribute to the direct doee طَائِرًا. But because the implied general beingness is not expressed, we may say, loosely speaking, that the prepositional phrase is the attribute.\nIn order for a prepositional phrase to be a attribute, its attributee will usually be an indefinite noun, like طَائِرًا is in example (31) above. In the case where the prepositional phrase occurs after a definite noun, (like in رأيتُ ٱلطائر على الغصن) it will typically be analyzed as a ḥāl. We will discuss this in more detail in chapter (ref) section (ref) if Allāh wills.\nHere are some more examples of prepositional phrases as attributes:\n\n\nكَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ [سورة البقرة 2:265]\n“like a garden on high ground”\n(بِرَبْوَةٍ is analyzed as a attribute.22)\nرَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِیهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْمْهُ [سورة البقرة 2:129]\n“Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves”\n(مِنْهُمْ is analyzed as a attribute.23)\n\n\nWhen a prepositional phrase is, loosely speaking, a attribute, its governor is typically the implicated general beingness.24.  However, it is conceivable that the implied governor of the preposition be interpreted, if not formally then at least in meaning, as some other verb (or verbal noun).25 For example:\n\nفِی تِسْعِ ءَایَاتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ [سورة النمل 27:12]\n“[These are] among the nine signs [you will take] to Pharaoh and his people.”\n\nIn one interpretation of the above āyah, the prepositional phrase إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ “to Pharoah” has been analyzed as attribute of ءَایَاتٍ “signs”. The meaning with the implicated governor has been explained as وَاصِلَةٌ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ “arriving to Pharoah”.26\nHere is another example:\n\nفَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ [سورة التوبة 9:125]\n“it has [only] increased them in evil [in addition] to their evil”\n\nIn the above āyah, the prepositional phrase إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ “to their evil” has been analyzed as attribute of رِجْسًا “evil”. The meaning with the implicated governor has been explained as كُفْرًاً مَضْمُومًا إِلَىٰ كُفْرِهِمْ “in disbelief in addition to their disbelief.”27",

For example, we saw in section (ref), that when a doer participle is prefixed with ال, then its governees may not precede it. So for example, we cannot say ✗ هذا زيدا الضارب. We have to say instead ✓ هذا الضارب زيدا. But an exception is made for the preposition which is governed by the doer participle. So we can say:\n\nأنا لك المرافق [النحو الوافي 3/263]\nI am, for you, the travelling companion.\n\nWe will see, in sections (refs) if Allāh wills that the governee, in this case, are permitted to be placed where other types of governees are not.\nTODO: Add content to:\n\nإِنَّ and its sisters: ibn_aqil 1/278 fn; 1/349\nكَانَ and its sisters كان زيد آكلا طعامك\nḤijāzi مَا: sharh uthaymeen 22/4 (مكا بي أنت معينا)\n\n\n\n\n28.13.1 Word-order of the direct doee and its governor\nConsider example (43) again:\n\nضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا\n“Zayd beat Ɛamr.”\n\nThere are six possible permutations of word-order of the above example.\n…\n\nعمرا زيد ضرب\n\nIn examples … the doee عمرا precedes its governor ضرب. This is generally permitted for stylistic (?) aspects, as we will discuss in chapter (ref).\nLets consider exaple … in more detail. This is because the doee is governed by ضرب in the info. But it precedes, not just its governor but also the subject of the outer sentence. This is normal for some types of governees (like the prep). But for the mafulb some grammarians consider it impermissible. Others allow it, but consider it rare or weak in its structure.\nPeled, Sentence types considers this dubious or unattested.

In this chapter, we will learn about a new type of verb, whose doer is called its subject, and whose direct doee is called its info.\nThe principal verb of this type is كَانَ which is used to mean “was”. There are other verbs which behave in a similar manner and they are called the sisters of كَانَ.",

    "text": "29.2 كَانَ as a deficient verb\nIn chapter (gov), we learned that a verbal sentence is formed from a verb and its doer. The verb constitutes the structure-completer and its doer constitutes the structure-starter. For example:\n\nقَامَ زَيْدٌ\nZayd stood up.\n\nIn example (1) above قَامَ is the structure-completer and زَيْدٌ is the structure-starter.\nMost verbs behave in this manner. They are termed sufficient verbs because the verb contains sufficient meaning to be the structure-completer by expressing some property about its doer (the structure-starter).\nThere are some verbs, however, that do not contain sufficient meaning to be the structure-completer of a sentence. These verbs are termed deficient verbs. For such verbs, the verb’s direct doee is needed to complete the meaning of the sentence. The verb كَانَ, which means “was”, is one such verb. If we say كَانَ زَيْدٌ Zayd was then the meaning is, in general, incomplete. The listener would be left wondering, Zayd was what?  So, in order to complete the meaning of the sentence, we have to add a direct doee for كَانَ. For example:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا [Peled, Sentence types 171]\nZayd was standing\n\nNow the sentence is structurally complete.",

    "text": "29.3 A كَانَ sentence as a nounal sentence\nThe fact that كَانَ is not a structural element of its sentence also changes the classification of the sentence. The structure-starter in example (2) زَيْدٌ needs a structure-completer to complete the sentence. Because the verb كَانَ does not complete the meaning of the sentence, therefore it cannot be the structure-completer. The sentence becomes structurally complete when we add the direct doee قَائِمًا. Therefore, the direct doee قَائِمًا is the structure-completer.\nSo structural elements in example (2) become زَيْدٌ (the structure-starter) and قَائِمًا (the structure-completer). These two are nouns, not a verb and its doer. Therefore the sentence is reclassified as a nounal sentence, not a verbal sentence (see section (3amal)).1 زَيْدٌ is considered the subject, and قَائِمًا is considered the info.2\nAlthough كَانَ is not a structural element anymore, it still governs both structural elements. Therefore, it is the foundational government of the sentence (see section (ref)).\n\nThe diagram below depicts the government of example (2).\nDIAGRAM",

    "section": "29.5 Word order of كَانَ, its subject, and its info",
    "text": "29.5 Word order of كَانَ, its subject, and its info\n\n\nVerb, subject, info\nIn sentence word order, the natural sequence is verb, subject, info.\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا [Wright 2/100B]\nZayd was standing.\n\n\n\nVerb, info, subject\nThe sequence verb, info, subject is also permissible.\n\nكَانَ قَائِمًا زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/100B]\nZayd was standing.\n\n\n\nInfo, verb, subject\nSo is the sequence info, verb, subject:\n\nقَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/100B]\nZayd was standing.\n\nThis last order is common in questions and alternative sentence sentences.3 For example:\n\nأَقَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ\nWas Zayd standing?\nأَكْرِمْ الضَّيْفَ غَنِيًّا كَانَ أَوْ فَقِيرًا [Wright 2/100B]\nHonor the guest, be he rich or poor.\n\nSometimes, however, this inversion is impossible because of an indistinguishable state of the two nouns.\nFor example, in order to express My brother was my companion, we must say:\n\nكَانَ أَخِي رَفِيقِي [Wright 2/100C]\nMy brother was my companion.\n\nThis is because, if we invert it, it would naturally mean:\n\nكَانَ رَفِيقِي أَخِي [Wright 2/100C]\nMy companion was my brother.\n\n\n\nSubject, verb, info\nWhat about the sequence: subject, verb, info? For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ كَانَ قَائِمًا\nZayd – he was standing.\n\nRemember that a verb must be followed by its doer. So this is actually a compound sentence. زَيْدٌ is the subject of the outer sentence. And the info of the outer sentence is the inner sentence كَانَ قَائِمًا. The subject of كَانَ is a latent pronoun, implicated a [هُوَ].\n\n\nWord order when كَانَ’s info has a a-state governee\nWe know from chapter (ref) that a deverbal noun can have a doee. The natural word order is for this doee to occur after its governor, thus:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ [الأشباه والنظائر للسيوطي 2/59]\nZayd was eating your food.\n\nOther word orders are also possible. We will discuss the different combinations below:\n\nBasic order: كَانَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا\n\n✓ كَانَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ\n\n✓ كَانَ زَيْدٌ طَعَامَكَ آكِلًا\n\n✓ طَعَامَكَ كَانَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا\n\n✗ كَانَ طَعَامَكَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا\n\nBasic order: كَانَ آكِلًا زَيْدٌ\n\n✓ كَانَ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ زَيْدٌ\n\n✓ كَانَ آكِلًا زَيْدٌ طَعَامَكَ\n\n✓ طَعَامَكَ كَانَ آكِلًا زَيْدٌ\n\n✗ كَانَ طَعَامَكَ آكِلًا زَيْدٌ\n\nBasic order: آكِلًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ\n\n✓ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ كَانَ زَيْدٌ\n\n✓ طَعَامَكَ آكِلًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ\n\n✓ آكِلًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ طَعَامَكَ\n\n✗ آكِلًا كَانَ طَعَامَكَ زَيْدٌ\n\n\nAs you can see, only three of the combinations are disallowed.4 And in all three كَانَ is separated from its subject (زَيْدٌ ) by the governee (طَعَامَكَ) of its info (آكِلًا).\nEven some of these disallowed combinations become permitted if the governee of the info of كَانَ is not a direct doee but a preposition or an adverb of time and place. Recall from section (ref) that the word order of prepositions and adverbs of time and place is especially flexible. So we can say:\n\nكَانَ عِنْدَكَ زَيْدٌ مُقِيمًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/280]\nZayd was, at your place, staying.\nكَانَ فِيكَ زَيْدٌ رَاغِبًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/280]\nZayd was, of [your favour], desirous\n\nSome of the combinations above, though allowed, are considered ungainly by some grammarians5, like (20) (3) آكِلًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ طَعَامَكَ. But again, if the governee of the info of كَانَ is not a direct doee but a preposition or an adverb of time and place, then there is no problem. For example:\n\nمُسَافِرًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ الْيَوْمَ [الهمع للسيوطي 1/432]\nJourneying Zayd was today\nرَاغِبًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ فِيكَ [الهمع للسيوطي 1/432]\nDesirous Zayd was, of [your favour]\n\n\n\nWord order of a compound sentence when كَانَ’s info has a a-state governee\nThe subject can made to precede كَانَ, such that it becomes a compound sentence:\n\nزَيْدٌ كَانَ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ [الأشباه والنظائر للسيوطي 2/59]\n\nNow the subject of كَانَ is a latent pronoun [هُوَ]. Since this latent pronoun is attached to كَانَ, the info آكِلًا’s governee طَعَامَك can no longer come between كَانَ and its subject. Now all twelve combinations are permissible.6, Here is a sampling out of them:\n\n\nطَعَامَكَ زَيْدٌ كَانَ آكِلًا [الأشباه والنظائر للسيوطي 2/59]\n\nزَيْدٌ طَعَامَكَ آكِلًا كَانَ [الأشباه والنظائر للسيوطي 2/59]\n\nطَعَامَكَ آكِلًا زَيْدٌ كَانَ [الأشباه والنظائر للسيوطي 2/59]",

    "text": "29.9 A maṣdari ʾan as the subject or info of كَانَ\nRecall from chapter (ref) that the clause of a maṣdari ʾan is equivalent to a maṣdar, which is a noun. Consider the following example:\n\n\nثُمَّ لَمۡ تَكُن فِتۡنَتُهُمۡ إِلَّاۤ أَن قَالُوا۟ وَٱللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشۡرِكِینَ [سورة الأنعام 6:23 cited by البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 714]\nThen there will be no [excuse upon] examination except they will say, “By Allāh, our Lord, we were not those who associated.”\n\nThe clause أَنْ قَالُوا is equivalent to قَوْلُهُمْ their saying. Due to this equivalence to a noun, a maṣdari ʾan can be the subject or the info of كَانَ. For the āyah in example (31), فِتْنَة is read in both the u-state (فِتْنَتُهُمْ) and the a-state (فِتْنَتَهُمْ) in different recitations.9 So the أَنْ قَالُوا clause is analyzed as the subject of كَانَ when فِتْنَة is read in the a-state as the info. and it is analyzed as the info of كَانَ when فِتْنَة is read in the u-state as the subject.\nIn general, a maṣdari ʾan will be more likely to be the subject because is is considered more definite.10",

    "text": "29.10 A complete sentence as the info of كَانَ\nSo far we have seen examples where the info of كَانَ is a single noun in the a-state. In example (17) كَانَ زَيْدٌ آكِلًا طَعَامَكَ the info of the كَانَ is the noun آكِلًا. The info آكِلًا is governing a latent doer pronoun [هُوَ] and the direct doee طَعَامَكَ, but still, the info itself is a single noun, not a complete sentence.\nHere is another example:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 662]\nZayd was setting out.\n\nIn example (32) above the info of كَانَ is the noun مُنْطَلِقًا.\nIn section (ref), we learned that the info of a nounal sentence can be a complete sentence. So, the info of كَانَ can be a complete sentence. For example:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ مُنْطَلِقٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 692]\nZayd – his father was setting out.\n(literally: Zayd was – his father is setting out.)\n\nIn example (33), the info of كَانَ is the complete sentence أَبُوهُ مُنْطَلِقٌ His father is setting out. As we stated in section (ref), when the info is a sentence, then internally it is governed independently with its own foundational government. So كَانَ has no governing effect within the info sentence.11 The inner sentence زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ has its own internal government with زَيْدٌ as the subject and مُنْطَلِقٌ as the info. That is why مُنْطَلِقٌ is in the u-state and not in the a-state.\nThe entire info sentence أَبُوهُ مُنْطَلِقٌ in in place of a a-state noun as the info of كَانَ.\nHere are some more examples of كَانَ with a sentence as its info:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ أَخُوهُ ضَاحِكٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 692]\nZayd – his brother was laughing.\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهُ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 692]\nZayd – setting out, his father was.\n(literally: Zayd was – setting out, his father is.)\n\nIn example, (35) above, the sentence info is مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهُ. مُنْطَلِقٌ is the fronted info and أَبُوهُ is the subject. Although this sentence is grammatically correct, we will see in the next section that a sababi info is more likely to be used instead.\nWhen كَانَ has a info that is a complete sentence, then the info of the inner sentence will match its subject in number and gender. For example:\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدَانِ أَبَوَاهُمَا حَسَنَانِ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 693]\nThe two Zayds – their fathers [were] handsome.\nكَانَ الزَّيْدَانِ حَسَنَانِ أَبَوَاهُمَا [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 693 footnote 3]\nThe two Zayds – handsome, their fathers [were].\n(fronted info.)\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ حَسَنُونَ آبَاؤُهُمْ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 693 footnote 3]\nThe Zayds – handsome, their fathers [were].\n(sound plural as the fronted info.)\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ حِسَانٌ آبَاؤُهُمْ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 693 footnote 3]\nThe Zayds – handsome, their fathers [were].\n(broken plural as the fronted info.)",

For example\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] was – Zayd is standing.\n\nIn example (40) above, the subject of كَانَ is a latent state-of-affairs pronoun [هُوَ]. And the info of كَانَ is the inner sentence زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ Zayd is standing. Compare example (40) with example (2) كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا, where the subject of كَانَ is زَيْدٌ. And the info of كَانَ is the single element قَائِمًا.\nSimilarly, if the subject of the inner sentence is a feminine noun, then the state-of-affairs pronoun subject of كَانَ is typically feminine, thus:\n\nكَانَتْ هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 745]\n[The state of affairs] was – Hind is standing.\n\nBy the way, although the gender of the state-of-affairs pronoun usually matches the gender of the subject of its info, it is possible for it to mismatch.12 (We also mentioned this in section (ref).)\nIn practice, usage of the state-of-affairs pronoun in sentences like example (40) كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ is uncommon, but nevertheless existent.13 Instead the construction in example (2) كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا is far more likely to be used. But, as we will see in sections (ref) and (ref), if Allāh wills, when the info of كَانَ is a verbal sentence, then the state-of-affairs pronoun is very commonly used as the subject of كَانَ.",

Instead of using a sentence info, we can reconstruct the sentence to have مُنْطَلِقًا to be the info of كَانَ, and have أَبُوهُ as the doer of the doer participle مُنْطَلِقًا, thus:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبُوهُ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 692]\nZayd – his father was setting out.\n\nThis is a sababi info construction. (See section (ref) for an introduction to the sababi info.) The info of كَانَ in example (42) above is not a complete sentence. Rather, it is the single element مُنْطَلِقًا. A sentence with a sababi info like (42) كَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبُوهُ will be preferred over a sentence with a fronted info like (35) كَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهُ.14\nWhen كَانَ has a sababi info, then, as mentioned in section (ref), it generally remains singular regardless whether its doer is dual or plural. So we get:\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدَانِ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبَوَاهُمَا\nThe two Zayds – their fathers [were] setting out.\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ مُنْطَلِقَةً جَدَّاتُهُمْ\nThe Zayds – their grandmothers [were] setting out.\n\nBut if the info has a broken plural, then it is permitted (and in fact preferred) to be used.15\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ حِسَانًا آبَاؤُهُمْ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 693]\nThe Zayds – their fathers [were] handsome.",

For example:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا\nZayd was standing.\n\nThis statement is regarding Zayd’s state in the past and the implication is that he is possibly no longer standing.\nThis is the most common signification of the perfect verb كَانَ and the one that we have been using so far. But كَانَ is special in that it admits additional significations:\nThe second signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that, at first, had not yet begun, and which then began and remained, possibly up to the present. It has, in this sense, the meaning became, has become, or happened. Examples:\n\nأَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ [سورة البقرة 2:34]\nHe refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\nاحْتَرَقَ الْخَشَبُ فَكَانَ تُرَابًا\n[النحو الوافي 1/548]\nThe wood burned and so became dust.\n\nA third signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that will be in the future. For example:\n\nوَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًۭا كَانَ شَرُّهُۥ مُسْتَطِيرًۭا [سورة الإنسان 76:7]\nand [they] fear a Day whose evil will be widespread.\n\nA fourth signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that always existed and will always exist.17 For example:\n\nوَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًۭا رَّحِيمًۢا [سورة الأحزاب 33:73]\nAnd ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.\nوَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلزِّنَىٰٓ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَـٰحِشَةًۭ وَسَآءَ سَبِيلًۭا [سورة الإسراء 17:32]\nAnd do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse.1 Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.",

    "text": "29.16 Significations of the u-state stateful verb يَكُونُ\n\n29.16.1 يَكُونُ used for habitual is\nConsider the sentence, The mother cooks the food. The verb cooks implies that the action is habitually done, not necessarily that it is being done at present. If we wished to say that the action is being done at present, we might instead say, The mother is cooking the food. English maintains this distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs. But it does not for ther verb is. So if we say, The sky is blue, then it can mean both (i) that the sky is blue at present, or (ii) that it is habitually blue, not necessarily that it is blue at present.\nIn Arabic the situation is somewhat different. Arabic does not usually have a distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs. So تَطْبُخُ الْأُمُّ الطَّعَامَ may mean both (i) that the mother is cooking the food at present, or (ii) that she habitually does.\n\nBut for the verb is, Arabic can distinguish between the present and the habitual. So if we say السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءُ, then this can, in general, mean both (i) that the sky is blue at present, and (ii) that it is habitually blue. If we wish to specify the habitual meaning, we may use the stateful verb يَكُونُ, thus:\n\nتَكُونُ السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءَ\nThe sky is (habitually) blue.\n\nWhile we call this the habitual يَكُونُ, it can include a range of meanings, including continually, recurringly, regularly, typically, generally, often, sometimes, can, may, etc. Habitual يَكُونُ is negated using مَا or لَا, just like other u-state stateful verbs.\nHere are some examples:\n\nقَالَ وَمَا الْبِتْعُ وَالْمِزْرُ؟ قُلْتُ شَرَابٌ يَكُونُ مِنَ الْعَسَلِ وَالْمِزْرُ يَكُونُ مِنَ الشَّعِيرِ [سنن النسائي :5604]\nHe said: ‘What is mead and beer?’ I said: ‘A drink that is from honey, and beer is from barley.’ \nإِنَّهَا تَكُونُ الظُّلْمَةُ وَالسَّيْلُ [صحيح البخاري :667]\n[There] is [at times] darkness and flooding\n\n\n\n\n\n29.16.2 قَدْ يَكُونُ for may be\nWhen the meaning may be is desired, the the stateful verb يَكُونُ may be preceded by the particle قَدْ. For example,\n\nقَالَ أَبُو الدَّرْدَاء يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ يَسْرِقُ الْمُؤْمِنُ قَالَ قَدْ يَكُونُ ذَلكَ [https://hadithunlocked.com/suyuti:401-5b]18\nAbū al-Dardāʾ said, “O Messenger of Allah, Can a believer steal?” He said, “That may be.”\n\n\n\n29.16.3 يَكُونُ used for future will be\nAnother usage of the stateful verb يَكُونُ is for the future tense to mean will be. In this case, it is often preceded by سَ or سَوْفَ. سَ and سَوْفَ are optional and are commonly dropped, especially when the context indicates the future. Future يَكُونُ is negated by لَا. Here are some examples:\n\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبْتُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَكُونُ لِزَامًا [سورة الفرقان 25:77]\nFor you [disbelievers] have denied, so it [i.e., your denial] is going to be adherent.\nلا يَكونُ اللَّعَّانُونَ شُفَعَاءَ وَلَا شُهَدَاءَ يَومَ القِيَامَةِ [رياض الصالحين :1553]\nThe frequent cursers will be neither intercessors nor witnesses [on] the day of resurrection.\n(يَوْمَ is in the a-state because it is an adverb of time, see chapter @ref(adverb-of-time).)\nيَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ [سورة القارعة 101:4]\nIt is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed,\nيَكُونُ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ دَجَّالُونَ كَذَّابُونَ [صحيح مسلم :7]\nThere will be in the end of time charlatan liars",

    "section": "29.20 The perfect verb كَانَ combined with a stateful verb",
    "text": "29.20 The perfect verb كَانَ combined with a stateful verb\nIn section (ref) above, we mentioned that the info كَانَ can be a complete sentence. The examples we gave were where the info of كَانَ were nounal sentences. \nInstead of a nounal sentence as the info of كَانَ, the info is very often a verbal sentence. كَانَ combined with verbal sentences to express complex tenses. The most common combination is the perfect verb كَانَ with a stateful verb in its info.\n\nConsider again example (2):\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا [Peled, Sentence types 171]\nZayd was standing\n\nThe info of كَانَ is (as a single element) the doer participle قَائِمًا. Let’s try to replace the doer participle قَائِمًا with its stateful verb يَقُومُ. We get:\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nZayd used to stand.\n(literally: Zayd was – he stands.)\n\n\nWhen كَانَ is combined with a following stateful verb, or its doer participle, it indicates an imperfect action that was occurring in the past. The tense is usually either:\n\nPast-continuous (he was doing), or\nPast-habitual (he used to do).\n\nIn general, كَانَ with a stateful verb can indicate either tense. Whereas كَانَ with a doer participle typically indicates the past-continuous tense. The exact difference in signification between the doer participle and its stateful verb is discussed in more detail in chapter (ref).\nLet’s discuss the grammar of the new sentence (83) كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ. The subject of كَانَ is زَيْدٌ. And the info of كَانَ is the complete verbal sentence يَقُومُ he stands. The doer of the stateful verb يَقُومُ is the latent pronoun [هُوَ] that refers back to the subject زَيْدٌ.\n\nThe word order of كَانَ, its subject, and the stateful verb\nThe sequence (كَانَ, subject, stateful verb) is a very commonly used word order. But there is also another word order which is also very frequently used. And that is (كَانَ, stateful verb, subject). For example:\n\nكَانَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ\nZayd used to stand.\n\nThere are two methods to anaylyze example (84) above20:\nThe first method is to consider زَيْدٌ the doer of the stateful verb يَقُومُ. The sentence يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ Zayd stands is then the info of كَانَ. And the subject of كَانَ is a latent state-of-affairs pronoun [هُوَ]. The state-of-affairs pronoun will typically go untranslated in this case.\nThe second method is to consider زَيْدٌ the subject of كَانَ. The sentence يَقُومُ he stands (with a latent doer pronoun) is then the info of كَانَ, but which is made to precede its subject. By the way, it seems that this second method is not used when the subject is dual or plural. This is because we typically always find the stateful verb in the singular when it precedes the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular, dual, or plural. For example:\n\n✓ كَانَ يَقُومُ الزَّيْدَانِ\n✗ كَانَ يَقُومَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ\nThe two Zayds were standing.\n\nBoth word orders (83) كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ and (84) كَانَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ. have, more or less, a similar meaning.\nBut choosing one of two word orders can affect the conjugation of the stateful verb for dual and plural subjects. Here is a table that compares conjugations for the two options:\n\n\n\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ\nكَانَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ\n\n\nكَانَتْ هِنْدٌ تَقُومُ\nكَانَتْ تَقُومُ هِنْدٌ\n\n\nكَانَالزَّيْدَانِ يَقُومَانِ\nكَانَ يَقُومُ الزَّيْدَانِ\n\n\nكَانَتِ الْهِنْدَانِ تَقُومَانِ\nكَانَتْ تَقُومُ الْهِنْدَانِ\n\n\nكَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ يَقُومُونَ\nكَانَ يَقُومُ الزَّيْدُونَ\n\n\nكَانَتِ الْهِنْدَاتُ يَقُمْنَ\nكَانَتْ تَقُومُ الْهِنْدَاتُ\n\n\n\nWhen the subject of كَانَ is a dual or plural pronoun, then it seems that only the (كَانَ, subject, stateful verb) is used. And the (كَانَ, stateful verb, subject) is unused. For example:\n\n✓ كَانُوا يَقُومُونَ\n✗ كَانَ يَقُومُونَ\nThey were standing.\n\nHere are some more examples of كَانَ followed by a stateful verb:\n\nكَانَ يَعْبُدُ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ\nor\nكَانَ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ\nThe polytheists of Makkah used to worship idols.\nكَانَتْ تُحِبُّ الصَّدَقَةَ [صحيح البخاري :1420]\nShe used to love [to practice] charity.\nكَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ [سورة التغابن 64:6]\ntheir messengers used to come to them with clear evidences\n(Sound plurals, even of rational beings, may be treated as grammatically singular feminine. See section @ref(sound-plurals-sing-fem).)\nكُنْتُ أَلْعَبُ بِالْبَنَاتِ عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَكَانَ لِي صَوَاحِبُ يَلْعَبْنَ مَعِي [صحيح البخاري :6130]\nI used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and I had companionsf playing with me.\nOccasionally, the particle قَدْ precedes the combination of كَانَ and the stateful verb. Example:\nقَالُوا هَذَا قَدْ كَانَ يَكْتُبُ لِمُحَمَّدٍ [صحيح مسلم :2781]\nThey said, ‘This [person] used to transcribe for Muḥammad ﷺ’\nThe following stateful verb may also be an passive verb. Example:\nإِنَّ أُنَاسًا كَانُوا يُؤْخَذُونَ بِالْوَحْىِ فِي عَهْدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم [صحيح البخاري :2641]\nIndeed people were (sometimes) judged (literally: held) by the [revealing of] divine inspiration in the lifetime of the Prophet.\n\n\n29.20.1 One كَانَ suffices multiple stateful verbs\nIf the signification of an action ocurring continually in the past applies to more that one stateful verb, then it is sufficient to prefix كَانَ to only the first one. Example:\nكَانَتْ تَعْمَلُ بِيَدِهَا وَتَصَدَّقُ [صحيح مسلم :2452]\nShe used to work with her hand and spend (that income) on charity.\n(تَتَصَدَّقُ is abbreviated to تَصَدَّقُ. See section @ref(form-5-verbs-abbrev).)\n\n\n29.20.2 Negation of كَانَ and a stateful verb\nIn order to negate the combination of كَانَ and the following stateful verb, multiple options are available. Using يَفْعَلُ as an example stateful verb, we can have:\n\nمَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ\nلَمْ يَكُنْ يَفْعَلُ\nكَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ\n\nExamples:\nمَا كَانَ أَحَدٌ يَبْدَأُ، أَوْ يَبْدُرُ، ابْنَ عُمَرَ بِالسَّلامِ [الأدب المفرد :982]\nNo one preceded or got ahead of Ibn Ɛumar with (giving) the greeting.\nكَانُوا۟ لَا يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍۢ فَعَلُوهُ [سورة المائدة 5:79]\nThey used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did.\nلَمْ يَكُونُوا يَسْأَلُونَ عَنِ الإِسْنَادِ [صحيح مسلم :introduction]\nThey would not ask about the chains of narration\nIn terms of the differences between these constructions مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ imparts more emphasis in the denial than كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ.\nThere is also difference between the options مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ and كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ in terms of when one would be used instead of the other.21. For example, if someone says to you: I thought I saw you writing yesterday. To reply in the negative, you would say: مَا كُنْتُ أَكْتُبُ instead of كُنْتُ لَا أَكْتُبُ to mean I was not writing.\nThe construction مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ is also used when one wishes to say that one never used to do something due to one’s circumstances And also to mean that one did not know how to do something in the past. For example,\nمَا كُنْتُ أَحْفَظُ شِعْرًا\nI used to not memorize any poetry.\nAs for كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ, it connotes an intentional or purposeful lack of doing something. Whereas, with مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ, the lack of action may be incidental. For example, كَانَ لَا يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ “He used to not read the Qurʾān imparts that the person was intentionally not doing so. Whereas مَا كَانَ يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ does not convey the intentionality of the lack of action. For example, the person may not have been reading the Qurʾān because he did not know how to.\n\n\n29.20.3 The combination كَانَ يَكُونُ\nOccasionally, كَانَ can be combined with its own stateful verb يَكُونُ This gives the meaning was being or used to be. يَكُونُ is, in this combination, often optional and may be dropped for no change in meaning. Examples:\nكَانَ يَكُونُ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ [صحيح البخاري :676]\nand\nكَانَ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ [صحيح البخاري :6039]\nHe used to keep himself busy serving his family\nقَدْ كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي الأُمَمِ مُحَدَّثُونَ [جامع الترمذي :2398]\nThere used to be in the nations inspired persons\nرِجَالٌ كَانُوا يَكُونُونَ مَعَ ٱلْمُلُوكِ [Wright 2/21C]\nmen that used to be with the kings\nكَانَ يَكُونُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ [Fischer 107]\nHe used to be in the house.\n\n\n29.20.4 Possible occurrence\nSometimes كَانَ is used with a stateful verb to express an action that could, should, or would have occurred. Examples:\nكَانَ يَكُونُ سُوءَ أَدَبٍ [Fischer 108]\nIt would have been a misbehavior.\nفَقَالَ حُذَيْفَةُ أَنْتَ كُنْتَ تَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ [صحيح مسلم :1788]\nḤud͡hayfah said: ‘You might have done that.’\nThis meaning can also be for the future, for example in a question:\nأَىَّ شَىْءٍ كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ [سنن ابن ماجه :2606]\nWhich thing would you do?\n\n\n29.20.5 Omission of كَانَ\nIf one or more perfect verbs precedes the stateful verb or if the context indicates that the action was occurring in the past, then كَانَ can be omitted, and the stateful verb is used by itself.22 For example:\nقُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنۢبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ [سورة البقرة 2:91]\nSay,Then why did you kill the prophets of Allāh before”\n(No كُنْتُمْ before تَقْتُلُونَ.)\nوَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَا تَتْلُوا۟ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـٰنَ ۖ [سورة البقرة 2:102]\nAnd they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon\n(No كَانَتْ before تَتْلُو.)\n\n\n29.20.6 كَانَ followed by a doer participle or doee participle instead of a stateful verb\nInstead of a stateful verb after كَانَ, its doer participle or doee participle may be used instead. And this can give the effect of a state of being rather than an action being done. For example:\nكَانَ سَاكِنًا [Wright 2/198A]\nHe was dwelling\nكَانَتِ ٱلْعُصِيُّ مَرْكُوزَةً فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ [Wright 2/198A]\nThe staffs were sticking in the ground.\n(كَانَتْ تُرْكَزُ would imply that they were being stuck.)\nWhen the verbal noun refers to an action taking place in the future, the idea of futurity is transferred to a past time. For example:\nأَمْرٌ كَانَ مَفْعُولًا [Wright 2/196A]\na matter which was to be done",

    "text": "29.21 The perfect verb كَانَ combined with a perfect verb\nكَانَ is combined with a following perfect verb to denote an action completed prior to some past (specified or implied) point in time. Example:\n\nمَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ\n\n[Wright 2/5C]\nal-Ras͡hīd died at Ṭūs after (literally: and) he had set out for K͡hurāsān to combat Rāfiɛ ibn al-Layt͡h.\nThe particle قَدْ is often used when كَانَ is combined with a perfect verb. قَدْ may be placed either between كَانَ and the following perfect verb, or before كَانَ. Examples:\nكُنْتُ قَدْ رَبَّيْتُ جَارِيَةً [Wright 2/5C]\n I had brought up a girl\nقَدْ كَانَتْ فَرَغَتْ مِنْ عَمَلِهَا\nShe had been done with her work.\nWhen their are multiple perfect verbs, and one (or more) of them occurred farther in the past than the others, it is indicated with قَدْ, the others having merely كَانَ. We re-use a previous example here and extend it:\n\nمَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ. وَكَانَ رَافِعٌ هَـٰذَا قَدْ خَرَجَ وَخَلَعَ ٱلطَّاعَةَ وَتَغَلَّبَ عَلَىٰ سَمَرْقَنْدَ.\n\n[Wright 2/6A]\n“al-Ras͡hīd died at Ṭūs after he had set out for K͡hurāsān to combat Rāfiɛ ibn al-Layt͡h. And this Rāfiɛ had already rebelled and cast off his allegiance and taken forcible posession of Samarqand.”\n(Note how قَدْ is only used before Rāfiɛ’s action of rebelling.)\n\n29.21.1 Negation\nThis combination may, again, be negated in multiple ways. Examples:\nلاَ يَأْتِي ابْنَ آدَمَ النَّذْرُ بِشَىْءٍ لَمْ يَكُنْ قَدْ قَدَّرْتُهُ [صحيح البخاري :6609]\nVowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate,\nوَدِدْتُ أَنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ خَرَجْتُ الْعَامَ [سنن أبي داود :1778]\nI wish I had not come out (for Ḥajj) this year\nوَمَا كَانَ قَدْ أَتَاهَا بِشَيْءٍ [A report narrated in إحياء علوم الدين لأبي حامد الغزالي 3/139 without a chain]\nAnd he had not brought her anything",

For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/355]\nZayd – indeed he is standing.\n(The sentence إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ is the info of the subject زَيْدٌ.)\n\nWe will explore this more in section (inna vs anna) below).",

    "section": "30.3 أَنَّ anna",
    "text": "30.3 أَنَّ anna\n\n30.3.1 Interpretation of the أَنَّ clause as a maṣdar construction\nأَنَّ may be translated as “that”. أَنَّ is unique amongst إِنَّ and its sisters that when it transforms an input nounal sentence the output is actually not a structurally complete sentence anymore. Here is its output after transforming example (1):\n\nأَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ\nthat Zayd is standing\n\nAs you can see above, example (7) does not stand by itself as a complete sentence. Terminologically, زَيْدًا is the subject of أَنَّ and قَائِمٌ is its info. But once أَنَّ has been added to the sentence, then the resulting output actually only constitutes a single element of a sentence (in terms of sentence structure). Let’s explain what we mean by making example (7) a part of a larger sentence:\n\n\nيُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ\nThat Zayd is standing pleases me.\n\nNow the sentence is structurally complete. In this sentence, the أَنَّ clause (i.e. أَنَّ, its subject, and its info together) constitutes the structure-starter element of the sentence as the doer of the verb يُعْجِبُنِي. The verb يُعْجِبُنِي is the structure-completer of the sentence.\nThe grammarians have theorized that the أَنَّ clause is able to constitute a single sentence element because it is interpreted as a maṣdar construction. And the maṣdar is then able to take the place of a single element of the sentence. In example (8) the maṣdar is interpreted as follows:\n\nأَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ = قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ that Zayd is standing = Zayd’s [being] standing\n\n\nIf we replace the أَنَّ clause in example (8) with this interpreted maṣdar construction, we get:\n\nيُعْجِبُنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ\nZayd’s [being] standing pleases me..\n\nNow we can see how the interpreted maṣdar construction قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ constitutes the structure-starter of the sentence. (Technically, the annexe noun قِيَامُ is the structure-starter and زَيْدٍ is it its base noun governee, but loosely speaking they can be considered one unit.)\n\nBy the way, the interpretation of the أَنَّ clause as a maṣdar construction does not mean that the sentence with the maṣdar construction will have exactly the same meaning as the sentence with أَنَّ. Rather the maṣdar interpretation only helps us analyze the sentence grammatically. And it will also help us determine when we can use the maṣdari أَنَّ as opposed to other alternatives.\n\n\n30.3.2 أَنَّ clauses as different elements of a sentence\nLet’s get back to example (8) يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ That Zayd is standing pleases me. In this sentence, as we just discussed, أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ, because of its interpretation as the maṣdar construction قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ, constitutes a single element, in terms of sentence structure. In example (8), it constitutes the doer of a verbal sentence, which is a structural element. But an أَنَّ clause need not only constitute a doer, or a structural element for that matter. An أَنَّ clause may constitute various elements of a sentence. We will discuss them below:\n\nThe أَنَّ clause as a doer\nWe have already seen an example of the أَنَّ clause as the doer in example (8) يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ. Here is another example:\n\nبلغني أن زيدًا منطَلِقٌ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/176]\n[The news] that Zayd is setting out has reached me.\n\nIf we replace the أَنَّ clause with its interpreted maṣdar we get:\n\nبلغني انطلاق زيدٍ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/176]\nZayd’s setting out has reached me.\n\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause as a deputy doer\n\nعُرِفَ أَنَّ السَّارِقَ جَرِيءٌ [nawh_waadiH 1/264]\nThat the thief is bold was known.\n\nIf we replace the أَنَّ clause with its interpreted maṣdar we get:\n\nعُرِفَ جَرَاءَةُ السَّارِقِ [nawh_waadiH 1/264]\nThe thief’s boldness was known.\n\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause as a direct doee\nThe أَنَّ clause can occur in the position of a direct doee. Here is an example:\n\nعَلِمْتُ أنّكَ فَاضِلٌ\nI knew that you are excellent.\n\nIf we replace the أَنَّ clause with its interpreted maṣdar we get:\n\nعَلِمْتُ فَضْلَكَ\nI knew your excellence.\n\n\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause in the i-state\nThe أَنَّ clause can occur after a preposition. For example:\n\nعَجِبْتُ من أنّ بكرًا واقفٌ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/177]\nI wondered at that Zayd is stopped standing.\n\nIf we replace the أَنَّ clause with its interpreted maṣdar we get:\n\nعجبت من وقوف بكرٍ [شرح شيخ زاده على قواعد الإعراب 1/177]\nI wondered at Zayd’s being stopped standing.\n\nThe أَنَّ clause can even occur as a base noun. For example:\n\nقَالَ أَيْنَ تُرِيدُ قَالَ أُرِيدُ أَخًا لِي فِي هَذِهِ الْقَرْيَةِ قَالَ هَلْ لَكَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ تَرُبُّهَا قَالَ لاَ غَيْرَ أَنِّي أَحْبَبْتُهُ فِي اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ\n[صحيح مسلم :2567a]\n[He said, “Where are you intending [to go]?” He said, “I intend [to go to] a brother of mine in this town.” He said, “Do you have upon him a favor that [you are seeking repayment for]?” He said, “No, except that I have loved him [for the sake of] Allāh the Exalted and Glorious.”\n\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause as a info\n\nأمرك أنك ذاهب [الجنى الداني 409]\nYour state-of-affairs is that you are going.\n(The interpreted maṣdar ذَهَابُكَ is the info.)\n\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause as a subject\nThe أَنَّ clause as a subject is not as common as the other categories, and has some restrictions. Generally, it won’t begin the sentence. Instead, its info will usually precede it.1 For example:\n\nفي ظني أنك فاضل [الجنى الداني 408]\n[It is] in my estimation that you are excellent.\n(في ظني is analyzed as a fronted info and the interpreted maṣdar construction فَضْلُكَ your excellence is the backed subject.)\nوَمِنۡ ءَایَـٰتِهِۦۤ أَنَّكَ تَرَى ٱلۡأَرۡضَ خَـٰشِعَةࣰ [سورة فصلت 41:39]2\nAnd of His signs is that you see the earth stilled\nأحقا أنك ذاهب [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/205]\n[Is it] really that you are going?\n(The interpreted maṣdar ذَهَابُكَ is the subject. حَقًّا is analyzed as an adverb info.3)\n\n\nThe أَنَّ clause may even be an subject of إِنَّ and كَانَ. Examples:\n\nكان في ظني أنك فاضل [الجنى الداني 408]\n[It] was in my estimation that you are excellent.\n\nAs the subject of إِنَّ, the أَنَّ clause must be separated from إِنَّ:\n\nإن عندي أنك فاضل [الجنى الداني 408]\nIndeed [it is your rank] with me that you are excellent.\ni.e. You are excellent in my sight.\n\nWhen the أَنَّ clause is a governee of كَانَ then it can, in general, be either the subject or the info. For example:\n\nفَكَانَ عَـٰقِبَتَهُمَاۤ أَنَّهُمَا فِی ٱلنَّارِ [سورة الحشر 59:17]\nSo the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire\n(In some recitations عَاقِبَة is in the u-state.4)\n\nCompare also to section (masdar an in kaana chapter).\n\n\n\n30.3.3 The interpreted maṣdar when the info of أَنَّ is a prepositional/adverbial phrase\nConsider the following sentences, where the info of أَنَّ is a prepositional or adverbial phrase:\n\nعجبتُ من أن زيداً عندك [haazimi 24/10]\nI wondered at that Zayd is at [your place].\n(The info of أَنَّ is an adverbial phrase: عِنْدَكَ at your place.)\n\n\n\nعلمت أن زيداً في الدار [haazimi 37/15]\nI knew that Zayd is in the house.\n(The info of أَنَّ is an prepositional phrase: فِي الدَّارِ in the house.)\n\nIn such cases, the interpreted maṣdar is general beingness, represented by the maṣdar كَوْن or اسْتِقْرَار, as below:\n\nعجبت من استقرار زيدٍ عندك [haazimi 24/10]\nI wondered at Zayd’s being at [your place].\nعلمت كون زيد في الدار [haazimi 37/15]\nI knew Zayd’s being in the house.\n\n\n\n30.3.4 The interpreted maṣdar when the info of أَنَّ is a entity noun\nConsider the following sentence, where the info of أَنَّ is a entity noun:\n\nعلمت أن زيداً أسد [haazimi 37/15]\nI knew that Zayd is a lion.\n(The info of أَنَّ is a entity noun: أَسَدٌ a lion.)\n\nIn this case as well, the interpreted maṣdar can be general beingness:\n\nعلمت كون زيد أسداً [haazimi 37/15]\nI knew Zayd’s being a lion.\n\nOr the interpreted maṣdar can be formed from the entity noun, using the suffix ـِيَّة -iyyah (see section (ref)), as below:\n\nعلمت أسدية زيد [haazimi 37/15]\nI knew Zayd’s lion-like-ness.\n\n\n\n30.3.5 Optionally delete the preposition before أَنَّ\nWhen the أَنَّ clause is in the i-state following a preposition, then it is allowed to (optionally) delete the preposition, for the same meaning, as long as the meaning remains clear. So, instead of saying:\n\nعجبت من أنك قائم [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 2/151]\nI wondered at that you are standing.\n\nwe can say:\n\nعجبت أنك قائم [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 2/151]\nI wondered that you are standing.\n\n\n\n\n30.3.6 لِأَنَّ because\nThe preposition لِ when attached before أَنَّ can signify the meaning because.5 For example:\n\nقَالَ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم إِذَا أُتِيَ بِطَعَامٍ أَكَلَ مِنْهُ وَبَعَثَ بِفَضْلِهِ إِلَىَّ وَإِنَّهُ بَعَثَ إِلَىَّ يَوْمًا بِفَضْلَةٍ لَمْ يَأْكُلْ مِنْهَا لأَنَّ فِيهَا ثُومًا فَسَأَلْتُهُ أَحَرَامٌ هُوَ قَالَ لاَ وَلَكِنِّي أَكْرَهُهُ مِنْ أَجْلِ رِيحِهِ [صحيح مسلم :2053]\nHe said, “The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ would, when he was brought some food, eat from it and send its extra to me. And indeed he sent to me, one day, some extra having not eaten from it because in it was some garlic. So I asked him, ‘Is it unlawful?’ He said, ‘No, but I dislike it because of its odor.’”\n\n\n\n\n30.3.7 أَنَّ with the meaning of لَعَلَّ\nAs a niche use, أَنَّ can be used with the meaning of لَعَلَّ (see section (ref) below). For example:\n\nائتِ السوقَ أنكَ تشتري لَنَا شيئا [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 5/178]\nCome to the market [so] that you may buy for us something.\nما أدري أنه صاحبها [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 5/178]\nI don’t know, perhaps he is his companion.",

    "section": "30.10 Word order of the subject and the info with إِنَّ and its sisters",
    "text": "30.10 Word order of the subject and the info with إِنَّ and its sisters\n\n30.10.1 Word order for a single element info\nThe subject of إِنَّ (and its sisters) must always follow it in word order. And its info must always follow the subject. So, for example, we cannot say:\n\n✗ إِنَّ قَائِمٌ زَيْدًا [شرح قطر الندى وبل الصدى 162]\n\nWe must say instead:\n\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ\nIndeed Zayd is standing.\n\n\n\n30.10.2 Word order for a prepositional or adverbial phrase info\nWhen the info is itself (loosely speaking) the prepositional or adverbial phrase, then then it may be placed before the subject. Sometimes, placing the prepositional/adverbial phrase before the subject is optional. For example:\n\nإِنَّ فِي الدَّارِ ضُيُوفًا كِرَامًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/273]\nIndeed in the house are noble guests.\nلَيْتَ عِنْدَكَ مُحَمَّدًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/273]\nO that with you was Muḥammad\n\nIn such cases, where the prepositional/adverbial phrase info may be placed either before or after the subject, the signification can be slightly diferent. For example, if we say:\n\nإِنَّ مَعَكَ صَاحِبَكَ. [Wright 2/80C]\nIndeed, with you, is your companion.\n\nThis puts the logical accent on the subject صَاحِبَكَ “your companion”. If the subject is placed first then this puts the logical accent on the info:\n\nإِنَّ صَاحِبَكَ مَعَكَ. [Wright 2/80C]\nIndeed your companion is with you.\n\nWhen the prepositional/adverbial phrase has a pronoun that refers to the subject, then it must obligatorily be placed before the subject. For example:\n\nإِنَّ فِي الدَّارِ سَاكِنَهَا [ارتشاف الضرب من لسان العرب 3/1244]\nIndeed in the house is its resident.\nإِنَّ عِنْدَ هِنْدٍ بَعْلَهَا [ارتشاف الضرب من لسان العرب 3/1244]\nIndeed with Hind is her husband.\n\n\n\n30.10.3 Word order when the info has a governee\nIf the info has a governee, then the normal word order is for it to follow its governor. For example:\n\nإن زيدا آكل طعامك [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\nIndeed Zayd is eating your food.\n\nOptionally, the governee of the info can be made to precede it. For example:\n\nإن زيدا طعامك آكل [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/317]\nIndeed Zayd is eating your food.\n\nBut the governee of the info should not, in general, precede the subject. So we cannot say:\n\n✗ إن طعامك زيدا آكل [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\n\nHowever, when the governee of the info is a preposition or adverb, then there is some diagreement amongst the grammarians, with regard to whether the governee of the info can precede the subject.10 Some grammarians allowed sentences like:\n\nإِنَّ عِنْدَكَ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\nIndeed with you Zayd is sitting.\nإن بك زيدا واثق [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\nIndeed in you Zayd is trusting.\nإنَّ اليَوْمَ زَيْدًا مُسافِرٌ [البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة هود 11:8]\nIndeed today Zayd is a journeying-one.\nعلمت أن اليوم زيداً سائر [المساعد على تسهيل الفوائد لابن عقيل 3/65]]{.citex}\nI knew that today Zayd is a travelling-one.\n\nOthers disallowed such sentences and mandated that the governee of the info not precede the subject even in the case of preposition or adverb governee.11: So they allow:\n\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ عِنْدَكَ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\nIndeed Zayd is sitting with you.\nإن زيدا واثق بك [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/349]\nIndeed Zayd is trusting in you.\n\nIt is also allowed to make the governee of the info precede it (but not the subject) (as in example (77) above). For example:\n\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا عِنْدَكَ جَالِسٌ,\nإن زيدا بك واثق",

    "section": "30.12 إِنَّ with a لَ of beginning",
    "text": "30.12 إِنَّ with a لَ of beginning\nThe لَ of beginning is a particle which generally occurs in the beginning of a sentence signifies an assertive meaning. For example, if we start with:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nZayd is standing.\n\nthen we can make the sentence more assertive by using لَ of beginning in its beginning:\n\nلَزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ\nIndeed Zayd is standing.\n\nThe لَ of beginning, in sentences without إِنَّ (as above), is placed in the beginning of the sentence and is attached only to the subject. If the info were fronted, we wouldn’t say:\n\n✗ لَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/353]\n\n\n30.12.1 The لَ of beginning placed before the info of إِنَّ\nThis لَ of beginning is frequently found used with إِنَّ. But instead of occurring before إِنَّ thus:\n\n✗ لَإِنَّ\n\nit is placed between the subject of إِنَّ and its info, thus:\n\nإِنَّ زَيْدٌ لَقَائِمٌ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd is standing.\n\nWhen إِنَّ is used together with لَ of beginning as in the example above, then the sentence signifies extra assertion, compared to if had only إِنَّ or only the لَ of beginning.\nIn a similar manner to example () above, we can say:\n\nإن زيدًا لفي الدار [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd is in the house.\n\nThe لَ of beginning has certain restrictions placed on its usage, when used with إِنَّ:\nFirstly, it can only be used with إِنَّ and not with any of its sisters.\nSecondly, the إِنَّ sentence should be an affirmative sentence, not a negative sentence. So we cannot say:\n\n✗ إِنَّ عَلِيًّا لَمَا حَضَرَ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/288]\n\nInstead, we should say (without the لَ of beginning):\n\nإِنَّ عَلِيًّا مَا حَضَرَ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/288]\nIndeed Ɛaliyy was not present.\n\nAdditionally, when the info of إِنَّ is a verbal sentence with a perfect verb, then the لَ of beginning is not attached to the perfect verb. But if قَدْ is used before the perfect verb, then the لَ of beginning may be attached before it. So we cannot say:\n\n✗ إِنَّ الْعِلْمَ لَرَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/288]\n\nBut we can say:\n\nإِنَّ الْعِلْمَ لَقَدْ رَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/288]\nIndeed the knowledge – it has raised the worth of its companion.\n\nOr we can say without both the لَ of beginning and قَدْ\n\nإِنَّ الْعِلْمَ رَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/288]\nIndeed the knowledge – it raised the worth of its companion.\n\nThis restriction is not placed on a ;xabar which is a verbal sentence with a stateful verb. So we can say:\n\nإن زيدًا ليخرج اليوم [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd – he will go out today.\n\nWhen the stateful verb has سَوْفَ, then grammarians have disagreed with regards tp allowing لَ of beginning to attach to it.12(https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1015#p1)]\n\nإن زيدا لسوفَ يقوم [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/354]\nIndeed Zayd – he will soon stand.\n\nAlso, rigid perfect verbs are exempted from being restricted and may be used with لَ of beginning directly. For example:\n\nإنّ زيدًا لنِعْم الرجلُ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd – how excellent the man.\nإنّ عمرًا لِبِئْسَ الغلامُ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd – how wretched the boy.\n\nHowever, لَيْسَ is a rigid verb, but لَ of beginning does not attach to it because of the undesirableness of two لs coming togather. So we won’t say:\n\n✗ إنّ زيدًا لليس بقائم [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/352]\nIndeed Zayd – he is not standing.\n\nWhen a governee of the info is placed before it in word order (but still after the subject), such that it comes between the subject and the info, then لَ of beginning will attach to the fronted governee, thus:\n\nإنّ زيدًا لَفِى الدار قائمٌ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/354]\nIndeed Zayd, in the house is standing.\n\n\n\nإن زيدًا لطعامَكَ آكلٌ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/355]\nIndeed Zayd, your food he is eating.\n\nBut if the governee of the info is placed after the info then the info will have لَ of beginning, not its governee. So we won’t say:\n\n✗ إنَّ زيدًا آكلٌ لطعامكَ [الأصول في النحو لابن السراج 2/235]\n\nInstead, we will say:\n\nإنَّ زيدًا لآكلٌ طعامَكَ [الأصول في النحو لابن السراج 2/235]\nIndeed Zayd is eating your food.\n\nAlso, if the subject has a attribute which occurs between it and the info, then again لَ of beginning is placed with the info. For example:\n\nإِنّ زيدًا الفاضِلَ لَقَائِمٌ [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/355]\nIndeed the excellent Zayd is standing\n\n\n\n30.12.2 The لَ of beginning placed before the subject of إِنَّ\nSo far, we have seen the لَ of beginning attached before the info of إِنَّ. But, if the info occurs before the subject in word order, then لَ of beginning is actually atached before the subject. In this way, لَ of beginning again occurs between the subject and the info. For example:\n\nإن في الدار لزيدا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/373]\nIndeed in the house is Zayd.\n\nIf the info occurs after the subject in word order, but a governee of the info occurs before the subject, then we have two options: لَ of beginning may optionally be attached before the subject or before the info. For example:\n\nإن فيها زيدًا لقائم\nإن فيها لزيدًا قائم\n[شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/357]\nIndeed in it Zayd is standing.\n\n\n\n30.12.3 The لَ of beginning with a separating-pronoun\nIf a separating-pronoun occurs between the subject and the info of إِنَّ, and a لَ of beginning is to be used, then the لَ of beginning will be attached before the separating-pronoun. For example, if we start with:\n\nإن زيدًا هو القائم [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/357]\nIndeed Zayd is the standing one.\n\nand we add لَ of beginning, we get:\n\nإن زيدًا لَهو القائم [شرح ألفية ابن مالك للشاطبي 2/357]\nIndeed Zayd is the standing one.",

    "section": "30.13 When to use إِنَّ vs أَنَّ",
    "text": "30.13 When to use إِنَّ vs أَنَّ\n\n30.13.1 The basic principle\nThe basic principle in choosing whether to use إِنَّ vs أَنَّ is:\n\nإِنَّ is used to begin a complete sentence. As a complete sentence, it can then be a part of an larger sentence.\nأَنَّ is used to begin a clause which is part of a larger sentence. The larger sentence, in order for its meaning to work, requires a maṣdari interpretation of the أَنَّ clause.\n\nIn theory, this is a pretty clear demarcation. But in practice it can be a little tricky to tell when to use إِنَّ vs أَنَّ. Let’s work through some examples:\n\nنُطْقِي اللَّهُ حَسْبِي\n[Wright 2/256D, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/204, previously cited in section (ref)]\nMy utterance is “Allāh is sufficient for me.”\n\nIn the example above,  the sentence info اللَّهُ حَسْبِي Allāh is sufficient for me, is simply being reported as speech. It’s not an interpreted maṣdar of the info which is expressing a property about the subject نُطْقِي. Rather, the info, as a complete sentence, is the complement of the subject. So it can begin with إِنَّ but not أَنَّ, thus: نُطْقِي إِنَّ اللَّهُ حَسْبِي.\nHere are a couple more examples:\n\nخَيْرُ الْقَوْلِ إِنِّي أَحْمَدُ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/355]\nThe best of speech is: Indeed I praise.\nقَوْلِي إِنَّهُ فَاضِلٌ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 1/325]\nMy saying is: Indeed he is excellent.\n\nBut if the info expresses a property about the subject, not as a complete sentence, but as an interpreted maṣdar, then أَنَّ is used. For example:\n\nاعْتِقَادِي أَنَّهُ فَاضِلٌ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 1/325]\nMy belief is that he is excellent.\n(i.e. اعْتِقَادِي فَضْلُهُ My belief is his being excellent.)\n\nIn the example above, it is not exactly the sentence هُوَ فَاضِلٌ “he is excellent” which is my belief. Rather my belief is his being excellent.\nHere are some more examples of a complete sentence with إِنَّ in a larger sentence. In all the examples, the إِنَّ sentence is part of the larger sentence, as is. It does not need to be interpreted as a maṣdar construction.\n\nزَيْدٌ إِنَّهُ فَاضِلٌ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 1/324]\nZayd – indeed he is excellent.\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ إِنَّهُ فَاضِلٌ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 1/323]\nI passed by a indeed-he-is-excellent man.\n(The sentence إِنَّهُ فَاضِلٌ is the attribute of رَجُل.)\nأَحْتَرِمُ الَّذِي إِنَّهُ مُخُلِصٌ فِي عَمَلِهِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/275]\nI respect the one who – indeed he is sincere in his work.\n(The إِنَّ sentence إِنَّهُ مُخُلِصٌ فِي عَمَلِهِ is the connecting sentence of the connected noun الَّذِي. See chapter (ref).)\nجِئْتُ وَإِنَّ الشَّمْسَ تَغْرُبُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/276]\nI came while the sun was setting.\n(The إِنَّ sentence جِئْتُ وَإِنَّ الشَّمْسَ تَغْرُبُ is a ḥāl. See chapter (ref).)\n\nNow let’s again consider some tricky areas:\n\n\n30.13.2 When إِنَّ or أَنَّ occur as a base noun\nConsider the following sentence:\n\nاجْلِسْ حَيْثُ إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/355]\nSit where – indeed Zayd is sitting.\n\nIn the above example حَيْثُ is an adverb of place (see chapter (ref)) which is a annexe noun to the sentence-base noun إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ. The إِنَّ sentence does not require the maṣdari interpretation جُلُوس for the meaning to work.\nNow consider this sentence:\n\nقَالَ كَعْبُ بْنُ مَالِكٍ لَمْ أَتَخَلَّفْ عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي غَزْوَةٍ غَزَاهَا قَطُّ إِلاَّ فِي غَزْوَةِ تَبُوكَ غَيْرَ أَنِّي قَدْ تَخَلَّفْتُ فِي غَزْوَةِ بَدْرٍ … [صحيح مسلم :2769a]\nKaɛb ibn Mālik said, “I didn’t remain behind the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ in any expedition that he went on, ever, except in the expedition of Tabūk, other than that I remained behind in the expedition of Badr …\n\nIn this example, the أَنَّ clause أَنِّي قَدْ تَخَلَّفْتُ is base noun of غَيْرَ. أَنَّ is used instead of إِنَّ because, in order for the meaning to work, the maṣdar of تَخَلَّفَ is interpreted, thus: غَيْرَ تَخَلُّفِي other than my remaining behind.\n\n\n30.13.3 In reported speech\nWhen a sentence is reported as (direct or indirect) speech, then إِنَّ is used instead of أَنَّ in the beginning of the reported speech. (By the way, direct speech can also begin without إِنَّ.) Here are examples with إِنَّ:\n\nتُعَيّرنا أنَّا قليلٌ عَدِيدنا فقلتُ لها إنّ الكرام قليلُ [النحو الوافي 1/650]\nShe reproaches us that we – our number is few. So I said to her, “Indeed the noble are few.”\nفَقِيلَ لَهَا إِنَّهُ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم [صحيح البخاري :1283]\nThen it was said to her Indeed he is the Prophet ﷺ\n\nIn the following example, the pronoun in إِنَّهَا indicates indirect speech, yet still إِنَّ is used instead of أَنَّ:\n\nقَالَتْ إِنَّهَا حُبْلَى مِنَ الزِّنَا [صحيح مسلم :1695a]\nShe said that she had become pregnant as a result of fornication.\n\nThe reason for using إِنَّ instead of أَنَّ is, again, that that the reported speech is not interpreted as a maṣdar in order to connect it to the verb قَالَ before it. Rather, the entire reported speech is, as is, the direct doee of the verb قَالَ.\nWith other verbs that may indicate reported speech, أَنَّ is typically used. For example:\n\nصَلَّى بِنَا سَعِيدُ بْنُ جُبَيْرٍ بِجَمْعٍ الْمَغْرِبَ ثَلاَثًا بِإِقَامَةٍ ثُمَّ سَلَّمَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى الْعِشَاءَ رَكْعَتَيْنِ ثُمَّ ذَكَرَ أَنَّ عَبْدَ اللَّهِ بْنَ عُمَرَ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ وَذَكَرَ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ [سنن النسائي :483]\nSa’eed bin Jubair led us in prayer in Jam’. (He prayed) Maghrib, three Rak’ahs with an Iqamah, then he prayed ‘Isha’, two Rak’ahs. Then he mentioned that ’Abdullah bin ’Umar had done that, and he mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had done that.\n\nThe reason is that now, the maṣdari meaning of the speech is interpreted as the direct doee of ذَكَرَ. That is, he mentioned [#3abd] Allāh’s doing that.\nOcassionally, we will find أَنَّ used with قَالَ. And that is when قَالَ is not simply reporting speech, but signifying the speaker’s belief, estimation, or claim of the maṣdari content of the following speech.13 For example:\n\nأتقول المراصدُ أن الجو بارد فى الأسبوع المقبل [النحو الوافي 1/650]\nDoes the forecaster say that the weather is cold in the upcoming week?\n(i.e. Does the forecaster estimate the weather to be cold …)\n\n\n\n30.13.4 After verbs of perception\nAfter, verbs of perception (see chapter (ref), if a sentence suspends its government (see section (ref)), then either إِنَّ or أَنَّ may be used. For example:\n\nعلمت إن الرياءَ بلاءٌ\nعلمت أَن الرياءَ بلاءٌ\n[النحو الوافي 1/651]\nI knew that showing off is a trial.\n\nIf لَ of beginning is used, then, of course; it would only be used with إِنَّ not أَنَّ. For example:\n\nعلمت إن الإسراف لطريق الفقر [النحو الوافي 1/651]\nI knew indeed extravagance is the path to poverty.\n\n\n\n30.13.5 After إِذَا or suddenness\nAfter إِذَا or suddenness (see chapter (ref)), either إِنَّ or أَنَّ may be used14:\n\nخرجت فإذا إن زيدا قائم\nخرجت فإذا أن زيدا قائم\n[شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/356]\nI came out [and] suddenly Zayd was standing.\n\n\n\n30.13.6 After an oath\nالنحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 278\nالنحو الوافي 1/650\n\n\n30.13.7 After ف in a condition-response\nWhen the condition-response begins with a فَ, either إِنَّ or أَنَّ (or neither) may be used.15 For example:\n\nإِنْ تَجْتَهِدْ فَإِنَّكَ/فَأَنَّكَ نَاجِحٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/279]\nIf you exert yourself then you will be successful.",

We will treat the rest of the lightened particles in subsequent sections, if Allāh wills.\n\n30.15.1 Governance of the lightened إِنْ\nThe lightened إِنْ is less assertive in meaning than the heavy إِنَّ.17. In using it there are two optional possibilities:\nThe first, and more common, option is that the lightened leaves the state of its subject in the u-state, just like a basic nounal sentence. But now, a لَ is almost always required. For example:\n\nإِنْ سَعِيدٌ لَمُجْتَهِدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/296–297]\nIndeed Saɛīd is an exerter [of himself].\n\nNote that the subject سَعِيدٌ is in the u-state, and that a لَ is used with the info: لَمُجْتَهِدٌ. This لَ is now called the differentiator لَ, because it differentiates the lightened إِنْ from another type of إِنْ called the negating-إِنْ (see chapter (ref)).  Occasionally, when the meaning is clear without it, the differentiator لَ may be omitted.18 For example:\n\nإِنِ الْعَاقِلُ يَتَّبِعُ سَبِيلَ الرَّشَادِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nIndeed the sensible one follows the path of right conduct.\n\nThe second, and less commonly used, option is for the lightened إِنْ to govern its subject in the a-state, just like the heavy إِنَّ. Now the لَ (called لَ of beginning again) is optional, as it was with إِنَّ. Examples:\n\nإِنْ سَعِيدًا مُجْتَهِدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nIndeed Saɛīd is an exerter [of himself].\nوَإِنَّ كُلࣰّا لَّمَّا لَیُوَفِّیَنَّهُمۡ رَبُّكَ أَعۡمَـٰلَهُمۡۚ [سورة هود 11:111 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nAnd indeed, each [of the believers and disbelievers] - your Lord will fully compensate them for their deeds.\n\n\n\n30.15.2 A verbal sentence after the lightened إِنْ\nUnlike the heavy إِنَّ, the lightened إِنْ can be followed directly by a verb. But the verb that follows it is usually constrained to be a canceling verb. Examples:\n\nوَإِن كَانَتۡ لَكَبِیرَةً إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلَّذِینَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُۗ [سورة البقرة 2:143 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nAnd indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allāh has guided.\nقَالَ تَٱللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرۡدِینِ [سورة الصافات 37:56 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nHe will say, “By Allāh, you almost ruined me.\nوَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلۡكَـٰذِبِینَ [سورة الشعراء 26:186 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/297]\nand indeed, we think you are among the liars.\nوَإِن یَكَادُ ٱلَّذِینَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَیُزۡلِقُونَكَ بِأَبۡصَـٰرِهِمۡ [سورة القلم 68:51 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/298]\nAnd indeed, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes [i.e., looks]\n\nRarely, a non-canceling verb is found to occur after the lightened إِنْ. For example:\n\nإِنْ قَتَلْتَ لَمُسْلِمًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/298, شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/382]\nIndeed you killed a Muslim\n\nThe analysis of this sentence is that the subject of the lightened إِنْ is implicated to be a deleted state-of-affairs pronoun. And the verb which follows with its governees is a sentence which is the info of the lightened إِنْ.19",

    "text": "30.16 The lightened أَنْ\n\n30.16.1 Governance of the lightened أَنْ\nThe lightened أَنْ retains the governance of the the heavy إِنَّ.20 But its subject is (almost) always a deleted state-of-affairs pronoun. And its info is then a complete sentence. For example:\n\nعلمت أن زيد قائم [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/383]\nI knew that [the state-of-affairs is:] Zayd is standing.\n\nNote, in the above example, that زَيدٌ is in the u-state because it is the subject of an independent sentence زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ. The subject of أَنْ is a deleted state-of-affairs pronoun, implicated thus: أَنْهُ.\nOccasionally, the subject the lightened أَنْ is not deleted, in which case it won’t be a state-of-affairs pronoun.21 In this case the info may either be a single noun or a complete sentence.22\n\nأظنُّ أنْكَ قائمٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/552]\nI estimate that you are standing.\nأحسبُ أنْهُ ذاهبٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/552]\nI deem that he is going.\n\nBut most of the time, the subject of the lightened أَنْ will be a deleted state-of-affairs pronoun, and its info will be a sentence. The sentence which is the info of this lightened أَنْ can begin either with a noun or with a verb.\nWhen it begins with a noun, then it does not need any separation between it and the أَنْ. For example:\n\nوَءَاخِرُ دَعۡوَىٰهُمۡ أَنِ ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَـٰلَمِینَ [سورة يونس 10:10 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 301]\nAnd the last of their call will be, “Praise to Allāh, Lord of the worlds!”\n\nSimilarly, if the sentence info begins with a primitive verb, then again no separation is needed between it and the أَنْ. For example:\n\nوَأَن لَّیۡسَ لِلۡإِنسَـٰنِ إِلَّا مَا سَعَىٰ [سورة النجم 53:39]\nAnd that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives\nأَوَلَمۡ یَنظُرُوا۟ فِی مَلَكُوتِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَ ٰ⁠تِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَیۡءࣲ وَأَنۡ عَسَىٰۤ أَن یَكُونَ قَدِ ٱقۡتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمۡۖ [سورة الأعراف 7:185 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 301]\nDo they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that Allāh has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near?\n\nBut if the verb is flexible, then it is preferred that it be separated from the lightened أَنْ by one of the following:\n\nقَدْ. For example:\n\nقَالُوا۟ نُرِیدُ أَن نَّأۡكُلَ مِنۡهَا وَتَطۡمَىِٕنَّ قُلُوبُنَا وَنَعۡلَمَ أَن قَدۡ صَدَقۡتَنَا وَنَكُونَ عَلَیۡهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّـٰهِدِینَ [سورة المائدة 5:113 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 301]\nThey said, “We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses.”\n\nThe particles سَ or سَوْفَ. For example:\n\nعَلِمَ أَن سَیَكُونُ مِنكُم مَّرۡضَىٰ [سورة المزمل 73:20 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/301]\n\nOne of the particle of negation لَا, لَنْ, or لَمْ\n\nأَفَلَا یَرَوۡنَ أَلَّا یَرۡجِعُ إِلَیۡهِمۡ قَوۡلࣰا [سورة طه 20:89 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/302]\nأَیَحۡسَبُ أَن لَّمۡ یَرَهُۥۤ أَحَدٌ [سورة البلد 90:7 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/302]\nأَیَحۡسَبُ ٱلۡإِنسَـٰنُ أَلَّن نَّجۡمَعَ عِظَامَهُۥ [سورة المزمل 73:3 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/302]\n\nIn (non-Qurʾānic) sca, أَنْ is not joined in writing to the following particle. So we will write أَنْ لَا23, أَنْ لَنْ, and أَنْ لَمْ. But in pronunciation, the ن is assimilated with the ل, as usual, so we will say ʾallā, ʾallan, and ʾallam, respectively. For example:\n\n\nتَيَقَّنْتُ أَنْ لاَ أُسَافِرُ [النحو الوافي 4/298]\nI was sure that I will not journey.\n\n\nThe conditional particle لَوْ For example:\n\nوَأَلَّوِ ٱسۡتَقَـٰمُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلطَّرِیقَةِ لَأَسۡقَیۡنَـٰهُم مَّاۤءً غَدَقࣰا [سورة الجن 72:16 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/302]\n\n\n\n\n30.16.2 When to use the lightened أَنْ vs the a-state-izing أَنْ\nWhen أَنْ is to be followed by a stateful verb (whether or not separated by a particle like لَا), then the question is should we use the lightened أَنْ or the a-state-izing أَنْ?\nIf we choose the lightened أَنْ, then the stateful verb is put in the u-state. For example:\n\nعَلِمْتُ أَنْ لاَ يَخْرُجُ زَيْدٌ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/553]\nI knew that Zayd will not go out.\n\nAnd if we choose the a-state-izing أَنْ, then the stateful verb is put in the u-state. For example:\n\nاشْتَهَيْتُ أَنْ لاَ يَخْرُجَ زَيْدٌ [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/406]24\nI desired that Zayd not go out.\n\nThe general principle is that the lightened أَنْ is used when the verb before it signifies certainty, like عَلِمَ to know. This is because it is the lightened from the heavy أَنَّ, which is used assertively.\nAs for the a-state-izing أَنْ, it is used when the verb before it signfies a wanting for something to happen, or a fearing that something not happen. Here are some examples that can illustrate this:\n\nعَلِمْتُ أَنْ سَيَخْرُجُ زَيْدٌ [modified from شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI knew that Zayd will go out.\nأَرْجُو أَنْ تُحْسِنَ إِلَيََّ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI hope that you will do good to me.\nأَخَافُ أَنْ تُسِيءَ إِلَيََّ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI fear that you will do evil to me.\n\nThere are a class of verbs that vary in the amount of certainty or wanting that they signify. Such verbs include: ظَنَّ to conjecture, حَسِبَ to deem, خَالَ to imagine, رَأَىٰ to opine, etc. In this context, they can be translated in idiomatic English as to think. Furthermore, the perfect verb can be used where in Eng;ish we would use the present tense (in accordance with what we learned in section (madi used for moment of utterance)).\nWith such verbs, both the lightened أَنْ (and therefore also the heavy أَنَّ), and the a-state-izing أَنْ can be used. In theory, the lightened أَنْ (and the heavy أَنَّ) is used when the speaker believes the following statement to be true.25\nFor example:\n\nظَنَنْتُ أَنَّكَ تَخْرُجُ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI [believe] that you are going out.\nor I [believe] that you will go out.\nظَنَنْتُ أَنْ سَتَخْرُجُ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI [believe] that you will go out.\nحسبت أن زيدا منطلق [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/406]\nI [believe] that Zayd is setting out.\nظننت أنك أخونا [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/406]\nI [believe] that you are our brother.\nقَدْ حَسِبْتُ أَنْ لَا تَقُولُ ذَلِكَ [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/406]\nI [believe] that you will not say that.\nأَرَىٰ أَنْ سَيَفْعَلُ [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/407]\nI [believe] that he will do [it].\n\nConversely, the a-state-izing أَنْ is used when the the speaker feels the following statement, without any strong evidence or indicator which is guiding his feeling.26\n\nظننت أن تَخْرُجَ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nI [feel] that you will go out.\nظَنَنْتُ أَنْ لاَ تَفْعَلَ [شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/407]\nI [feel] that you will not do [it]\n\nDespite this theoretical difference between the two uses, practically, the a-state-izing أَنْ is used more commonly in such situations because it is the default.27\nWhen أَنْ is followed directly be a perfect verb (without an intervening قَدْ), then it seems that the أَنْ is a-state-izing (despite their being no effect of the a-state-izing أَنْ on the perfect verb). This is because the lightened أَنْ would have required قَدْ.28 For example:\n\nكرِهتُ أن قمتَ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 5/97]\nI disliked that you stood.\n\nWe list the following examples to illustrate the range of أَنْ.\n\nتَظُنُّ أَن یُفۡعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةࣱ [سورة القيامة 75:25 cited by شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/407]\nفَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَیۡهِمَاۤ أَن یَتَرَاجَعَاۤ إِن ظَنَّاۤ أَن یُقِیمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِۗ [سورة البقرة 2:230 cited by شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/407]\nوَحَسِبُوۤا۟ أَلَّا تَكُونَ فِتۡنَةࣱ [سورة المائدة 5:71 cited by شرح كتاب سيبويه للسيرافي 3/407; شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nAnd they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment\n(Some recitations have the verb following أَنْ in the u-state.29)\nأَیَحۡسَبُ أَن لَّمۡ یَرَهُۥۤ أَحَدٌ [سورة البلد 90:7 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nعَلِمَ أَن سَیَكُونُ مِنكُم مَّرۡضَىٰ [سورة المزمل 73:20 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nأَفَلَا یَرَوۡنَ أَلَّا یَرۡجِعُ إِلَیۡهِمۡ قَوۡلࣰا [سورة طه 20:89 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nوَٱلَّذِیۤ أَطۡمَعُ أَن یَغۡفِرَ لِی خَطِیۤـَٔتِی یَوۡمَ ٱلدِّینِ [سورة الشعراء 26:82 cited by شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/554]\nوَأَنَا أَرْجُو أَنْ يُبَرِّئَنِي اللَّهُ، وَلَكِنْ وَاللَّهِ مَا ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يُنْزِلَ فِي شَأْنِي وَحْيًا [صحيح البخاري :2661]\nفَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَفَخِذُهُ عَلَى فَخِذِي فَثَقُلَتْ عَلَىَّ حَتَّى ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ سَتُرَضُّ فَخِذِي [سنن النسائي :3099]\nوَحَسِبْتُ أَنْ قَدْ قَالَ وَالرَّجُلُ رَاعٍ فِي مَالِ أَبِيهِ [صحيح البخاري :2751]\nوَاعْلَمُوا أَنْ لَنْ يُدْخِلَ أَحَدَكُمْ عَمَلُهُ الْجَنَّةَ [صحيح البخاري :6464]\nعَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ ﷺ قَالَ سَأَلْتُ اللَّهَ مَسْأَلَةً وَدِدْتُ أَنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ سَأَلْتُهُ ذَكَرْتُ رُسُلَ رَبِّي فَقُلْتُ يَا رَبِّ سَخَّرْتَ لِسُلَيْمَانَ الرِّيحَ وَكَلَّمْتَ مُوسَى فَقَالَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى أَلَمْ أَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَآوَيْتُكَ وَضَالًّا فَهَدَيْتُكَ وَعَائِلًا فَأَغْنَيْتُكَ؟ قَالَ فَقُلْتُ نَعَمْ فَوَدِدْتُ أَنْ لَمْ أَسْأَلْهُ [https://hadithunlocked.com/hakim:3944]\nتَمَنَّيْتُ أَنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ أَسْلَمْتُ قَبْلَ ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ [صحيح مسلم :96b]\nوَدِدْتُ أَنِّي نَجَوْتُ مِنْهَا كَفَافًا لاَ لِي وَلاَ عَلَىَّ [صحيح البخاري :7218]\nإِنِّي وَدِدْتُ أَنْ أَتَخَلَّصَ مِنْهَا لَا عَلَيَّ وَلَا لِي [https://hadithunlocked.com/ibnhibban:4478]\nمَا زَالَ بِكُمْ صَنِيعُكُمْ حَتَّى ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ سَتُكْتَبَ عَلَيْكُمْ [سنن أبي داود :1447]30\nفَزَعَمْتَ أَنْ قَدْ فَعَلَ [صحيح البخاري :2940]\nفَخَرَرْتُ سَاجِدًا وَعَرَفْتُ أَنْ قَدْ جَاءَ فَرَجٌ [صحيح مسلم :2769a]\nSo I fell down prostrating and I knew that a relief had come.\nثُمَّ يُخَلِّلُ بِيَدِهِ شَعَرَهُ، حَتَّى إِذَا ظَنَّ أَنْ قَدْ أَرْوَى بَشَرَتَهُ، أَفَاضَ عَلَيْهِ الْمَاءَ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ [صحيح البخاري :272]\nThen he [would] get the water in the interstices of his hair with his hand until when he thought that he had wettened his skin, he poured on it water three times.",

    "text": "31.2 The essential significance of the doer participle\nThe doer participle is derived from a verb. For example, the doer participle منطلق is derived from the verb انطلق ينطلق to set out. The essential significance of the doer participle is that its referent can be described as the doer of the action of its verb. Consider the example:\n\nزيد منطلق [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 486 citing الجرجاني] Zayd is a setter out.\n\nIn example () above منطلق essentially signifies that its referent زيد can be described as one who sets out. As opposed to the doer participle, the essential significance of the stateful verb is the dynamic execution of the action of the verb. For example:\n\nزيد ينطلق [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 486 citing الجرجاني] Zayd is setting out.\nor Zayd sets out.\nor Zayd will set out.\n\nIn example () above, the stateful verb ينطلق indicates the dynamic action of setting out.\nHere is another example of a doer participle used to signify the doer of a verb. This time the doer participle is from a transitive noun and is governing a direct doee.\n\nوَأَنَا مُتَّبِعٌ فِي ذَلِكَ قَضَاءَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي مَرْيَمَ الْمَغَالِيَّةِ [سنن النسائي :3498]\nI am a follower, in that [matter], of the ruling of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ concerning Maryam al-Mag͡hāliyyah.\n\n\nIn the following sections, we will see that the doer participle, while retaining its essential significance of describing its referent as the doer of a verb, can also signify the meaning of the verb from which it is described. So it can signify the occurrence of the action of the verb and its tense.\nFor example, (1) زيد منطلق can be used in place of (2) زيد ينطلق to mean Zayd is setting out, or Zayd sets out, or Zayd will sets out.",

    "section": "31.3 The doer participle without ٱلْ used to indicate a imperfect static state",
    "text": "31.3 The doer participle without ٱلْ used to indicate a imperfect static state\nWhen we consider a verbal action, it can, in general, have a static and a dynamic perspective The dynamic perspective of looking at a verbal action focuses on the dynamic activity of the doer as he undertakes the verbal action. So, for example, if someone is eating, then the dynamic perspective of looking at this activity is considering the doer’s action of lifting his hand from his plate to his mouth, chewing, swallowing, etc.\nThe static perspective of looking at a verbal action focuses more on fact that the person can be described as being in a state of doing the action. And not so much on the actual activity involved. So, the static perspective of considering someone eating is simply that the person was in a state where he can be described as eating.\nSome verbs, just from their meaning, tend to be more dynamic than others. For example: جَرَى to run, أَكَلَ to eat, etc.\nOther verbs are inherently more static. For example: جَلَسَ to sit, نَامَ to sleep, etc.\nSome verbs have, inherently, both a dynamic and a static meaning. For example, لَبِسَ can mean both: to put on a garment, and also to remain clothed in the garment.. Even static verbs can have a dynamic component. For example, جَلَسَ can mean both: to enter into a seated state (from another position like standing, etc.), and also to remain in a seated state.\n\n\n\n\nAs a general trend, the doer participle is used to indicate a static state. In contrast to the doer participle, the stateful verb indicates that the doer is doing a dynamic action.\nBy the way, when we say “static state” we mean it semantically. The state or condition of an entity can also be indicated syntactically using the ḥāl (see chapter (ref)). These two (semantic and syntactic) aspects of indicating being in a state are often combined. So, we will see from the examples in this section that the doer participle is often (but not always) either a ḥāl, or part of a ḥāl sentence.\nConsider the following example:\n\nكُنْتُ مُسَافِرًا فَأَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ يَأْكُلُ وَأَنَا صَائِمٌ [سنن النسائي :2281]\n“I was traveling and I came to the Prophet while he was eating and I was fasting.”\n\nThe verb يَأْكُلُ indicates a dynamic activity, where the doer is actively eating. Whereas the doer participle صَائِم calls attention to the doer’s being in a (static) state of fasting, and not to his actively doing the activity of fasting.\nEven when a verb that is associated with a dynamic activity, its doer participle can be used instead of the verb when the purpose is to indicate the doer’s being in a state of doing the activity, rather than to indicate the dynamic activity of the verb. For example:\n\nفَلَبِثَ الْأَوْسُ وَالْخَزْرَجُ مُتَحَارِبِينَ عِشْرِينَ سَنَةً فِي أَمْرِ سُمَيْرٍ [marmor 134]\n“So al-ʾAws and al-K͡hazraj stayed (in a state of) fighting each other for twenty years because of the matter of Sumayr.”\nفَمَا الَّذِي أَنْتَ فِيهِ الْآنَ مُجْمِعٌ [marmor 99A]\n“So what is it that you are now (in a state of being) decided about?\n\nHere are some more examples of the the doer participle being used to indicate being in a static state:\n\nلَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمَ أُحُدٍ انْهَزَمَ النَّاسُ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَأَبُو طَلْحَةَ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مُجَوِّبٌ عَلَيْهِ بِحَجَفَةٍ لَهُ [صحيح البخاري :4064]\n“When it was the day of Uḥud, the people left the Prophet ﷺ while Abū Ṭalḥah was in front of the Prophet ﷺ, shielding him with a leather shield of his.”\nفَخَرَجَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ مُشْتَمِلٌ عَلَى شَيْءٍ [جامع الترمذي :3769]\n“So the Prophet ﷺ came out while he was (in a state of) covering something [with his garment].”\nوَإِذَا هُوَ مُعْتَمِدٌ عَلَى عَصًا فِي صَلاَتِهِ فَقُلْنَا بَعْدَ أَنْ سَلَّمْنَا . فَقَالَ حَدَّثَتْنِي أُمُّ قَيْسٍ بِنْتُ مِحْصَنٍ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَمَّا أَسَنَّ وَحَمَلَ اللَّحْمَ اتَّخَذَ عَمُودًا فِي مُصَلاَّهُ يَعْتَمِدُ عَلَيْهِ [سنن أبي داود :948]\n“And incidentally, he was resting on a staff in his prayer. We [asked] him (about resting on the staff) after we had given the salutation; He said: Umm Qays daughter of Miḥṣan said to me that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ became aged and the flesh grew increasingly on him, he took a prop at his place of prayer and he would rest on it.”\n(Note how the doer participle مُعْتَمِد indicates a state and the stateful verb يَعْتَمِدُ indicates the activity.”\nفَبَيْنَا أَنَا نَازِلٌ تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ إِذَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم [موطأ مالك :48]\nWhile I was in a dismounted state under a tree, the Messenger of Allah [came]\nإِذَا مَرِضَ الْعَبْدُ أَوْ سَافَرَ، كُتِبَ لَهُ مِثْلُ مَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ مُقِيمًا صَحِيحًا [صحيح البخاري :56]\nWhen a slave journeys or falls ill, a [similar reward] is written for him as what he used to do while staying (i.e. not journeying) [and] healthy.\nإِنَّ أُمِّي قَدِمَتْ وَهْىَ رَاغِبَةٌ [صحيح البخاري :5979]\nMy mother has arrived and she is desirous (of my favor).\n\n\n31.3.1 The direct doee of the doer participle when indicating a static state\nWhen the doer participle is dervied from a transitive verb, then the doer participle, when indicating a static state, may take a direct doee (as long as it satisifes the conditions specified in section (ref)). For example:\n\nمَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ مُلْتَمِسًا لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ فَلْيَلْتَمِسْهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ وِتْرًا [مسند أحمد :298]\n“Whoever amongst you is seeking the Night of Decree, then let him seek it in the last ten days of Ramaḍān, [in the] the odd [nights].”\n(Note the the doer participle مُلْتَمِسًا has a direct doee لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ.)\nإِنَّهُ كَانَ يُصَلِّي وَهُوَ مُسْبِلٌ إِزَارَهُ [سنن أبي داود :638, graded weak by al-ʾAlbāni]\n“Indeed he was praying while trailing his lower garment.”\nوَوَقَفْتُ عِنْدَ بَابِ عَائِشَةَ فَإِذَا هُوَ مُسْتَقْبِلٌ الْمَغْرِبَ [الأدب المفرد :451]\n“And I stopped at the door of Ɛāʾis͡hah and incidentally, it was facing the west.”\nكَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم حَامِلَ الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ عَلَى عَاتِقِهِ [جامع الترمذي :3784]\n“The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was carrying al-Ḥasan ibn Ɛaliyy on his shoulder”\n(حَامِلَ الْحَسَنِ is a superficial annexation.)\nأَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ يُصَلِّي وَهُوَ حَامِلٌ أُمَامَةَ [سنن النسائي :1204]\n“that the Messenger of Allah used to pray while he [was] carrying Umāmah”\nأَنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ اسْتَأْذَنَ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ لاَبِسٌ مِرْطَ عَائِشَةَ [صحيح مسلم :2402a]\n“that Abū Bakr sought permission from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ [for entrance in his apartment] while he was lying on his bed having on him Ɛāʾis͡hah’s bed-sheet.”\n\nHowever, when the main intent is to indicate the state of the doer independent of the action of the doer upon any doee, then the doer participle can occur without a direct doee. For example:\n\nقَالَ عُثْمَانُ أَجَلْ وَلَكِنَّا كُنَّا خَائِفِينَ [مسند أحمد :431]\nƐut͡hman said, “Yes, but we were in a state of fear.”\n\nIn such cases, the doer participle can be followed with a verb (typically its own), specifying the direct doee. For example:\n\nفَخَرَجْنَا خَائِفِينَ نَخَافُ الرَّصَدَ [maghazi 28 cited by Marmorstein, M., Tense and text in Classical Arabic 138]\n“So we set out afraid, fearing ambush.”\nوَرُزَيْقٌ عَامِلٌ عَلَى أَرْضٍ يَعْمَلُهَا [صحيح البخاري :893]\n“Ruzayq was (in a state of) working on the land, working (i.e. farming) it.”\n\n\n\n\n31.3.2 The doer participle for verbs of posture\nVerbs of posture inlude: جَلَسَ to sit, قَامَ to stand, اضْطَجَعَ to lie down, etc.\nWith such verbs, the stateful verb, when used for the present or past, tends to be used only for the habitual tense and not for the continuous tense. So if we say يَجْلِسُ زَيْدٌ then it will usually mean Zayd sits and not Zayd is sitting.\nFor the continuous tense, only the doer participle tends to be used. So, in order to say Zayd is sitting we will usually say زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ.\nHere are some examples of the doer participle and stateful verb for verbs of posture:\n\nThe doer participle for verbs of posture indicating the continuous tense\n\nرَأَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مُقْعِيًا يَأْكُلُ تَمْرًا [صحيح مسلم :2044a]\n“I saw the Prophet ﷺ squatting, eating dates.”\nقَالَ كُنْتُ مُتَّكِئًا عِنْدَ عَائِشَةَ [صحيح مسلم :177a]\n“I was resting at [the house of] Ɛāʾis͡hah”\nلاَ أُلْفِيَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ مُتَّكِئًا عَلَى أَرِيكَتِهِ … [سنن أبي داود :4605]\n“Let me not find one of you reclining on his couch …”\nأَنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ اسْتَأْذَنَ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ لَابِسٌ مِرْطَ عَائِشَةَ [مسند أحمد :514]\n“that Abū Bakr sought permission from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ [for entrance in his apartment] while he was lying on his bed having on him Ɛāʾis͡hah’s bed-sheet.”\nكُنْتُ جَالِسًا عِنْدَ مُعَاوِيَةَ، فَحَدَّثَ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ انْتَبَهَ [الأدب المفرد :564]\n“I was sitting with Muɛāwiyah when he [muttered to] himself, then he came to his senses.”\nإِنِّي لَجَالِسٌ مَعَ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ وَأَبِي مُوسَى وَهُمَا يَتَحَدَّثَانِ [صحيح مسلم :2672d]\nI was sitting with Ɛabd Allāh and Abū Mūsā while they were talking to each other.\nسَقَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنْ زَمْزَمَ فَشَرِبَ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ [صحيح مسلم :2027a]\nI served the Messenger of Allah some Zamzam and he drank (it) while he was standing.\nهَلْ كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يُصَلِّي وَهُوَ قَاعِدٌ [صحيح مسلم :732a]\nDid the Prophet ﷺ pray while he was sitting?\n\n\n\nThe stateful verb for for verbs of posture indicating the habitual tense\n\nتِلْكَ صَلاَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ يَجْلِسُ يَرْقُبُ الشَّمْسَ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَتْ بَيْنَ قَرْنَىِ الشَّيْطَانِ قَامَ فَنَقَرَ أَرْبَعًا لاَ يَذْكُرُ اللَّهَ فِيهَا إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً [جامع الترمذي :160]\nThat is the prayer of the hypocrite. He sits watching the sun, until when it is between the horns of the devil he stands and pecks out four (units of prayer), not remembering Allah in them but a little.”\nكُنْتُ أَقْعُدُ مَعَ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، يُجْلِسُنِي عَلَى سَرِيرِهِ [صحيح البخاري :53]\nI used to sit with Ibn Ɛabbās and he would seat me on his couch.\nكَانَ جِذْعٌ يَقُومُ إِلَيْهِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم [صحيح البخاري :918]\n[There] was a stem (of a date palm) [which] the Prophet ﷺ would stand against.\nوَيَرْكَعُ رَكْعَتَيْنِ قَبْلَ صَلاَةِ الْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ يَضْطَجِعُ عَلَى شِقِّهِ الأَيْمَنِ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَهُ الْمُؤَذِّنُ لِلصَّلاَةِ [صحيح البخاري :994]\nAnd he would pray two units [of (sunnah) prayer] before the Fajr prayer, then he would lie on his right side until the muʾad͡hd͡hin would come to him for the (obligatory) prayer”\n\nRarely, the stateful verb has been found to be used to indicate a continuous tense. But in such cases it will likely be in a ḥāl or with an adverb which will help indicate its continuous, rather than habitual, significance. Examples:\n\nأَنَّهُ رَأَى رَجُلاً يَتَّكِئُ عَلَى يَدِهِ الْيُسْرَى [سنن أبي داود :994]\nthat he saw a man reclining on his left hand\nرَأَيْتُ عُمَرَ بْنَ الْخَطَّابِ وَهُوَ يَجْلِسُ وَالنَّاسُ مَعَهُ [tarikh tabari 3/429]\nI saw Ɛumar ibn al-K͡haṭṭāb while he [was] sitting while the people [were] with him\n\n\n\nTransitive verbs of posture\nThe verbs of posture are usually intransitive verbs, as you can see in the examples so far. But a transitive verb of posture can also be used. For example:\n\nسَأَلْتُ ابْنَ عَبَّاسٍ وَهُوَ مُسْنِدٌ ظَهْرَهُ إِلَى الْكَعْبَةِ عَنِ الْبَاذَقِ [سنن النسائي :5687]\nI asked Ibn Ɛabbās, while he was leaning his back against the Kaɛbah, about (a drink called) al-Bād͡haq\nوَقَدْ كُنْتُ مُسْنِدَتَهُ إِلَى صَدْرِي [صحيح البخاري :2741]\n“I had been leaning him against my chest.”\nفَبَيْنَا أَنَا قَاعِدٌ وَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مُتَوَسِّدٌ فَخِذِي [جامع الترمذي :2861]\nSo while I was sitting and the Prophet ﷺ [was] using my thigh as a headrest\n\n\n\nOther verbs that have similar behavior to the verbs of posture\nIn addition to verbs of posture, there are a few other verbs that indicate show the same distiction of the doer participle being used for the continous tense and the stateful verb for the habitual tense. For example: نَامَ to sleep, صَامَ to fast. The reason that these verbs show the same behavior as verbs of posture may be that the doer is not actively doing anything except remaining in a condition. Here are some examples with these verbs:\n\nقُلْنَا لِعَمْرٍو إِنَّ نَاسًا يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَنَامُ عَيْنُهُ وَلاَ يَنَامُ قَلْبُهُ [صحيح البخاري :859]\n“We said to Ɛamr: ‘Indeed some people say that the Prophet ﷺ his eye sleeps but his heart does not sleep.’”\nجَاءَتْ مَلاَئِكَةٌ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهْوَ نَائِمٌ فَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّهُ نَائِمٌ وَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّ الْعَيْنَ نَائِمَةٌ وَالْقَلْبَ يَقْظَانُ [صحيح البخاري :7281]\nSome angels came to the Prophet ﷺ while he was sleeping. Some of them said, “He is sleeping.” Some [others] of them said, “His eye[s] are sleeping but his heart is awake.”\nإِنِّي رَجُلٌ أَصُومُ أَفَأَصُومُ فِي السَّفَرِ [صحيح مسلم :1121d]\n“I am a man who [habitually] fasts, so should I fast in journeying?”\nسِرْنَا مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ صَائِمٌ [صحيح مسلم :1101c]\nWe travelled with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he [was] fasting.\n\n\n\n\n31.3.3 The doer participle for verbs of motion\nThe doer participle is very common with verbs of motion, like: ذَهَبَ to go, مَشَى to walk, رَجَعَ to return, سَارَ to travel, etc. The doer participle for these verbs again indicates the situation of being in a move rather than the actual dynamic movement.1 For example:\n\nوَذَلِكَ الْمَسْجِدُ عَلَى حَافَةِ الطَّرِيقِ الْيُمْنَى، وَأَنْتَ ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى مَكَّةَ [صحيح البخاري :485]\nAnd that mosque is on the right edge of the path as you are going to Makkah\nكَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَأْتِي قُبَاءً رَاكِبًا وَمَاشِيًا [صحيح البخاري :1194]\nThe Prophet ﷺ used to come to Qubāʾ while riding and while walking.\nلَحِقَنِي عَبَايَةُ بْنُ رَافِعٍ وَأَنَا مَاشٍ، إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ [سنن النسائي :3116]\nƐabāyah ibn Rāfiɛ joined me while I was walking to the jumuɛah\nكُنْتُ مُسَافِرًا فَأَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ يَأْكُلُ وَأَنَا صَائِمٌ [سنن النسائي :2281]\n“I was journeying and I came to the Prophet ﷺ while he was eating and I was fasting.”\nبَيْنَا النَّبِيُّ ﷺ سَائِرٌ إِلَى تَبُوكَ نَزَلَ عَنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ [https://hadithunlocked.com/bayhaqi:16844]\n“While the Prophet ﷺ was travelling to Tabūk, he dismounted off his mount”\n\n\n\nثُمَّ أَرْدَفَنِي وَرَاءَهُ عَلَى الْعَضْبَاءِ رَاجِعِينَ إِلَى الْمَدِينَةِ [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:16539]\nThen he seated me behind him on (his camel) al-Ɛaḍbāʾ while we [were] returning to al-Madīnah\nاتَّبَعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ رَاكِبٌ [سنن النسائي :953] [move to verbs of motion]\n“I followed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he was riding”\n\n\nUnlike verbs of posture and temporary state, verbs of motion are frequently used for the continuous tense. Here are some examples:\n\nأَدْرَكَنِي أَبُو عَبْسٍ وَأَنَا أَذْهَبُ إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ [صحيح البخاري :907]\nAbū Ɛabs overtook me while I [was] going to the jumuɛah\nبَيْنَا أَنَا أَسِيرُ مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَيْنَ الْجُحْفَةِ وَالأَبْوَاءِ إِذْ غَشِيَتْنَا رِيحٌ وَظُلْمَةٌ شَدِيدَةٌ [سنن أبي داود :1463] While I was travelling with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ between al-Juḥfah and al-ʾAbwāʾ, suddenly a wind and intense darkness enveloped us",

    "text": "31.4 The doer participle without ٱلْ used to indicate a future event\nIn addition to indicating a static state, another verbal meaning of the doer participle is to indicate the future tense.\nHere too, the doer participle is used instead of the stateful verb. When a stateful verb is used to indicate a future event, then it merely signifies that the speaker thinks that the doer will take an action. For example, the stateful verb أَذْهَبُ (when used to indicate the future tense) merely signifies the speaker’s intention of going some time in the future.\nIn contrast, when the doer participle is used to indicate the future tense, then it signifies that, in the estimation of the speaker, the event will definitely take place. In other words, the doer’s future action is so settled and resolved in the speaker’s mind that doer can already be described by the doer participle. So, for example, if the speaker says أَنَا ذَاهِبٌ and the context tells us he is referring to a future action, then the use of the doer participle ذَاهِب instead of the stateful verb يَذْهَبُ, signifies that the speaker is so sure that he will do this action that he can already be described as a “goer”.\nHere are some examples of the doer participle being used to indicate the future tense:\n\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ\n[سورة الصافات 37:99]\nAnd [then] he said, “Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me.\nفَهُوَ ذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاسِ [صحيح مسلم :2959a]\nFor he is going to go and leave it for the people.\nإِنِّي ذَاكِرٌ لَكَ أَمْرًا [صحيح البخاري :1925]\nI am going to mention to you a matter.\nسَأَلْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنْ يَشْفَعَ لِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقَالَ أَنَا فَاعِلٌ [جامع الترمذي :2433]\nI asked the Propher ﷺ that he intercede for me on the Day of Resurrection. So he said, “I will do [it].”\nوَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّى جَاعِلٌ فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً [سورة البقرة 2:30]\nAnd [mention, O Muḥammad], when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.”\nأَلاَ وَإِنِّي تَارِكٌ فِيكُمْ ثَقَلَيْنِ [صحيح مسلم :2408d]\nUnquestionably, I am leaving amongst you two weighty [things]\n(In English, “I am leaving s.th.” can indicate the future tense.)\nزَعَمَ ابْنُ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ قَاتِلٌ رَجُلاً قَدْ أَجَرْتُهُ [صحيح البخاري :6158]\n“My maternal brother claims that he will kill a man whom I have given protection to.”\nوَإِنِّي مُرْسِلَةٌ إِلَيْهِم بِهَدِيَّةٍ فَنَاظِرَةٌ بِمَ يَرْجِعُ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ [سورة النمل 27:35]\n“But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messengers will return.”\nإِنِّي سَائِلٌ هَذَا عَنْ هَذَا الرَّجُلِ الَّذِي يَزْعُمُ أَنَّهُ نَبِيٌّ [صحيح البخاري :4553]\nI am going to ask this [person] about this man who claims that he is a prophet.\nوَيْحَكَ يَا فُلَانُ تَرَى هَذَا كَائِنًا [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:15841]\nA mercy on you O so-and-so! Do you think this will be?\n\nThe use of the doer participle instead of the stateful verb to indicate a future event can also, depending on context, indicate that the event is imminent, i.e. that it is in the very near future. In such cases it can be translated using “be going to”. For example:\n\nوَقَالَ أَبُو جَهْلٍ فَمَا تُرِيدُ هَذَا سَيّدُ كِنَانَةَ وَهُوَ لَنَا جَارٍ عَلَى مَنْ تَخَلّفَ فَقَالَ عُتْبَةُ لَا شَيْءَ أَنَا خَارِجٌ [مغازي الواقدي 1/38 cited by Marmorstein, M., Tense and text in Classical Arabic 171]\nAbū Jahl said, “So what do you want? This is the chief of Kinānah and he is for us a protector over who remains behind.” So Ɛutbah said, “[I want] nothing. I am going out.”\n\nBy the way, it is not just the doer participle which is used to indicate an imminent future event. The stateful verb can also be used with this meaning. For example,\n\nقَالَتْ أَيْنَ قَالَ أُصَلِّي قَالَتِ اجْلِسْ قَالَ إِنِّي أُصَلِّي [صحيح مسلم :560a]\nShe said, “Where [are you going]?” He said, “I am going to pray.” She said, “Sit!” He said, “Indeed I am going to pray.”\n\nThe doer participle of verbs of posture and verbs of motion don’t have any special behavior when used with a future tense meaning. Examples:\n\nإِنِّي إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَقَائِمٌ الْعَشِيَّةَ فِي النَّاسِ، فَمُحَذِّرُهُمْ هَؤُلاَءِ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَغْصِبُوهُمْ أُمُورَهُمْ [صحيح البخاري :6830]\nI, if Allāh wills, will stand tonight amongst the peope and warn them [about] these [people] who want to forcibly seize their affairs.",

    "text": "31.5 The doer participle without ٱلْ used to indicate a hypothetical event\nThe doer participle, is used very commonly in conditional hypothetical clauses with كَانَ.  Here are some examples:\n\nوَلَوْ كُنْتُ مُتَّخِذًا مِنَ النَّاسِ خَلِيلاً لاَتَّخَذْتُ أَبَا بَكْرٍ خَلِيلاً [صحيح البخاري :467]\nIf I were to take [anyone] from the people as a friend, I would have taken Abū Bakr as a friend.\nلَوْ كُنْتُ مُصَلِّيًا قَبْلَهَا أَوْ بَعْدَهَا لَأَتْمَمْتُهَا [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:5185]\nIf I were to pray before it or after it, I would have completed them.\nوَلَوْ كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَاتِمًا شَيْئًا مِمَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ لَكَتَمَ هَذِهِ الآيَةَ [صحيح مسلم :177b]\nAnd if Muḥammad were to conceal anything from what was revealed to him, he would have concealed this āyah.\nلَوْ كُنْتُ قَاتِلًا رَسُولًا لَضَرَبْتُ أَعْنَاقَكُمَا [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:3708]\nIf I were a killer of a messenger I would have struck your necks.\nلَوْ كُنْتُ آمِرًا أَحَدًا أَنْ يَسْجُدَ لأَحَدٍ لأَمَرْتُ الْمَرْأَةَ أَنْ تَسْجُدَ لِزَوْجِهَا [جامع الترمذي :1159]\nIf I were to order anyone that he prostrate to anyone, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her spouse\nلَوْ كَانَ لَكَ مَا عَلَى الْأَرْضِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ أَكُنْتَ مُفْتَدِيًا بِهِ [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:12289]\nIf you had everything that is on the earth would you ransom yourself with it?\nإِنْ كُنْتَ لاَ بُدَّ فَاعِلاً فَوَاحِدَةً [صحيح مسلم :546]\nIf you must do it then (only) once.\n\nThe stateful verb is also used in such clauses, but it tends to indicate a hypothetical current situation. For example:\n\nلَوْ كُنْتُ أَقْرَبُهَا أَوْ أَدْخُلُ عَلَيْهَا لأَتَيْتُهَا حَتَّى تُشَافِهَنِي بِهِ [صحيح مسلم :746a]\nIf (the current situtation were such that) I were nearing her or entering upon her, I would have come to her so that she would [tell] it to me face-to-face.\nقُل لَّوْ كَانَ فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ مَلَائِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولًا [سورة الإسراء 17:95]\nSay, “If there were upon the earth angels walking securely, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel [as a] messenger.”\nإِنَّ عَبْدَ اللَّهِ رَجُلٌ صَالِحٌ لَوْ كَانَ يُكْثِرُ الصَّلاَةَ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [سنن ابن ماجه :3919]\nIndeed Ɛabd Allāh is a righteous man, if only he would pray much in the night.\n\nThe doer participle can also be used in non-conditional hypothetical sentences (see section (kaana)). For example:\n\nيَا سَلَمَةُ أَتُرَاكَ كُنْتَ فَاعِلاً [صحيح مسلم :1807a]\nO Salamah, do you think you could do [it]?\nأَوَكُنْتَ فَاعِلًا ذَاكَ [مسند أحمد :61]\nWould you have done that?\n\nThe stateful verb is also used in such sentences. For example:\n\nأَنْتَ كُنْتَ تَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ [صحيح مسلم :1788]\nYou would/may have done that",

We would like to state that these are more like trends rather than hard and fast rules. We sometimes find a stateful verb where an doer participle could have worked, and vice versa.\nFor the indication of a static state, consider, for instance, example (18) (وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ لاَبِسٌ مِرْطَ عَائِشَةَ) above and compare it with with example (78) below:\n\nفِإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَلْبَسُ النِّعَالَ الَّتِي لَيْسَ فِيهَا شَعْرٌ [سنن أبي داود :1772]\n“I have seen the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wearing the sandals which don’t have hair on them (i.e. tanned).”\n\nConsider also the following two narrations:\n\n… وَلاَ آخَرُ قَدِ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهُوَ مُنْتَظِرٌ وِلاَدَهَا [صحيح مسلم :1747]\n“… nor another who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is waiting for their giving birth”\n… وَلاَ أَحَدٌ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهْوَ يَنْتَظِرُ وِلاَدَهَا [صحيح البخاري :3124]\n“… nor one who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is waiting for their giving birth”\n\nSimilarly, for the indication of the future tense, contrast example (@ism_fail_going_to_my_lord) with example (81) below:\n\nفَقَالَ يَا أُنَيْسُ أَذَهَبْتَ حَيْثُ أَمَرْتُكَ قَالَ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ أَنَا أَذْهَبُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ [صحيح مسلم :2310a]\nHe said “O Unays, did you go where I commanded you [to go]?” I said, “Yes I am going, O Messenger of Allah”\n\nConsider also the following two narrations:\n\nأَرَأَيْتَكُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلاً تَخْرُجُ بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ أَكُنْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ [صحيح مسلم :208a]\n“Do you think if I were to inform you that there were horsemen emerging out of the foot of this mountain, would you believe me?”\nأَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكُمْ أَنَّ الْعَدُوَّ مُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَوْ مُمَسِّيكُمْ، أَكُنْتُمْ تُصَدِّقُونِي [صحيح البخاري :4972]\n“Do you think if I told you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, will you believe me?”",

But, the doer participle without ٱلْ can also carry the significance of the perfect verb. Such that it can indicate that the doer has completed the action of the verb. As when the doer participle was used in an imperfect sense, here too it can indicate being in a static state. Examples: \n\nلَا آتِيكَ مُجْرِمًا [Fischer 112]\nI shall not come to you as one who has committed a crime.\n(مُجْرِمًا is here in place of the perfect verb وَقَدْ أَجْرَمْتُ.)\nجِيءَ بِالنُّعَيْمَانِ أَوِ ابْنِ النُّعَيْمَانِ شَارِبًا [صحيح البخاري :2316]\nal-Nuɛaymān or al-Nuɛaymān’s son was brought (in a state of) of having drunk (wine).\nقَالَ جَابِرٌ فَبَيْنَا أَنَا نَازِلٌ تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ إِذَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم [موطأ مالك :48]\n“While I was (resting) dismounted under a tree, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ [came].”\nلَوْ كُنْتُ مُتَوَضِّئًا أَكَلْتُهُ [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:15147, graded weak by al-ʾArnaʾūṭ]\nIf I were in a state of having done wuḍūʾ, I would have eaten it.\n\nWhen used with a perfect significance, then, according to most authorities, the doer participle cannot usually have a direct doee.

    "text": "31.8 The doer participle prefixed with ٱل\nConsider the sentence:\n\nرَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ\nI saw the man.\n\nThe definite article ٱل indicates that the listener would know identity of the person who was seen because of his being referred to as a definite entity: الرَّجُلَ the man.\nConsider now the sentence:\n\nرَأَيْتُ الضَّارِبَ\nI saw the beaterm.\n\nNow the person who was seen is identified, not by his virtue of being an entity, but because of his being the doer of the verb ضَرَبَ يَضْرِبُ. In this sense, the noun الضَّارِب is similar in meaning to الَّذِي ضَرَبَ/يَضْرِبُ the one who beat/beats.\nSimilarly, if we say:\n\nجَاءَتِ الضَّارِبَةُ\nThe beaterf came.\n\nthen this is similar to saying جَاءَتِ الَّتِي ضَرَبَتْ/تَضْرِبُ The onef who beat/beats came.\nBecause of the equivalence of this ٱل to the connected nouns (ٱلَّذِي, ٱلَّتِي, etc.), this ٱل, that is prefixed to doer participles (and to deverbal nouns in general) is called the connected noun ٱل. We will learn more about the connected noun ٱل in section (ref).\nFor now, we note that when the connected noun ٱل, is prefixed to a deverbal noun then the deverbal noun retains its capability to govern a doer and a a-state governee.\nSo in example (@) جَاءَتِ الضَّارِبَةُ, the doer participle الضَّارِبَة is governing a latent doer pronoun [هِيَ]. And in the following example, the doer participle is also governing a direct doee:\n\n\nفَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَنِ الْقَائِلُ كَلِمَةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [صحيح مسلم :601]\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Who is the one who said such and such speech?”\nعَاتَبْتُ الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدَ\nI reproved the promise-breaker.\n\nThe construction الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدَ  can also be converted to a superficial annexation, thus:\n\n\nعَاتَبْتُ الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدِ\nI reproved the promise-breaker.\n\nWhen the connected noun ٱل is used with an doer participle, then the doer participle includes the meaning of the verb. So much so, that an actual verb may be conjuncted to the meaning of the verb that is included in the doer participle.2 For example:\n\nإِنَّ ٱلْمُصَّدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُصَّدِّقَاتِ وَأَقْرَضُوا ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمْ وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ [سورة الحديد 57:18]\n“Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allāh a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward.”",

    "section": "31.9 The doer participle that crosses over to the entity noun",
    "text": "31.9 The doer participle that crosses over to the entity noun\nSometimes, the doer participle is re-used as a entity noun. When this happens, it loses its purely verbal meaning of the doer of a verb, and signifies only an entity, just like a entity noun. There are two categories of doer participle-crossover entity nouns:\n\n\nThe lexical doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun\nThe ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun\n\nIn reality, these are not completely distinct categories. They more represent a spectrum of meanings. And it can be a judgement call as to which category a particluar noun may belong. We will discuss each of these categories in the following sub-sections:\n\n31.9.1 The lexical doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun\nThe doer participle is from the class of adjectival nouns, not entity nouns. And in terms of its meaning, it has a relatively temporary and incidental meaning when compared to a entity noun. For example the the doer participle ضَارِب beater would only be applicable to someone when he is associated with the act of beating. Otherwise he would not be referred to as a ضَارِب. On the other hand, a entity noun like رَجُل man has a more permanent meaning, that is not associated with any action from him.\nSome doer participle’s can take on this more permanent meaning of a entity noun. Usually, their meaning will be somewhat distinct from the original doer participle or the verb from which it is derived. Such a doer participle is termed a lexical doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun because its new meaning often deserves a new lexical definition in the dictionary.\nFor example, the doer participle صَاحِب (from the verb صَحِبَ يَصْحَبُ to accompany) is predominantly used as a entity noun to mean companion. With this meaning, it can no longer act as a verb-like governor. So it will not have a latent doer pronoun, and it will not govern a direct doee. So we cannot say:\n\n✗ حَسَّامٌ صَاحِبٌ يَاسِرًا [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 487 citing العدناني]\nḤassām is a companion of Yāsir.\n\nAdditionally any ٱل that is prefixed to a doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun cannot be the connected noun ٱل. It will be the regular ٱل that is prefixed to entity nouns.3 So when it is the annexe noun in an annexation then it must be a real annexation, and the ٱل is dropped.\nSo we will say:\n\nصَحِبَ حَسَّامٌ يَاسِرًا فَهُوَ صَاحِبُهُ [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 487 citing العدناني]\nḤassām accompanied Yāsir so he is his companion.\n\nWith regard to their plurals, the default behavior for the doer participle, especially when used with a verbal meaning, is to have a sound plural. But when the doer participle crosses-over to a entity noun then it is more likely to have a broken plural.4\nHere are some examples of entity nouns from cross-over doer participles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nentity noun\nmeaning\nplural\nverb\n\n\n\n\nصَاحِب\na companion\nأَصْحَاب\nصَحِبَ يَصْحَبُ to accompany\n\n\nسَائِل\na beggar\nسَأَلَة, سُؤَّال\nسَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ to ask\n\n\nعَالِم\na scholar\nعُلَمَاء\nعَلِمَ يَعْلَمُ to know\n\n\nقَاضٍ\na judge\nقُضَاة\nقَضَى يَقْضِي to decree\n\n\nكَاتِب\na scribe\nكَتَبَة\nكَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ to write\n\n\nشَاعِر\na poet\nشُعَرَاء\nشَعَرَ يَشْعُرُ to be aware\n\n\nبَالِغ\na legally mature person\nبَالِغُونَ\nبَلَغَ يَبْلُغُ to reach\n\n\nمُصِيبَة\na calamity\nمَصَائِب\nأَصَابَ يُصِيبُ to strike\n\n\nجَارِيَة\na girl\nجَوَارٍ\nجَرَى يَجْرِي to run\n\n\nطَالِب\na student\nطَلَبَة, طُلَّاب\nطَلَبَ يَطْلُبُ to seek\n\n\nشَارِب\na moustache\nشَوَارِب\nشَرِبَ يَشْرَبُ to drink\n\n\nسَاحِل\na shore\nسَوَاحِل\nسَحَلَ يَسْحَلُ to abrade\n\n\nجَامِع\na large mosque\nجَوَامِع\nجَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ to gather\n\n\nجَامِعَة\na university\nجَامِعَات\nجَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ to gather\n\n\nقَائِمَة\na leg (of a beast, furniture)\nقَوَائِم\nقَامَ يَقُومُ to stand\n\n\nوَارِث\nan heir\nوَرَثَة, وُرَّاث\nوَرَثَ يَرِثُ to inherit\n\n\nوَالِدٌ\na parent\nوَالِدُونَ\nوَلَدَ يَلِدُ to beget (offspring)\n\n\nحَامِل\na carrier\nحَمَلَة\nحَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ to carry\n\n\nقَارِئ\na reciter\nقُرَّاء\nقَرَأَ يَقٌرَأُ to read, recite\n\n\nمُعَلِّم\na teacher\nمُعَلِّمُونَ\nعَلَّمَ يُعَلِّمُ to teach\n\n\n\nWhen the doer participle that has crossed over to a entity noun refers to human beings, then often, but not always, a feminine version of the crossed over entity noun will also exist, with a ة. So صَاحِبَة is a female companion, وَالِدَة is a female parent, etc. Sometimes, however, the entity noun exists for only one gender and not for the other, e.g. جَارِيَة a girl. Also sometimes, the same entity noun is used for both genders, e.g. بَالِغ a legally mature person. So we will say:\n\nرجل بالغٌ، وامرأة بالغ [المذكر والمؤنث لابن الأنباري 1/136]\nA legally mature man and a legally mature woman\n\nThere is often some flexibility in these cases, so بَالِغَة can also be used for a female legally mature person. The dictionary is the best guide in these matters.\nRecall from section (ref) that the ة that exists in a feminine doer participle is because of its latent doer pronoun. So when we say هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ Hind is standing then the ة in قَائِمَةٌ is to match its latent doer pronoun [هِيَ] that refers to هِنْدٌ. But the ة that exists in a doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun is no longer because of a latent doer pronoun. This is because, as mentioned previously, the doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun is not a verb-like governor, so it will not govern a latent doer pronoun. So the ة in the doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns صَاحِبَة female companion and وَالِدَة female parent is a fixed feminine marker, just like the ة in any other feminine entity noun, e.g. شَجَرَة tree, امْرَأَة woman, etc.\nAdditionally, once a doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun, then like all entity nouns, it loses its genderizability. So we cannot add or remove a feminine marker (like ة) at will. For example, if we wish to say The building is a university, then we will say\n\nالْبِنَاءُ جَامِعَةٌ\nThe building is a university.\n\nWe cannot remove ة from جَامِعَةٌ in order to match the gender of الْبِنَاءُ. If we do so then the meaning will be:\n\nالْبِنَاءُ جَامِعٌ\nThe building is a large mosque.\n\nIn this case, جَامِع happens to exist as another doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun. So example () is a valid sentence, but with a different meaning than intended.\nSometimes it can be difficult to tell whether a noun from this category is an doer participle with its original meaning, or one that has crossed over to a entity noun. If you find that it is used independently (in meaning) without referring to an (implicit or explicit) referent, then it is likely that it is a doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun. Another clue is that it is used with a broken plural.5 But broken plurals may be used for governing doer participles as well (as we saw in section (ref)) so this isn’t a definitive indicator. A more reliable indicator is whether it is made definite by being annexed to a definite base noun in a real annexation. Here are some examples:\n\nهؤلاء حملة الأقلام [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 503]\nThese are the carriers of the pens.\nوَمَنْ تَرَكَ مَالاً فَلِوَرَثَتِهِ وَأَنَا وَارِثُ مَنْ لاَ وَارِثَ لَهُ أَعْقِلُ لَهُ وَأَرِثُهُ وَالْخَالُ وَارِثُ مَنْ لاَ وَارِثَ لَهُ يَعْقِلُ عَنْهُ وَيَرِثُهُ [سنن أبي داود :2899]\nWhoever leaves wealth then [it is] for his heirs. And I am the heir of he who has no heir, paying blood-wit for him and inheriting from him. And the maternal uncle is the heir of he who has no heir, paying blood-wit for him and inheriting from him.\n\nAnother possible indicator is whether the doer participle as an info mismatches in gender with the subject. For example:\n\nالْعُودُ قَائِمَةٌ\nThe stick is a leg (of some furniture or other structure).\n(If the doer participle was intended, then we would say الْعُودُ قَائِمٌ The stick is standing.)\n\nBut this isn’t always reliable because the subject may match in gender with the doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun anyway. For example:\n\nالْعَصَا قَائِمَةٌ\nThe stick is a leg.\nor The stick is standing.\n(عَصًا is a feminine noun.)\n\nAnother indicator also whether the singular feminine of the doer participle is used as a info or attribute for non-intelligent beings. For example:\n\nالْأَعْوَادُ قَائِمَةٌ\nThe sticks are standing.\n\nIn the above example قَائِمَةٌ is likely to be an doer participle. (By the way, a entity noun reading is also possible: the sticks (collectively) are a leg.) But if we say:\n\nالْأَعْوَادُ قَوَائِمُ\nThe sticks are legs.\n\nthen قَوَائِمُ is more likely to be a entity noun. Context is a useful guide here.\n\n\n\n31.9.2 The ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun\nThis second category consists of doer participles that are made entity nouns on an ad hoc basis. That is, the dictionary will typically not list the doer participle (for this category of meaning) separately for any distinct meaning.\nTh ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun is routinely formed for doer participles that signify the action of a perfect verb. This is especially done when the doer participle of the perfect action is to be the annexe noun in a (now real) annexation.\nSo for example, if someone has done the action of beating, then he can be described as a ضَارِب. Now, if we wish to refer to this specific person, we have a choice: Either we can use the connected noun ٱل or we can use the regular ٱل. Either way, the word will look the same: الضَّارِب. But its meaning will be slightly different.\nIn the case of the connected noun ٱل, we are defining the person based on an action of beating that he did. الضَّارِب, in this case, remains a doer participle.\nAnd in the case of the regular ٱل, we are defining him by virtue of his entity. Just like we would say الرَّجُل the man, الْمَرْأَة the woman, etc. الضَّارِب, in this case, becomes a entity noun.\nEither of these can generally be used when describing the definite doer of a perfect verb. When the semantic direct doee of the verb is mentioned, then the doer participle الضَّارِب retains its ٱل and governs the semantic direct doee in the a-state. For example:\n\nهَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا أَمْسِ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/100; الأصول في النحو لابن السراج 2/265]\nThis [person] [was] the one who beat Zayd yesterday\n(الضَّارِب is a doer participle governing a latent doer pronoun and a direct doee.)\n\nBut the entity noun الضَّارِب cannot govern a direct doee and so it has to be annexed to the semantic direct doee in a real annexation So we will say:\n\nهَذَا ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ أَمْسِ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/32; معاني النحو 3/171 citing الزجاجي]\nThis [person] [was] the beater of Zayd yesterday\n(ضَارِب is a entity noun in a real annexation.)\n\nIn theory, if the speaker intends to define the person by his being the doer of the verb ضَرَبَ, then he would use example (106). 6 And if the speaker intends to define the person by virtue of his entity then he would use example (107).\nBut in practice, they are often (but not always) close enough in meaning that they can be used interchangeably. Here is another example:\n\nفَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ مَنْ قَائِلُهَا [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:7060]\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Who is the sayer of it?”\nCompare with example (91) مَنِ الْقَائِلُ كَلِمَةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا above.\n\n\n\n31.9.3 The doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun as a attribute\nOnce an doer participle has crossed over to a entity noun, it can still be used as a attribute. This is because the the doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun still signifies its verbal meaning to some degree. So, for example, ضَارِب, even once it has crossed over to a entity noun still signifies its verbal meaning of being a one who beats. But because it is now a entity noun, it will lose its ال when is a annexe noun. Consider the following example:\n\nمررت بزيد ضارب عمر [المقتضب للمبرد 4/149]\nI passed by the beater-of-Ɛamr Zayd\n\nSee also the tafsīrs of:\n\nمَـٰلِكِ یَوۡمِ ٱلدِّینِ [سورة الفاتحة 1:4]\nSovereign of the Day of Recompense.\nٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَ ٰ⁠تِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ جَاعِلِ ٱلۡمَلَـٰۤىِٕكَةِ رُسُلًا أُو۟لِیۤ أَجۡنِحَةࣲ مَّثۡنَىٰ وَثُلَـٰثَ وَرُبَـٰعَۚ [سورة فاطر 35:1]\n[All] praise is [due] to Allāh, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four.\n\n\n\n31.9.4 The doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun of doubly transitive verb\nAs we have mentioned, when an doer participle crosses over to a entity noun, then it cannot govern a doer or an a-state governee like a direct doee. But an exception is made for the doer participle of transitive verb that has two direct doees. When an doer participle of such a verb is used with a perfect meaning (as a entity noun) in a real annexation, then it’s first semantic direct doee is made into the base noun but it’s second direct doee remains in the a-state. We mentioned this already in section (ref) and gave the following example:\n\nهذا معطي زيد أمس درهما [شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/78]\nThis [person] was the giver of Zayd, yesterday, a dirham.\n\n\n\n\n31.9.5 An doer participle can co-exist with its doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns\nWhen a cross-over entity noun exists, it does not mean that the original doer participle meaning has ceased to exist. Both can continue to exist and context will clue us in as to which meaning is intended. For example, بَالِغ is used as an doer participle here:\n\nهَدۡیَۢا بَـٰلِغَ ٱلۡكَعۡبَةِ [سورة المائدة 5:95]\nas an offering [to Allāh] delivered to the Kaʿbah\n\nFor some cross-over entity nouns, however, the entity noun usage is predominant and the original doer participle meaning is virtually non-existent. Such is the case for صَاحِب a companion and وَالِد a parent.7",

    "text": "31.10 Eligibility to be described with the doer participle\nTheoretically, anyone who is the doer of a verb can be described with its doer participle. So, for example, any person who is the doer of the verb قَرَأَ, even once, can be called a قَارِئ. And from context it will be understood that the person is being called a قَارِئ within the situation of a certain reading or recitation. Here are some examples:\n\nأَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم صَلَّى الظُّهْرَ فَجَعَلَ رَجُلٌ يَقْرَأُ خَلْفَهُ بِسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الأَعْلَى فَلَمَّا انْصَرَفَ قَالَ أَيُّكُمْ قَرَأَ أَوْ أَيُّكُمُ الْقَارِئُ [صحيح مسلم :398b]\nthat the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prayed the ḍ͡huhr prayer, and a man began to recite behind him [sūrat al-Aɛlā]. When [the Prophet ﷺ concluded the prayer and] turned around, he said: “Which of you recited?” or “Which of you [was] the reciter?”\nسَمِعَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَارِئًا يَقْرَأُ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ [صحيح البخاري :5042]\nThe Prophet ﷺ heard a reciter reciting the Qurʾān in the mosque at night.\n\nHaving said that, the doer participle is a noun. And a noun, by its very nature, signifies a more permanence and constancy in its meaning than a verb. So there can be scenarios where being described by an doer participle can have a higher bar of eligibility than simply being the doer of a verb. Consider for example سورة الكافرون:\n\nقُلۡ یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلۡكَـٰفِرُونَ۝ لَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ مَا تَعۡبُدُونَ۝ وَلَاۤ أَنتُمۡ عَـٰبِدُونَ مَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ۝ وَلَاۤ أَنَا۠ عَابِدࣱ مَّا عَبَدتُّمۡ۝ وَلَاۤ أَنتُمۡ عَـٰبِدُونَ مَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ۝ لَكُمۡ دِینُكُمۡ وَلِیَ دِینِ۝\n\n[سورة الكافرون]\nSay, “O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.”\nIbn al-Qayyim says, in the tafsīr of this sūrah:\n\nNegation isn’t employed for [the disbelievers] except by the doer participle. And for [the Prophet ﷺ], [negation] is employed once using the verb, and once using the doer participle.\nAnd this is – and Allāh knows best – due to a marvelous wisdom, which is that the greater objective is [the Prophet’s ﷺ] disassociation from their gods from every perspective and in every [instance of] time. So [the Prophet ﷺ, in speaking to the disbelievers with the words of the revealed sūrah], used first the verb [أَعْبُدُ], which signifies dynamic occurrence, and then used for this same negation the doer participle [عَابِد] in the second instance, i.e. “This [worshipping of what you worship] is not my description nor my state of affairs.” [This is] as if he had said: “Worshipping other than Allāh will not be an verbal action of mine, nor a descrption of mine.” Thus he used two negations for two negated items [a verbal action, and a description], that are intended by the negation.\nAs for [the negation used for the disbelievers], he used only the doer participle [عَابِدُونَ], which signifies the description [of its referent by the doer participle] and the stability [of this description], i.e. “The stable, requisite, description [of being a worshipper] of Allah is negated from you. For this description cannot be established for you. It is only established for the one who singles out Allāh exclusively for worship, and then does not associate anyone with Him. But you, because you have worshipped other than Him, are not from His worshippers.” Even if they may have worshipped Allāh some of the time. For the polytheist worships Allāh and worships, with Him, others besides Him. Just like the People of the Cave said: And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than Allāh [سورة الكهف 18:16] i.e., “you have withdrawn from their gods excluding Allāh, for you have not withdrawn from Him.” And similarly did the polytheists say regarding their gods: “We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allāh in position.” [سورة الزمر 39:3]. Thus they used to worship, with Him, others besides Him. So the verb [عَبَدَ يَعْبُدُ] is not negated from them because of its occurrence from them. But the description [عَابِد] is negated because whoever worshipped other than Allāh is not established on the worship of Allāh, and is not described by [being a worshipper of Allāh].8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.10.1 The doer participle indicating a habitual doer\nIn addition to the default incidental meaning, the meaning of the doer that is indicated by the doer participle can be a habitual meaning. For example:\n\n\nزَيْدٌ مُكْرِمٌ ضِيفَانِهِ [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 482]\nZayd is an honorer to his guests",

    "section": "31.11 Verbs for which the doer participle is rarely used",
    "text": "31.11 Verbs for which the doer participle is rarely used\n\n31.11.1 The doer participle for stative verbs\nTechnically, an doer participle can be formed from any verb.9 For form 1 verbs, it will always be on the pattern فَاعِل. However, there are some verbs for which their doer participles are rarely used.\nThese are verbs which indicate only being in a static state, with virtually no dynamic action. The meaning signified is usually (but not exclusively) an innate permanent quality. For such verb, the their participle-like adjectives (see chapter (ref)) are generally used instead of their doer participles. The following table lists some such verbs, along with their rarely used doer participles, and their commonly used participle-like adjectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle\nparticiple-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nكَرُمَ\nto be noble, generous\nكَارِم\nكَرِيم noble, generous\n\n\nبَخِلَ\nto be stingy\nبَاخِل\nبَخِيل stingy\n\n\nفَرِحَ\nto by joyous\nفَارِح\nفَرِح joyous\n\n\nضَاقَ\nto be narrow\nضَائِق\nضَيِّق narrow\n\n\nحَسُنَ\nto be handsome\nحَاسِن\nحَسَن handsome\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the doer participles for such verbs can be used, on occasion, to indicate a incidental state that has only temporary occurred. As opposed to the more permanent state that the participle-like adjective would signify.10 For example:\n\nفَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكُۢ بَعۡضَ مَا یُوحَىٰۤ إِلَیۡكَ وَضَاۤىِٕقُۢ بِهِۦ صَدۡرُكَ أَن یَقُولُوا۟ لَوۡلَاۤ أُنزِلَ عَلَیۡهِ كَنزٌ أَوۡ جَاۤءَ مَعَهُۥ مَلَكٌۚ [سورة هود 11:12 cited by النحو الوافي 3/240 footnote 3]\nThen would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you, or is your breast constrained by it because they say, “Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?”\n\nAccording to the commentary on this āyah, ضَائِق is used in place of he more commonly used ضَيِّق to indicate a temporary constrictness.11\n\n\n\n31.11.2 The doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\nSometimes, for stative verbs like the above what would appear to be an doer participle is very commonly used. But actually, these usages are from the class of doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjectives. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nعَدَلَ\nto be just\nعَادِل just\n\n\nبَسُلَ\nto be courageous\nبَاسِل courageous\n\n\nصَلُحَ\nto be righteous\nصَالِح righteous\n\n\nرَبِحَ\nto be profitable\nرَابِح profitable\n\n\nنَعُمَ\nto be soft\nنَاعِم soft\n\n\n\nWe will study this category in more detail in section (ref), if Allāh wills.\n\n\n31.11.3 Verbs for which the doer participle is rarely used in place of the stateful verb\nThe doer participle is also not found used in place of a stateful verb for various other classes of verbs, including verbs that indicate mental states, perception, or action.12 Such verbs include رَأَى to see, رَجَا to hope, أَرَادَ to want, and others. For such verbs, only the verb is typically used when the meaning of the verb is needed. Nevertheless, the doer participle for such verbs has been found to be used on occasion. Examples:\n\nأَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ص لَمَّا انْصَرَفَ مِنَ الطَّائِفِ مُرِيدًا مَكَّةَ مَرَّ بِهِ بَعْضُ أَهْلِ مَكَّةَ [تاريخ الطبري 2/347 cited by Waltisberg, M., Satzkomplex und funktion 293]\nthat the Messenger of Allah, when he departed from al-Ṭāʾif intending (as his destination) Makkah, one of the people of Makkah passed by him.\nأُرَانِي اللَّيْلَةَ عِنْدَ الْكَعْبَةِ فَرَأَيْتُ رَجُلاً آدَمَ كَأَحْسَنِ مَا أَنْتَ رَاءٍ مِنْ أُدْمِ الرِّجَالِ [صحيح البخاري :6999]\nI saw myself (in a dream) near the Kaɛbah last night, and I saw a man with whitish red complexion, the best you may see amongst men of that complexion.\n\nThe doer participle of such verbs may also freely be used when its essential “doer” meaning is intended. For example:\n\nوَكَمْ مِنْ مُرِيدٍ لِلْخَيْرِ لَنْ يُصِيبَهُ [https://hadithunlocked.com/darimi:210]\nHow many of an intender of goodness shall not achieve it.",

The doer participle is the closest of the deverbal nouns to the verb. We saw in chapter (ref) that it can govern in a verb-like manner and even be used in place of a verb.\nThe participle-like adjective, although not as close to the verb as the doer participle, can also govern in a manner which is similar (but not quite exactly the same) as the governing of the doer participle.

    "section": "32.5 The participle-like adjective in a superficial annexation",
    "text": "32.5 The participle-like adjective in a superficial annexation\nLike the doer participle, the participle-like adjective forms a superficial annexation with its governee. In section (ref), we learned that the doer participle forms a superficial annexation between the doer participle and its semantic direct doee. The participle-like adjective is typically from an intransitive verb. so it will not have a direct doee. Instead, it forms a superficial annexation in two ways:\n\nA superficial annexation between the participle-like adjective and its semantic doer.\nA superficial annexation between the participle-like adjective and its tamyīz.\n\n\n32.5.1 Superficial annexation between the participle-like adjective and its semantic doer\nThe participle-like adjective can form a superficial annexation between the participle-like adjective and its semantic doer. It does this by first transforming its doer into a direct doee-like governee. Wil will explaing this process below:\nConsider the sentence:\n\nمررت برجل حسنٍ وجهُه [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 1077]\n\nIn this sentence, the participle-like adjective has a definite sababi doer وجهه. This sentence is transformed in the following manner4:\n\nFirst step of the transformation\nFirstly, the base noun pronoun ه in وجهه is transferred to being a latent doer pronoun of the participle-like adjective حسن.\n\n\nSecond step of the transformation\nSecondly, وجه, with its base noun pronoun ه eliminated, is made into الوجه to keep it definite (to match وجهه which was also definite).\nNow that the participle-like adjective حسن already has a doer (its latent doer pronoun هو), the noun الوجه cannot be its doer. So it is made into what we will call a direct doee-like governee. So it is put into the a-state thus: الْوَجْهَ.\nWe call الْوَجْهَ a direct doee-like governee, and not a true direct doee because, in meaning, it is still the doer of the participle-like adjective حسن. The participle-like adjective حسن is derived from an intransitive verb حَسُنَ which does not take a direct doee.\nWith this transformation, the sentence becomes:\n\nمررت برجل حسنٍ الوجهَ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 1080]\n\nIt is important to note that this transformation affects only the syntax of the sentence, but not its meaning. The participle-like adjective حسن is still describing a quality of الوجه, not رجل.\nBut now that الوجه is not syntactically the doer of the participle-like adjective, the participle-like adjective match its syntactic referent رجل in gender and number, not its semantic doer الوجه. So we will say:\n\nمررت برجلين حسنين الوجهين\nمررت برجالٍ حسانٍ الوجوهَ\nمررت بمرأة حسنة الوجهَ\nمررت بمرأتين حسنتين الوجهين\n\nRemember, that it الوجه were syntactically the doer, then we would have said instead:\n\nمررت برجلين حسنين وجهاهما\nمررت بمرأة حَسَنٍ وجهُهَا\n\netc.\nThe transformation that we have described above works exactly the same for definite participle-like adjectives. So we will say:\n\nمررت بالرجل الحسن الوجهَ\nجاءت المرأتان الحسنتان الوجهين\n\netc.\n\n\nFinal step of the transformation\nA sentence with a direct doee-like governee, like in example () مررت برجل حسنٍ الوجهَ above, while grammatically correct, is rarely used in practice.5 The main purpose of the direct doee-like governee is that it is used as a intermediate step for the final step of the transformation: and that is into a superficial annexation6 This is done by converting the direct doee-like governee into a syntactic base noun.\n\n\nLets start with participle-like adjectives with their direct doee-like governees:\n\nIndefinite participle-like adjective: حَسَنٌ الْوَجْهَ\nDefinite participle-like adjective: الْحَسَنُ الْوَجْهَ\n\nThe a-state direct doee-like governees are converted into base nouns in the i-state:\n\nIndefinite participle-like adjective: حَسَنُ الْوَجْهِ\nDefinite participle-like adjective: الْحَسَنُ الْوَجْهِ\n\nHere are some examples using this superficial annexation:\n\nمررت برجل حسنِ الوجهِ [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 1078, 1081]\nجاء الرجل الحسنُ الوجهِ\n\nNote that, because الوجه is a a-state governee, and not the doer, of the participle-like adjective, therefore, the participle-like adjective is feminized, dualized, or pluralized to match its referent, not الوجه. Examples:\n\nهند حسنة الوجه [شرح الرضي على الكافية 3/439]\nالزيدان حسنا الوجهين [شرح الرضي على الكافية 3/439]\nالزيدون حسنو الوجوه [شرح الرضي على الكافية 3/439]",

    "text": "32.6 The participle-like adjective with a tamyīz\nRemember from section (ref), that the tamyīz is a a-state governee that specifies the scope of its governor. As a verb-like noun, the participle-like adjective can govern a tamyīz. So we can say, for example:\n\nمررت برجل حسن وجهًا [البسيط لابن أبي الربيع 1080]\nجاءت المرأة الحسنة وجهًا\nالزيدون حسنون وجوها [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 9/241]\n\n\n32.6.1 Superficial annexation of the participle-like adjective with a tamyīz\nAs with the participle-like adjective that has a direct doee-like governee, the participle-like adjective with a tamyīz also can also form a superficial annexation.\nSo حَسَنٌ وَجْهًا will become:\n\nحسنُ وجهٍ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 171]\n\nAgain, the participle-like adjective will match its referent in gender and number. So, for example, we will say:\n\nهم حسنو وجوه [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 9/227]\n\nUnlike, the participle-like adjective with a direct doee-like governee, a participle-like adjective prefixed by ال with a tamyīz does not form a superficial annexation This is because a definite annexe noun with an indefinite base noun is fundamentally inconsistent with an annexation construction.7{.citex} So الْحَسَنُ وَجْهًا, however, does not form a superficial annexation to become:\n\n✗ الحسنُ وجهٍ [الضمير المستتر لسعود بن عبيد الله الصاعدي 169]\n\nFinally, whereas the participle-like adjective with its direct doee-like governee (e.g. حَسَنُ الْوَجْهَ) is pretty much only used as an intermediate step to form a superficial annexation, such is not the case for the participle-like adjective with a tamyīz. The participle-like adjective with a tamyīz can be used, as is, without converting it into a superficial annexation.8",

    "text": "32.10 Significance of the participle-like adjective\nThe participle-like adjective is typically derived from a stative verb. A stative verb is one which, rather than describing any process or action, signifies that its doer is in a particular state. Futhermore, its doer does not do any actual work or action that causes him to be in the state described by the participle-like adjective.\n\n32.10.1 Permanence of the meaning of the participle-like adjective\nSome participle-like adjectives have a very permanent meaning. For example:\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nأَخْضَر\ngreen\n\n\nأَعْرَج\nlame\n\n\nشَرِيف\nnoble, highborn\n\n\nزَنِيم\nignoble, baseborn\n\n\n\nOthers are fairly permanent but can change gradually. For example:\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nجَمِيل\nbeautiful\n\n\nقَبِيح\nugly\n\n\n\nOthers can change fairly quickly.

Rarely, we find a participle-like adjective which is derived from a transitive verb. For example:\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nثَكْلَان\n[bereft (of child)\n\n\n\n\n\n32.10.3 Participle-like adjectives whose meaning aligns with the doee\nMost of the time, the participle-like adjective aligns in meaning with the doer of the verb from which it is derived. For example, حَسَن handsome aligns in meaning with the doer of the verb حَسُنَ to be handsome. Occasionally, however, the participle-like adjective aligns in meaning with the doee of its verb. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective\nmeaning\nverb\n\n\n\n\nحَمِيد\npraiseworthy\nحَمِدَ to praise (s.o.)\n\n\nذَمِيم\nblameworthy\nذَمَّ to blame (s.o.)\n\n\nمَنِيع\ninaccessible, impregnable\nمَنَعَ to prevent (s.o., s.th.)",

    "text": "32.11 The doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\nWhereas participle-like adjective are typically derived from stative verbs, doer participles are derived from both intransitive verbs (like قَائِم from قَامَ to stand), and transitive verbs (like ضَارِب from ضَرَبَ to beat). Furthermore, when a verb has a stative meaning, then, as we learned in section (ref) its doer participle is often not in common usage. Instead, a participle-like adjective will often exist for the stative verb and the participle-like adjective will be generally used instead. For example, the doer participle كَارِم of the stative verb كَرُمَ to be noble, generous is rarely used. Instead, the participle-like adjective كَرِيم noble, generous will generally be used instead. But, as we also learned, كَارِم could be used when temporary meaning is intended.\nThe above is the general rule for doer participles of stative verbs. However, there are some stative verbs, for which the doer participle is commonly used, but only after it crosses over to become a participle-like adjective. As with the doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun there are two categories of doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjectives:\n\nThe lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\nThe ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n32.11.1 The lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\nThe lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective is one which is commonly used with its participle-like adjective meaning. It will typically have its own entry in a dictionary. Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nطَهُرَ\nto be clean\nطَاهِر clean\n\n\nضَمَرَ\nto be lean\nضَامِر lean\n\n\nصَلُحَ\nto be righteous\nصَالِح righteous\n\n\nنَعُمَ\nto be soft\nنَاعِم soft\n\n\nبَسُلَ\nto be courageous\nبَاسِل courageous\n\n\n\nSometimes, a true participle-like adjective with a similar meaning, can co-exist with the lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective, For example طَهِير clean.\nSometimes, lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective occurs for verbs which are not purely stative. In fact, it can even occur for transitive verbs. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nعَدَلَ\nto act justly\nعَادِل just\n\n\nرَبِحَ\nto gain a profit\nرَابِح profitable\n\n\nظَلَمَ\nto wrong (s.o.)\nظَالِم unjust, tyrannical\n\n\nرَحِمَ\nto have mercy (on s.o.)\nرَاحِم merciful\n\n\nقَطَعَ\nto cut (s.th.)\nقَاطِع sharp, incisive\n\n\n\nOccasionally, the meaning of the doer participle can change considerably when it crosses over to a participle-like adjective. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nكَتَمَ\nto conceal (s.th)\nكَاتِم concealed\n\n\nدَفَقَ\nto pour (s.th.)\nدَافِق poured forth\n\n\n\nIn the above examples, we can see that the lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjectives actually have the meaning of the doee participles. So سِرٌّ كَاتِمٌ [Lane’s Lexicon »دفق«] is a concealed secret, and مَاءٌ دَافِقٌ [Lane’s Lexicon »دفق«] is water that is poured forth.12 But the doer participle can still be used with its original meaning. For example:\n\nوَلَوْ كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَاتِمًا شَيْئًا مِمَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ لَكَتَمَ هَذِهِ الآيَةَ [صحيح مسلم :177b]\nAnd if Muḥammad were to conceal anything from what was revealed to him, he would have concealed this āyah.\n\nWhen an doer participle crosses over to a participle-like adjective, then it will govern in the manner of a participle-like adjective. So, it can govern a doer, and the doer is transformed into a direct doee-like governee, which is then used in a superficial annexation. For example:\n\nطَاهِرُ الْقَلْبِ [شرح التصريح على التوضيح 2/41]\nclean of heart\n(The transformation is طَاهِرٌ قَلْبُهُ → طَاهِرٌ الْقَلْبَ → طَاهِرُ الْقَلْبِ.)\nضَامِرُ الْكَشْحِ [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 10/298]\nlean of flank\n(The transformation is ضَامِرٌ كَشْحُهُ → ضَامِرٌ الْكَشْحَ → ضَامِرُ الْكَشْحِ.)\n\nThe process above is normal and straightforward when it comes to doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjectives that are derived from intransitive verbs. But if a doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective is derived from a transitive verb, then there is more care required when using it in a superficial annexation. For example, consider the following two doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjectives that are derived from transitive verbs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nظَلَمَ\nto wrong (s.o.)\nظَالِم unjust, tyrannical\n\n\nرَحِمَ\nto have mercy (on s.o.)\nرَاحِم merciful\n\n\n\nNow let’s say that we wish to use the doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective رَاحِم in a superficial annexation. Then, it is preferred that the actual direct doee of the doer participle not be mentioned. So, for example, we can say\n\nزَيْدٌ رَاحِمُ الْقَلْبِ\nZayd is merciful of heart.\n\nBut we shouldn’t say:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ رَاحِمُ الْقَلْبِ النَّاسَ\nZayd is merciful of heart to the people.\n\nSometimes, the meaning of the syntactic base noun can cause ambiguity. For example if we say:\n\nزَيْدٌ رَاحِمُ الْأَبْنَاءِ [modified from شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/104]\n\nthen there are two routes to end up with this construction:\n\nرَاحِم is a doer participle and الأَبْنَاء is its direct doee. The original sentence is:\n\nزَيْدٌ رَاحِمٌ الْأَبْنَاءَ\nZayd is/will be having mercy on the sons.\n\nرَاحِم is a doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective and الأَبْنَاء is its semantic doer. The original sentence is:\n\nزَيْدٌ رَاحِمٌ أَبْنَاؤُهُ\nZayd is merciful of sons.\ni.e. Zayd has merciful sons.\n\nThis sentence gets transformed according to the transformation of participle-like adjectives. Even though رَاحِم is derived from a transitive verb, its governee أَبْنَاء is treated as a direct doee-like governee, not as a direct doee.13 So the transformation is زَيْدٌ رَاحِمٌ أَبْنَاؤُهُ → زَيْدٌ رَاحِمٌ الْأَبْنَاءَ → زَيْدٌ رَاحِمُ الْأَبْنَاءِ.\n\nThere is actually a third route as well, where رَاحِم is an ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun. In this case the meaning would be Zayd is the merciful-one of the sons. However, this meaning is a little less likely and not very relevant to our discussion here.\nComing back to the sentence زَيْدٌ رَاحِمُ الْأَبْنَاءِ, there is no problem with using رَاحِمُ الْأَبْنَاءِ as a doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective to mean merciful of sons. But only if context makes it clear that Zayd has merciful sons, not that he is having mercy on the sons.\nSimilarly, one can use ظَالِم as a doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective instead of as a doer participle. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ ظَالِمُ الْعَبِيدِ [modified from شرح التسهيل لابن مالك 3/104]\nZayd is unjust of slaves.\n\nThis meaning can be understood when context indicates that Zayd has unjust slaves.14\nThe lexical doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective is not as common for form 1 verbs as the true participle-like adjective. But for form 2+ verbs, the doer participle crossing over to a participle-like adjective is the default mechanism to derive a participle-like adjective from the verb. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\nmeaning\ndoer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\n\n\n\n\nانْطَلَقَ\nto be let loose\nمْنْطَلِقُ اللِّسَانِ fluent of tongue [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 3/308]\n\n\nاطْمَأَنَّ\nto be tranquil\nمُطْمَئِنُّ الْقَلْبِ tranquil of heart [التذييل والتكميل لأبي حيان 3/308]\n\n\nاسْتَقَامَ\nto be upright\nمُسْتَقِيم straight\n\n\nاعْتَدَلَ\nto be moderate\nمُعْتَدِل moderate\n\n\n\n\n\n32.11.2 The ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective\nThe ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective can be created from any doer participle, on the fly, when what is intended by the doer participle is a more permanent quality. So, for example, the doer participle قَائِم can cross over to a participle-like adjective if its referent is standing more constantly than the doer participle would signify. Now it can follow the same transformation of governing a direct doee-like governee and then into a superficial annexation.15 So we can say:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمُ الْأَبِ [المساعد على تسهيل الفوائد لابن عقيل 2/222]\nZayd’s father is a stander.\n(The process of transformation is زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ → زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ الْأَبَ → زَيْدٌ قَائِمُ الْأَبِ.)\n\nBut we should not use the superficial annexation زَيْدٌ قَائِمُ الْأَبِ with the temporary meaning of the doer participle Zayd’s father is standing. This is because then قَائِم is not a participle-like adjective and thus cannot govern a direct doee-like governee.16 And it is derived from a transitive verb, so it cannot govern a true direct doee either. So we can’t say (with a temporary meaning):\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ قَائِمُ الْأَبِ غَدًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/140] Zayd’s father will stand tomorrow.\n\nWe should only say, in this case:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ غَدًا [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 3/140] Zayd’s father will stand tomorrow.\n\nAn ad hoc doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective can be formed from a transitive doer participle using the same reasoning. So we can say:\n\nزَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ الْأَبِ [المساعد على تسهيل الفوائد لابن عقيل 2/222–223]\nZayd’s father is a beater.\n\nBut one should only use such a construction when context makes it clear that Zayd’s father is the beater. Otherwise the apparent meaning, out of context, is Zayd is the beater of the father. By the way, we have already learned in section (ref) above that when a doer participle-crossover-to-participle-like adjective is derived from a transitive verb, then the true direct doee of the verb should not be used. So we shouldn’t say:\n\n✗ زَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ الْأَبِ عَمْرًا [المساعد على تسهيل الفوائد لابن عقيل 2/223]\nZayd’s father is a beater of Ɛamr.",

Sometimes this crossing over is metaphorical, such that the entity noun is used with an adjectival noun meaning. For example:\n\nمررت برجل أسد\nI passed by a lion man\n(lion is used metaphorical to mean courageous.)\n\nOthertimes, the entity noun is simply used descriptively. For example:\n\nمررت برجل عبد I passed by a slave man\n\nWhen a entity noun crosses over to a adjectival noun, then it will govern a latent doer pronoun. This doer can also be an overt sababi doer. For example:\n\nمررت برجل عبد أبوه [الكشاف للزمخشري for سورة النساء 4:172]",

    "section": "32.13 The lexical participle-like adjective-crossover-to-entity noun",
    "text": "32.13 The lexical participle-like adjective-crossover-to-entity noun\nVery often, a participle-like adjective can cross over to a entity noun.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective-crossover-to-entity noun\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nصَغِير\na baby\n\n\nكَبِير\na elder person\n\n\nصَغِيرَة\na minor sin\n\n\nكَبِيرَة\na major sin\n\n\nنَصِيحَة\nan advice\n\n\nحَسَنَة\na good deed\n\n\n\nAs with doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns when an adjectival noun crosses over to a entity noun, it loses its genderizability. For example, the feminine participle-like adjective حَسَنَة good crosses over to a entity noun to mean a good deed. Let’s use it in a sentence:\n\nٱلصِّيَامُ حَسَنَةٌ.\nFasting is a good deed.\n\nThe subject in this sentence is the masculine noun ٱَلصِّيَام fasting. And the info is the feminine noun حَسَنَة a good deed. Note that the info does not match the subject in gender. This is because it lost its genderizability since it is no longer acting as an participle-like adjective good, but rather as the entity noun a good deed.\nWhat if we have the sentence:\n\nٱَلصَّدَقَةُ حَسَنَةٌ.\n\nThe feminine gender of the subject ٱَلصَّدَقَة. charity now matches the gender of the info حَسَنَة. So now, technically, the info could be the participle-like adjective, meaning good. So the sentence could mean Charity is good.\nOr the info could be the entity noun meaning a good deed. Then the sentence would mean Charity is a good deed..\nContext would be needed to tell us which meaning is intended.\nFrequently, when a participle-like adjective can cross over to a entity noun, then it uses a different plural from the original participle-like adjective. For example, كَبِيرَة as a participle-like adjective can use the broken plural كِبَار. So we can say:\n\nالْجَوَارِي كِبَارٌ The girls are big.\n(كَبِيرات could also have been used.)\n\nBut when كَبِيرَة crosses over to a entity noun, then it will use the plural كَبَائِر. For example:\n\nهَذِهِ الْأَفْعَالُ كَبَائِرُ\nThese acts are major sins.\n\n\nThe doer participle-crossover-to-entity noun on the pattern فَعِيل\nThere is a special category of lexical doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns and that is on the pattern فَعِيل, when it has the meaning of the doee participle. Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective-crossover-to-entity noun\nmeaning\nverb\ndefinition\n\n\n\n\nقَتِيل\na killed person\nقَتَلَ\nto kill (s.o.)\n\n\nجَرِيح\na wounded person\nجَرَحَ\nto wound (s.o.)\n\n\nأَجِير\na hired person\nأَجَرَ\nto hire (s.o.)\n\n\n\nThese doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns are used under the following general guidelines:\n\nThey can be used as a attribute (by crossing back over to a adjectival noun as in section (ref) above)).\nWhen with an (explicit or implicit) noun as its referent has been previously mentioned, then only the masculine noun is used, even for feminine referents.\nWhen used without an (explicit or implicit) noun as its referent, then the feminine noun (with ة) may be used for a feminine referent.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nمررت بامرأة جريح [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 4/94]\nI passed by a wounded-person woman.\nمررت برجل جريح أبوه [المساعد على تسهيل الفوائد لابن عقيل 2/209]\nI passed by a man whose father was a wounded-person.\nرَأَيْتُ قَتِيلًا وَقَتِيلَةً\nI saw a male killed person and a female killed person.\n\nNot all participle-like adjectives with the meaning of the doee participle cross over (lexically) to entity nouns. Some remain as participle-like adjectives and then are feminized as usual. For example:\n\nرَجُلٌ حَمِيدٌ وَامْرأَةٌ حَمِيدَةٌ\na praiseworthy man and a praiseworthy woman\nرَجُلٌ ذَمِيمٌ وَامْرأَةٌ ذَمِيمَةٌ\na blameworthy man and a blameworthy woman\nحِصْنٌ مَنِيعٌ وَقَلْعَةٌ مَنِيعَةٌ\nan impregnable fort and an impregnable citadel\n\nAnother example od lexical doer participle-crossover-to-entity nouns that is on the pattern فَعِيل is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticiple-like adjective-crossover-to-entity noun\nmeaning\nverb\ndefinition\n\n\n\n\nرَهِينَة\na pledged-item\nرَهَنَ\nto pledge (s.th.)\n\n\n\nIn this case, the entity noun has a ة and can be used for both masculine and feminine referents. For example:\n\nكُلُّ غُلاَمٍ رَهِينَةٌ بِعَقِيقَتِهِ [سنن أبي داود :2837]\nEvery boy is a pledge by his Ɛaqīqah\n\nThe masculine رَهِين can also be used but it will generally retain its adjectival noun sense.17",

    "section": "32.14 Definiteness of a participle-like adjective in a superficial annexation",
    "text": "32.14 Definiteness of a participle-like adjective in a superficial annexation\nWe learned in section (ref) that the annexe noun in a superficial annexation is not made definite by a definite base noun. We saw this in example (24) مررت برجل حسنِ الوجهِ, where حَسَن in the superficial annexation remains indefinite even though it is a annexe noun to a definite base noun الْوَجْهِ. Therefore, the indefinite حَسَن is a attribute to the indefinite attributee رَجُل.\nIf the attributee is definite, then the participle-like adjective annexe noun is prefixed by ال.\n\nمررت بالرجل الحسنِ الوجهِ [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 4/116]\nمررتُ بزيدٍ الحسنِ الوجهِ، وهندٍ الجائلةِ الوِشاح [شرح ابن يعيش على المفصل 2/132]\n\nThis rule of a participle-like adjective not becoming definite because of a definite base noun is followed more strictly than for the doer participle.18 In the case of an doer participle, we saw in section (ref) that it can cross over to a entity noun in an ad hoc manner. When this happens, then it it becomes definite when it is a annexe noun to a definite base noun (section (ref)).\nBut the participle-like adjective, when it is a annexe noun to its semantic doer, cannot be understood as a real annexation. That is حَسَنُ الْوَجْهِ handsome of face can only be understood to mean that the face is handsome, never the face’s handsome-one. So we cannot, in general, say:\n\n✗ مررت بزيد حسن الوجه [دراسات في النحو للزعبلاوي 496 citing الجامي]\n\nWe would have to say مررتُ بزيدٍ الحسنِ الوجهِ instead, as in example () above.\nAll this notwithstanding, some grammarians allow, on occasion, a participle-like adjective, when a annexe noun to its semantic doer, to become definite by a definite base noun. This is by reason of aligning to the form of a real annexation. For more discussion on this, see تفسير ابن عثيمين for سورة غافر 40:3:\n\nغَافِرِ ٱلذَّنۢبِ وَقَابِلِ ٱلتَّوۡبِ شَدِیدِ ٱلۡعِقَابِ ذِی ٱلطَّوۡلِۖ لَاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَۖ إِلَیۡهِ ٱلۡمَصِیرُ [سورة غافر 40:3]\nThe forgiver of sin, acceptor of repentance, severe in punishment, owner of abundance.

It describes the verb “went” and tells us the time in which the action of going ocurred.\nIn this chapter, we will study two kinds of adverbs in Arabic: the adverb of time and the adverb of place. These two adverbs are treated together because they both describe the space (of time and place, respectedly) in which the action of a verb ocurrs. There are other kinds of adverbs as well, and we will study them in other chapters, if Allāh wills.\nThe adverb, in Arabic, is a noun that qualifies a verb. It is put in the a-state. Let’s express the above sentence in Arabic:\nThe noun يَوْم is functioning as an adverb of time. When used thus, as an adverb, we can translate it idiomatically as “one day” instead of “a day”.",

    "text": "33.2 Determining when a noun is an adverb of time or place\nThe term adverb in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns. Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs. For example, the noun يَوْم doesn’t necessarily need to be used as an adverb. It may be used, for example, as the subject of a sentence:\n\nٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.\n“The day is long.”\n\nEven when it is in the a-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. Here it is as a direct doee:\n\nأَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.\n“I wait for an easy day.”\n\nThe way that we can tell when a noun is an adevrb of time or place is if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\nThe noun is in the a-state.\nThe noun is extra, such that the sentence is complete, albeit more vague, without it.\nThe noun signifies the time or place in which the verb occurred.\n\nIn the sentence أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا, the noun يَوْم is not signify the time in which the verb أَنْتَظِرُ is ocurring. So it is not an adverb of time.\nHaving said that, there are nouns that are used exclusively or mostly as adverbs, like قَبْل “before”. So, loosely speaking, such nouns, themselves, may be referred to as adverbs.",

    "text": "33.3 The adverb or time\nThe adverb of time is more unrestricted than the adverb of place. So we will deal with it first. We have already seen an example of an adverb of time in the sentence:\n\nذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.\n“Zayd went to the market one day.”\n\nIn the above example, the adverb of time يَوْم is singular and indefinite. But an adverb of time can occur in other formations as well. For example:\nAs a definite common noun:\n\nذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ ٱلْيَوْمَ.\n“Zayd went to the market today.”\n(ٱلْيَوْم “the day” is also used to mean “today”.)\n\nWith a attribute:\n\nقَتَلْتُهُ ٱلسَّنَةَ ٱلْمَاضِيَةَ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I killed him last year.”\n\nAs a proper noun:\n\nصُمْتُ رَمَضَانَ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I fasted (the month of) Ramaḍān.”\n\nAs an annexe noun to a base noun:\n\nجِئْتُ زَمَنَ ٱلشِّتَاءِ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I came in the winter-time.”\n\nAs an annexe noun to a sentence:\n\nصَحَبْتُ صَدِيقِي يَوْمَ خَرَجْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ.\n“I accompanied my friend the day we left the city.”\n\nAs a dual or plural:\n\nتَأَمَّلْ شَهْرَيْنِ فِي ٱخْتِيَارِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذِ. [Wright 2/109D]\n“Reflect two months upon the choice of a teacher.”\nسَكَنَ فِي بَعْضِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَيَّامًا. [Wright 2/109D]\n“He stayed in one of the villages (a few) days.”\n\nThe adverb before its verb in sentence word order1:\n\nٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ [سورة المائدة 5:3]\n“This day I have perfected for you your religion”",

    "section": "33.4 The adverb of place",
    "text": "33.4 The adverb of place\nThe adverb of place is more restricted than the adverb of time. Only some nouns are suitable to function as adverbs of place. Such nouns fall under some categories that we will discuss in the next few subsections:\n\n33.4.1 Vague and unbounded nouns\nGenerally, only vague and unbounded nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place. A noun that denotes a specific place are not permitted. So, for example, we can’t use the noun بَيْت as an adverb of place to say جَلَسْتُ بَيْتًا. Instead we’ll have to use the preposition فِي and say جَلَسْتُ فِي بَيْتٍ.\nDirectional nouns are considered vague enough to be used as adverbs of place. Such nouns include:\n\nأَمَام, قُدَّام “in front (of)”\nخَلْفَ, وَرَاء “behind”\nفَوْق “above”\nتَحْت “under”, أَسْفَل “lower”, دُون “beneath”\nيَمِين “right”\nشِمَال, يَسَار “left”\n\nPermitted also are general spatial nouns including, but not limited to:\n\nوَسْط “in the middle (of)”\nحَوْل “around”\nعِنْد, لَدُنْ, لَدَىٰ “at, with, by”\nمَع “with”\nبَيْن “between”\n\nSome of the nouns above we have introduced previously in section (ref) as pseudo-prepositions. But they are actually nouns, that when used as adverbs give meanings similar to prepositions.\n\nHere is an example of the use of these nouns as adverbs of place:\n\nنَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَيَسَارًا (وَشِمَالًا) [Wright 2/111B]\n“He looked right and left.”\n\n\nGenerally, these nouns indicate place by being annexed to a base noun reference point. For example أَمَامَ ٱلْبَيْتِ “in front of the house”. When they are annexed to a definite noun then they too will be definite. But this in no way restricts their vagueness and thus ability to be used as adverbs of place.2 For example,\n\nبَايَعْنَا النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ [صحيح البخاري :7208]\n“We gave the oath of allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ under the tree”\n\n\nThere are some nouns whose meaning is associated with the word “side”:\n\nجَانِب, نَاحِيَة, وَجْه, جِهَة “side”\nدَاخِل, جَوْف “inside”\nخَارِج “outside”\n\nWith these nouns, it is more common to use prepositions like فِي, إلَىٰ, or مِنْ before them. For example,\n\nنِمْتُ فِي خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ [Wright 2/112A]\n“I slept outside the house.”\nزَيْدٌ فِي جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو.\nor\nزَيْدٌ إِلَىٰ جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو. [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/489]\n“Zayd is beside Ɛamr”\nزَيْدٌ مِنْ خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ. [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/489]\n“Zayd is outside the house.”\n\nBut there are (rare) examples of them being used as adverbs of place as well:\n\nأَتَشَوَّفُ دَاخِلًا وَخَارِجًا [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :6520]\n“I (was) looking inside and outside.”\nفَهُوَ مُتَّكِئٌ عَلَيْهَا دَاخِلَ الْمَسْجِدِ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :15837]\n“And he (was) relying on [our arms] inside the mosque”\n\n\nSome place nouns are vague in that they mean “place”, like مَكَان,  and مَقَام. These nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place when unspecified and indefinite. For example:\n\nفَتُصَلِّيَ فِي بَيْتِي مَكَانًا [سنن ابن ماجه :754]\n“that you may pray in my house (at) a place”\nوَلَكِنْ وَاللهِ لَا تَجْتَمِعُ ابْنَةُ رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، وَابْنَةُ عَدُوِّ اللهِ مَكَانًا وَاحِدًا أَبَدًا\nhttps://shamela.ws/book/25794/15437\n\nThe word مَكَان may be be annexed to a vague expression like كَذَا وَكَذَا and remain vague. For example:\n\nثُمَّ مَوْعِدُكِ مَكَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا\nhttps://shamela.ws/book/25794/21044#p1\nوَلَكِنِّي رَأَيْتُهُ انْطَلَقَ مَكَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا\nhttps://shamela.ws/book/25794/19824\n\nHowever, when these nouns are specified, typically by definiteness, then it is better that they only be used as nouns of place when construed with a verb conveying the idea of stopping or remaining. For example,\n\nجَلَسْتُ مَكَانَ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/111D]\n“I sat down in Zayd’s place.”\nامْكُثْ مَكَانَكَ [سنن أبي داود :940]\n“Stay (at) your place.”\nاجْلِسُوا مَكَانَكُمْ [صحيح البخاري :4039]\n“Sit (at) your places.”\n\nThe noun مَكَان is also used in an annexation to mean “in place of”. With this meaning, it may be used as an adverb of place unrestrictedly. For example,\n\nخُذْ هَـٰذَا مَكَانَ ذَ ٰلِكَ [النحو الوافي 2/261]\n“Take this in place of that.”\n\nSo too may the noun بَدَل “replacement” be used in this way.\n\nخُذْ هَـٰذَا بَدَلَ ذَ ٰلِكَ [النحو الوافي 2/261]\n“Take this in replacement of that.”\n\n\n\n33.4.2 Units of distance and space\nUnits of distance and space are permitted to be used as adverbs of place. For example:\n\n\nسَارُوا مِيلًا\n“They travelled a mile.”\nمَشَيْتُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ [Wright 2/111B]\n“I walked two parasangs.”\n(A فَرْسَخْ is a unit of distance approximately equal to three miles.)\nجَرَىٰ غَلْوَةً [Wright 2/111B]\n“He ran the distance of a bowshot.”\n\n\n\n\n33.4.3 Nouns of place\nIn section (ref) we studied the noun of place, which is formed on the pattern مَفْعِل or مَفْعَل. The noun of place is permitted to be used as an adverb of place, but only when construed with the verb from which it is derived. For example,\n\nقَعَدْتُ مَقْعَدَ زَيْدٍ,\nجَلَسْتُ مَجْلِسَ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/112A]\nI sat down in Zayd’s seat.\nرَأَى النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبًا مُوَاجِهًا لِلْقِبْلَةِ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :5741]\n“He saw the Prophet ﷺ going a path facing towards the qiblah.”\n\nAlso included in this category are the vague place nouns (like مَكَان, مَوْضِع, and مَقَام) annexed to the verb’s maṣdar. They may occur as adverbs of place instead of the verb’s actual noun of place. For example,\n\nقاتلت موضع القتال [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I fought (in) the place of fighting.”\n\nSome grammarians allow using the noun of place of one verb as an adverb of place with another verb, when both verbs are close in meaning, or when one verb is used with the meaning of another verb.3 So according to these grammarians, we can say:\n\nجَلَسْتُ مَجْلِسَ زِيدٍ [البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة التوبة 9:5]\nقَعَدْتُ مَجْلِسَ زِيدٍ [البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة التوبة 9:5]\n“I sat (in) Zayd’s seat.”\n\nAccording to other grammarians, it is the meaning of remaining stopped (in either the verb or the noun of place) that allows freedom in mixing and matching verbs and nouns of place.4 So according to these grammarians, we can say:\n\nجلست موضع القيام [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I sat in the place of standing.”\nتحركت مكان السكون [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I moved in the place of resting.”\nقعدت موضعك [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I sat in your place.”\nجلست منزل فلان [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I sat in the so-and-so’s place of alighting.”\nنمت مبيته [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I slept in his place of spending the night.”\n\n\n\n33.4.4 Gray area in vagueness\nThere is actually considerable difference of opinion among the grammarians with regard to which nouns are permissible as adverbs of place. We got a taste of this in the previous section with respect of nouns of place as adverbs. Most of this disagreement centers around whether a noun is sufficiently vague. Consider the following example:\n\nٱقْتُلُوا یُوسُفَ أَوِ ٱطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضًا [سورة يوسف 12:9]\n“Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land;”\n\nThe noun أَرْضًا is in the a-state. Our first thought would be that it is an adverb of place. However, in the tafsīr of this āyah, scholars have differed with regard to how to analyze أَرْضًا.\nSome do analyze it as an adverb of place.5. Others deem the noun أَرْضًا not vague enough to be an adverb of place. 6 Other analyses are then proposed like it’s being in the a-state is due to the dropping of a preposition (see (ref)) or because the verb ٱطْرَح “to cast” is used with the meaning of another (transitive) verb (section (ref)) like أَوْدِع “to deposit”.\n\n\n33.4.5 Irregular adverbs of place\nThere are some examples of adverbs of place that don’t align with the examples that we have given. They are considered irregular adverbs of place. We will list these irregular adverbs of place below:\nThe verbs دَخَلَ “to enter”, سَكَنَ “to dwell”, and نَزَلَ “to alight” may govern place nouns in the a-state without an intermediate preposition.7 So we can say:\n\nدَخَلْتُ ٱلدَّارَ\n“I entered the house,”\nسَكَنْتُ ٱلْبَيْتَ\n“I dwelled (in) the house,”\nنَزَلْتُ ٱلْبَلَدَ\n“I alighted (in) the country.”\n\nAlso permitted is the country name ٱلشَّأْم “Syria” with the verb ذَهَبَ “to go.” So we can say:\n\nذَهَبْتُ ٱلشَّأْمَ\n“I went (to) Syria.”\n\nSome grammarians consider the nouns governed by these verbs as direct doees, whereas others consider them adverbs of place.8\nThe expressions below are also irregular in that they contain specific, i.e. non-vague, adverbs of place:\n\nمُطِرْنَا ٱلسَّهْلَ وَٱلْجَبَلَ\nقُلِبَ زَيْدٌ ٱلظَّهْرَ وَٱلْبَطْنَ",

    "text": "33.5 The deputy adverb of time and place\nThe adverb of time or place may be substituted by another noun. This other noun then becomes the adverb in the a-state as the deputy of the original adverb. The meaning of the original (substituted) adverb is then implied. The substitute may be from the following categories:\n\n33.5.1 A qualifier\nWhen an adverb of time or place is qualified by another noun, then the adverb may be dropped and the qualifier may take its place.9\nSuch qualifiers include:\n\nA attribute:\n\nجلست شرقي الدار [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I sat east of the house.”\n(for جلست مَكَانًا شرقي الدار)\nجَلَسْتُ عِنْدَهُ طَوِيلًا مِنَ ٱلدَّهْرِ [Wright 2/110B]\n“I sat with him (for) a long (time).” (for زَمَنًا طَوِيلًا)\n\nA number:\n\nسَارُوا أَرْبَعَةَ أَمْيالٍ [Wright 2/111B]\n“They travelled four miles.”\n(Technically the number أَرْبَعَة is the adverb in the a-state.)\n\nA fraction or a whole:\n\nلَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [سورة المؤمنون 23:113]\n“We remained a day or part of a day”\n\nA pointing noun:\n\nجئت هذا الوقت [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I came (at) this time.”\nخرج محمد هذه الساعة [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“Muḥammad left (at) this hour.”\nسرت هذه المسافة [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I travelled this distance.”\n\n\n\n\n33.5.2 A maṣdar\nA maṣdar may substitute an adverb of time or place if:\n\nthe meaning “at the time of” or “the amount of time of” is implied for adverb of time;\nand the meaning “at the place of” “the amount of space of” is implied for the adverb of place.\n\nExamples:\n\nجَاءَ طُلُوعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ [Wright 2/110C]\n“He came (at the time of) the rising of the sun.”\n(for جَاءَ وَقْتَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ)\nجِئْتُ صَلَاةَ ٱلْعَصْرِ [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I came (at the time of) the ɛaṣr prayer.”\n(for جِئْتُ وَقْتَ صَلَاةِ ٱلْعَصْرِ.)\nٱنْتَظَرْتُهُ حَلْبَ نَاقَةٍ [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I waited for him (the amount of time of) the milking of a she-camel.”\n(for ٱنْتَظَرْتُهُ مِقْدَارَ حَلْبِ نَاقَةٍ\nجَلَسْتُ قُرْبَ زَيْدٍ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 2/200]\n“I sat near Zayd.”\n(literally: “I sat (at the place of) the nearness of Zayd.”)\n\nThis substitution by a maṣdar is more common for the adverb of time than for the adverb of place.10",

    "section": "33.6 Using prepositions instead of adverbs of time and place",
    "text": "33.6 Using prepositions instead of adverbs of time and place\nOften we can replace a noun used as an adverb of time or place by a preposition followed by the same noun. This preposition is usually فِي. For example, instead of saying: خَرَجْتُ يَوْمًا مَاطِرًا “I left (on) a rainy day,” we can say:\n\nخَرَجْتُ فِي يَوْمٍ مَاطِرٍ\n“I left (on) a rainy day.”\n(literally “in a rainy day”.)\n\nThe noun يَوْم is technically no longer an adverb since it is not in the a-state. The preposition فِي signifies that the verb occurs in the time or place denoted by the adverb. So, in the example above, my act of leaving ocurred in a time which is denoted by “a rainy day”. In cases like the example above, the choice of whether to use an adverb or preposition is a matter of style, and is up to the speaker.\nNote, however, that this substitution with فِي is not always literally correct.11 For example, we can’t say \\(\\times\\) طار الطائر في فوق الشجرة for “The bird flew above the tree.” Instead we have to say طار الطائر فوق الشجرة. Nevertheless, the idea of فِي is still correct in that the bird flew in the space which is above the tree.\nAnd sometimes, if we substitute a noun used as an adverb with فِي followed by the noun, then the sentence may be grammatically correct, but with a different meaning from the original. Consider the following examples:\n\nفَعَلْتُ هَـٰذَا سَبْعَةَ أَيَّامٍ [معاني النحو 2/179]\n“I did this (for) seven days.”\nفَعَلْتُ هَـٰذَا فِي سَبْعَةِ أَيَّامٍ [معاني النحو 2/179]\n“I did this (in) seven days.”\n\nExample (60) indicates that I did an action repeatedly during seven days. Whereas example (61) indicates that I did the action once, and it took seven days to complete the action.\nSimilarly, consider these two examples:\n\nأَدْرُسُ ٱللَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ [معاني النحو 2/181]\n“I study night and day.”\nأَدْرُسُ فِي ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ [معاني النحو 2/181]\n“I study in the night and day.”\n\nExample (62) is about the amount of time that I study. This is the answer to “How much do you study?” Whereas example (63) is about the period of time during which I study. This is the answer to “When do you study?”\n\n33.6.1 Using other prepositions besides فِي\nWhile فِي is the most general preposition for substituting an adverb, other prepositions are also used. This often depends on the adverb itself. For example, instead of saying أَخْرُجُ غَدًا for “I will leave tomorrow,” we can say:\n\nأَخْرُجُ بِالْغَدِ\n“I will leave tomorrow”\n\nAnd instead of saying نَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا for “He looked right and left,” we can say:\n\nنَظَرَ عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ ٱلشِّمَالِ\n“He looked right and left.”\n\nOne common preposition used before a class of adverbs is مِنْ. We will discuss it separately in the next section below.",

    "section": "33.7 Using مِنْ before some adverbs",
    "text": "33.7 Using مِنْ before some adverbs\nThere are some nouns that are used as adverbs, but are also used with the preposition مِنْ to give the same adverbial meaning. Some of these nouns are عِنْد, لَدُن “by, with”, قَبْل “before”, بَعْد “after”, فَوْق “above”, تَحْت “under”,12 etc.\nOften times, مِنْ signifies its literal meaning “from”, as usual. For example:\n\nمَكَثْتُ عِنْدَكَ سَاعَةً ثُمَّ خَرَجُتُ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِي [النحو الوافي 2/262]\n“I stayed at your [place] an hour, then I left from your place to my house.”\n\nOther times, the significance of this مِنْ is less obvious. Consider the following examples:\n\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرآنَ بَعْدَ صَلَاةَ ٱلْعَصْرِ\n“I read the Qurʾān after the ɛaṣr prayer.”\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرآنَ مِنْ بَعْدِ صَلَاةِ ٱلْعَصْرِ\n“I read the Qurʾān (during a time which starts) from after the ɛaṣr prayer.”\n\nExample (68) specifies the beginning of the time period that is indicated by the adverb. Technically, this is not necessarily when the action of the verb began. But this usage of مِنْ could be used to signify that the action started very close to the beginning of the time period. That is, it could indicate that I started to read the Qurʾān right after the ɛaṣr prayer.13 Often, when the meaning of مِنْ is subtle, it is not translated as “from”. For example:\n\nلِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ مِنْ بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا [سورة الحج 22:5]\n“so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing”\nلِكَيْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النحل 16:70]\n“so that he will not know, after [having had] knowledge, a thing”\n\nSometimes it may be left untranslated.",

    "text": "33.8 قَبْل and its sisters\nThere are a class of nouns, which are usually adverbs of time and place, that are sometimes flexible, and sometimes rigid. These nouns are:\n\nقَبْل “before”\nبَعْد “after”\nدُون “beneath”,\nأَسْفَل “lower”\nفَوْق “above”\nتَحْت “under”\nأَمَام, قُدَّام “in front”\nخَلْف, وَرَاء “behind”\nعَلُ, عَلْو, “on top”\nأَوَّل “first”\n\nAlso usually included with these are14:\n\nيَمِين “right”\nشِمَال “left”\nآخِر “last”\n\nCollectively, we will call them قَبْل and its sisters.\nWe have already seen some of these being used used as adverbs of time or place. The cases for determining when they are flexible and when rigid are as follows:\n\nWhen used as annexe nouns with a mentioned base noun: When used as annexe nouns then قَبْل and its sisters are flexible. For example,\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ ٱلْجَيْشِ\n“The commander stood in front of the army”\n\nAs we’ve previously discussed, instead of using these nouns as adverbs, it is common to also precede them with a preposition, like مِنْ. For example:\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ ٱلْجَيْشِ\n“The commander stood in front of the army”\n\nIn this case, whether قَبْل or one of its sisters is an adverb in the a-state, or following a preposition in the i-state, then it is flexible. This is indicated in the examples above by the fat·ḥah on its ending when in the a-state, and the kasrah when in the i-state.\nWhen used as annexe nouns but the base noun is not mentioned: Rarely, for stylistic reasons, the base noun in sentences like the example above is dropped. But the presence of the base noun is intended by the speaker. In such cases, the annexe noun will be flexible and without tanwīn. For example:\n\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ\n“The commander stood in front [of the army]”\n\n\nMore commonly, the base noun is deleted, both in expression and in intention, but the adverb is still understood to be bounded implicitly. In this case, قَبْل and its sisters will be rigid. Their ending will have a ḍammah regardless of whether they are in the a-state (as an adverb) or in the i-state (following مِنْ). For example:\n\n\nقَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامُ\n\nقَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامُ\n“The army arrived, and the commander stood in front (of the army)”\n\n\nThis usage is quite common. Much more so than case b. where the base noun is dropped only stylistically.\nLastly, قَبْل and its sisters may occur as indefinite nouns without an implicit or explicit base noun. They then have an absolute and unbounded meaning. In this case, they are flexible.  For example,\n\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامًا\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامٍ\n“The commander stood in front”\n\n\nIn the example above, we can see that أَمًام is a flexible noun due to its tanwīn. \n\nThe difference in meaning between some of these cases is quite subtle. In practice, cases a. and c. are more common. And case b. is rare.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nيُخْرِجُ غِلْمَانَهُ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَلَا يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ ذِي الْحُلَيْفَةِ، يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ أَمَامِ ذَلِكَ [مصنف ابن أبي شيبة :14178]\n“He would take his (slave) boys out for the Ḥajj. But they would not enter iḥrām from D͡hu l-Ḥulayfah; they would enter iḥrām from before that [location].”\n\nThe words أَوَّل and أَسْفَل also have some rules that are specific to them and we will treat them separately in section (ref).",

    "text": "33.10 Multiple adverbs of place with a single verb\n\n33.10.1 Multiple adverbs with conjunctions\nIt is possible for multiple adverbs to be used with a single verb. This is regularly done with using particles like وَ and فَ. For example:\n\nٱلْتَمَسْتُهُ لَيْلًا وَنَهَارًا\n“I searched for it night and day”\nلَقِيتُهُ صَبَاحًا فَمَسَاءً [معاني النحو 2/202 (referencing الرضي)]\n“I met him evening after morning.”\n(i.e., every morning and evening.)\nلَقِيتُهُ يَوْمًا فَيَوْمًا\n“I met him day after day.”\n\n\n\n33.10.2 Multiple adverbs without conjunctions\nIf particles like وَ and فَ are not used then multiple adverbs may be used for one verb in one of the following cases15:\n\nWhen one is an adverb of time and the other an adverb of place. For example:\n\nٱجْلِسْ عِنْدِي سَاعَةً\n“Sit with me an hour.” (عِنْد is an adverb of place and سَاعَة is a adverb of time.)\n\nWhen both are adverbs of the same kind:\n\nWhen the second adverb is a replacement for the first. For example:\n\nأُقَابِلُكَ يَومَ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ ظُهْرًا [النحو الوافي 2/255]\n“I will meet you Friday afternoon.”\n(ظُهْر is a replacement for يَوْم and specifies when on Friday.)\n\nWhen the adverb is a comparative noun (see chapter (ref)). For example:\n\nٱلْمَرِيضُ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ أَمْسِ [النحو الوافي 2/256]\n“The patient today is better than he (was) yesterday.”\n\n\n\n\n\n33.10.3 Compound adverbs\nInstead of using particles like وَ and فَ between adverbs, compound adverbs may be formed. There are two ways to form a compound adverb:16\n\nBoth adverbs end with a fat·ḥah without tanwīn. For example,\n\nلَقِيتُهُ يَوْمَ يَوْمَ\n“I met him day after day.”\n\nThe adverbs form an annexation. For example,\n\nتَزُورُنَا صَبَاحَ مَسَاءٍ [النحو الوافي 2/271]\n“You visit us morning and night.”\n\n\nBoth options can be used more or less interchangeably. Unless there is a compound adverb with a set meaning. For example:\n\nدَرَجَةُ حَرَارَةِ ٱلْجَوِّ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ\n“The degree of the temperature of the air is intermediate.”",

    "text": "33.11 Some commonly used adverbs of time and place\n\n33.11.1 هُنَا and هُنَاكَ\n\n\n33.11.2 أَسْفَل\nأَسْفَل is actually a comparative noun, meaning “lower”. And even when it is used as an adverb of place, it is with this comparative meaning.17\nMost of the directional nouns, like أَمَام, خَلْفَ, وَرَاء, فَوْق, and تَحْت are used as annexe nouns. For example, فَوْقَ ٱلْأَرْضِ means “above the Earth.”\nWe have learned that comparative nouns are used with the the preposition مِنْ to express their “-er” meaning. For example أَكْبَرُ مِنْ ٱلْبَيْتِ “bigger than the house.” They may also be used as annexe nouns to express their “-est” meaning. For example, أَكْبَرُ بَيْتٍ, أَكْبَرُ ٱلْبُيُوتِ “biggest house.”\nأَسْفَل too may be used in both these formations. We will discuss them below:\n\n33.11.2.1 أَسْفَل used before مِنْ\nUsually أَسْفَل is used with مِنْ to express the adverb of place “lower (than)”  Here are some examples of أَسْفَل, as an adverb of place:\n\nوَٱلرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ 18 [سورة الأنفال 8:42]\n“and the caravan was lower [in position] than you”\nزَيْدٌ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكَ [كتاب سيبويه 3/289]\n“Zayd is lower than you.”\nوَضَعَ رَاحَتَيْهِ عَلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ وَجَعَلَ أَصَابِعَهُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ [سنن النسائي :1036]\n“He put his palms on his knees and put his fingers lower than that.”\nنَهَى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ أَنْ يَقُومَ الْإِمَامُ فَوْقَ شَيْءٍ وَالنَّاسُ خَلْفَهُ يَعْنِي أَسْفَلَ مِنْهُ [مشكاة المصابيح :1692]\n“The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ forbade that the imām should stand on anything when the people are behind him, meaning lower than him.”\n\n\nNote, in the examples above, that أَسْفَل does not have tanwīn. This is because it is a semi-flexible noun.\nNow, in the case of قَبْل and its sisters we saw that their rigidity and flexibility is determined by whether or not they are annexe nouns and if they have base nouns in an annexation.\nBut أَسْفَل, when used with before مِنْ as an adverb of place, is not an annexe noun.  So its rigidity and flexibility is determined by whether or not it is compared to a noun (with مِنْ):\nIf the adverb of place أَسْفَل is followed by مِنْ and a compared noun, then it is flexible. By the way, there may be another مِنْ before أَسْفَل as well, as we learned in section (ref). Here is an example,\n\nإِذْ جَاءُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [سورة الأحزاب 33:10]\n“[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you”\n\nAnd if the adverb of place أَسْفَل is not followed by مِنْ and a compared noun, but the adverb is still understood to be bounded implicitly, then it will be rigid ending with a ḍammah. For example:\n\nوَقَالَ بِأَصَابِعِهِ وَرَفَعَهَا إِلَى فَوْقُ وَطَأْطَأَ إِلَى أَسْفَلُ [صحيح البخاري :621]\n“and he gestured with his fingers and raised them up upward and lowered [them] downward.”\nوالطَّفْرُ وَثْبٌ مِنْ أسْفَلُ الى فَوْقُ [فقه اللغة للثعالبي 137]\n“and aṭṭafr is a leap from down to up.”\n\n\n\n33.11.2.2 أَسْفَل as an annexe noun\nMost of the time, we will want to say that something is below or lower than another thing. In this case, we will use أَسْفَل مِنْ as we have described above.\nHowever, sometimes, we may want to say that something is at the lowest place. In this case, we can use أَسْفَل as an annexe noun to be an adverb of place.19\nFor example,\n\nنَعْلُكَ أَسْفَلُ رِجْلِكَ [النحو الوافي 1/484]\n“Your sandal is (at) the lowest [part] of your foot.”\n(Note the partitive meaning of أَسْفَل annexed to a singular base noun.)\n\n\n\n33.11.2.3 Non-adverbial use of أَسْفَل\nBy the way, أَسْفَل need not always be an adverb of place. It may be used like other common nouns. In the following example, it is the doer of a verb and also an annexe noun.\n\nلَمْ تَبْتَلَّ أَسْفَلُ نِعَالِهِمْ [سنن أبي داود :1059]\n“The lower [part] of their sandals did not get wet.”\n\n\n\n\n33.11.3 أَوَّل\nأَوَّل is used as an adverb of time, meaning “first”\nMuch of what we have said about أَسْفَل applies also to the noun أَوَّل.\nHowever there is some difference from أَسْفَل:\n\nThe meaning of “first” is inherently superlative. In English we dont say that something is more first than another thing. We can try to capture this meaning by translating it as “prior to”.\nأَوَّل, despite being on the pattern أَفْعَل, is irregular in that it can take tanwīn when used in an absolute and unbounded sense.\n\n\n33.11.3.1 أَوَّل used before مِنْ\nأَوَّل is a semi-flexible noun when used with مِنْ:\n\nلاَ تَسْأَلْهُ عَنْ شَىْءٍ أَوَّلَ مِنْ حَدِيثِ الشَّفَاعَةِ [صحيح البخاري :7510]\n“Don’t ask him about anything prior to the ḥadīt͡h of intercession”\nلاَ تَبْتَدِئَانِ بِشَىْءٍ أَوَّلَ مِنَ الْبَيْتِ، تَطُوفَانِ بِهِ [صحيح البخاري :1641]\n“They2f would not begin with anything prior to the House, performing the ṭawāf around it.”\n\nWhen مِنْ is not used but أَوَّل is implicitly bounded then it is rigid with a ḍammah on its ending:\n\nأَىُّ الْقُرْآنِ أُنْزِلَ أَوَّلُ [صحيح البخاري :4924]\n“Which [part] of the Qurʾān was revealed first (of all the sūrahs)?”\nأَىُّ مَسْجِدٍ وُضِعَ أَوَّلُ [سنن ابن ماجه :753]\n“Which mosque was established first (of all the mosques)?”\n\nWhen أَوَّل, is used in an absolute and unbounded sense, then it takes tanwīn despite being on the pattern أَفْعَل:\n\nيَبْتَدِرُونَهَا أَيُّهُمْ يَكْتُبُهَا أَوَّلًا [سنن النسائي :1062]\n“They (were) rushing (to see) which of them would write it first”\nوَأَمَّا الدَّارُ الَّتِي دَخَلْتَ أَوَّلًا فَدَارُ عَامَّةِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :20165]\n“And as for the house that you entered first, it was for the common people of the Muslims.”\nأَيُّهُمَا جَاءَ أَوَّلًا عَمِلَ عَمَلَهُ [مشكاة المصابيح :1700]\n“Which of them came first [that] did his deed?”\n\n\n\n33.11.3.2 أَوَّل as an annexe noun\nLike أَسْفَل, when أَوَّل can be used as an annexe noun as well, even when it is an adverb of time. For example\n\nكَانَ يَنَامُ أَوَّلَ اللَّيْلِ [صحيح مسلم :739]\n“He used to sleep the first [part] of the night”\n\nThe usage of أَوَّل as an annexe noun when it is an adverb of time is probably not as uncommon as it is for أَسْفَل.\n\n\n33.11.3.3 Non-adverbial use of أَوَّل\nJust like أَسْفَل, أَوَّل need not be used adverbially. Here it is as the info of a sentence and an annexe noun:\n\nوَأَنَا أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِینَ [سورة الأنعام 6:163]\n“and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.”\n\nEven when used non-adverbially, أَوَّل may take tanwīn. For example, here it is the subject of إنَّ in the a-state:\n\nإِنَّ لِلصَّلَاةِ أَوَّلًا وَآخِرًا [جامع الترمذي :151]\n“Indeed the prayer has a first [time] and a last [time]”\n\n\n\n\n33.11.4 بَعْد\n\nused for time and place\nmeaning “yet”\n\n\n\n33.11.5 ذَات",

Whereas, the absolute doee can occur for any verb, whether transitive or intransitive Also, the absolute doee is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter, if Allāh wills.\nThe absolute doee is used for the following purposes:",

    "section": "34.3 The qualifying absolute doee",
    "text": "34.3 The qualifying absolute doee\nWith regard to the meaning of the governing verb, the qualifying absolute doee indicates either what kind was intended, or its quantity, or both.\nThe kind of the maṣdar is frequently used with a attribute or in an annexation. For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/54A]\n“I beat him (with) a severe beating.”\nضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَ ٱلظَّالِمِ [Wright 2/54B]\n“He beat him (with) the beating of an oppressor.”\n\nSuch a qualifying absolute doee may also be signified simply with the definite article ٱل.4. For example, if a specific kind of beating is known before-hand to both the speaker and addressee, then the speaker may simply say:\n\nأَضْرِبُهُ ٱلضَّرْبَ\n“I will beat him (with) the beating.”\n\nThe qualifying maṣdar may also be annexed to a pronoun referring to the doer of the verb. For example,\n\nضَرَبَ ضَرْبَهُ\n“He beat him (with) his beating”\n\nThe quantity of the maṣdar often uses the one-time noun. It may be dualized or pluralized. For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرَبْةً وَضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ أَوْ ضَرَبَاتٍ [Wright 2/53D]\n“I beat him one blow and he beat me two blows or (three or more) blows.”\n\nSome maṣdars themselves end with a ة, like تِلَاوَة, so they are readily dualized or pluralized5 (to the sound āt plural) without resorting to the one-time noun. For example,\n\nتَلَا ٱلْقَارِئُ تِلَاوَاتٍ\n“The reader recited recitations.”\n\nBut in reality, when a maṣdar is dualized or pluralized in this manner, it seems to leave its maṣdar meaning, which is purely a verbal meaning, and begins to denote a regular (non-verbal) noun.6 So تِلَاوَات will denote, not so much the actions of reciting but kinds of recitations.\nThe same goes for maṣdars that don’t end with a ة but for whom a broken plural has been recorded from Classical Arabic, like عُلُوم, which is the plural of عِلْم “knowledge”, and وُعُود which is the plural of وَعْد “promise”.\nSo we can say:\n\nوَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا\n“I promised you promises.”\n\nوُعُود here refers to different kinds or occasions of promises, rather than the purely verbal actions of promising.7\nPlurals have not been recorded for all maṣdars. For example, ضَرْب does not have a recorded plural for its maṣdar meaning of “beating”.\nSo can we pluralize it if we wish to say “I beat him (many) kinds of beatings”? Some authorities allow us to form a new broken plural if there is a need.8 So according to them we should be able to coin a new plural ضُرُوب9 “beatings” and say,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضُرُوبًا\n“I beat him (many kinds of) beatings”\n\nOther authorities are more conservative and would only allow using broken plurals for existing meanings of words if one has been recorded for them. Following this opinion, we might then say:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ أَنْوَاعًا مِنَ ٱلضَّرْبِ\n“I beat him (many) kinds of beatings”\n\nIn any case, any maṣdar may at least be dualized to indicate the kinds of its action.10 So we can say:\n\nضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ [Wright 2/55D]\n“He beat me two (kinds of) beatings.”\nor\n“He beat me (on) two (occasions of) beatings.”\n\nBy the way, you should be able to see that saying ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ is different from if we had said\n\nضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ\n“He beat me (with) two blows.”\n\nThe former signifies the kinds or occasions of beating whereas the latter indicates the number of individual acts of beating.\nBy the way, for maṣdars that themselves end with ة, if we wish to specify that the action ocurred only once, we cannot, of course, form a one-time noun by appending another ة to it. In such a case, we may qualify the maṣdar with the attribute وَاحِدَة “once”. For example:\n\nرَحِمَهُ رَحْمَةً وَاحِدَةً [Wright 1/123C]\n“He took one mercy upon him.”\n\nIt is also important to mention that the qualifying absolute doee includes the reinforcing meaning.11 We cannot use the qualifying absolute doee without also emphasizing the meaning of the verb. For example,\n\nفَٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا [سورة المعارج 70:5]\n“So be patient with gracious patience”\n\nIn section (ref), we will see that in order to only qualify the verb without emphasizing it, we can substitute the verb with the absolute doee which then becomes a deputy to the verb.12\nFinally, the qualifying absolute doee may qualify both the kinds and quantity of the meaning of the verb. For example:\n\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ قِرَاءَتَيْنِ نَافِعَتَيْنِ [النحو الوافي 2/209]\n“I read the book two useful readings.”",

    "section": "34.4 The deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee",
    "text": "34.4 The deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee\nFrequently, instead of using the maṣdar as the absolute doee directly, it is substituted by another word. This word is then called the deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee because it fulfils the absolute doee’s role. The maṣdar may still figure in the expression. It will just not technically be the absolute doee, because the first a-state doee in that position is now its deputy.\nThe deputy to the maṣdar can be one of several categories:\n\nA attribute to a deleted maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/54A]\n“I beat him severely.”\n(for ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا “I beat him a severe beating.”)\nسِرْتُ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ [أوضح المسالك إلى ألفية ابن مالك لابن هشام 2/184]\n“I travelled the best (kind) of travelling.”\n(for سِرْتُ ٱلسَّيْرِ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ)\n\nWhen the maṣdar is thus substituted with its attribute, then the masculine adjectival noun is typically used for the attribute, even if the maṣdar was a feminine noun. For example:\n\nكَتَبُوا سَرِيعًا\n“They wrote quickly.”\n(for كَتَبُوا كِتَابَةً سَرِيعَةً)\n\nThis is because even when maṣdars end with a feminine marker, they are abstract enough in their meaning that when they are absent, only the idea of them retains influence, not their actual wording. And because that abstract idea is not feminine in its meaning, it doesn’t cause the attribute to match the feminine wording of the maṣdar in gender. So, by default, the masculine adjectival noun is used for the attribute.\nAlso, the a-state adjectival noun in such phrases as ضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا may, where the sense allows or requires it, be a deputy to the adverb of time instead of a deputy to the absolute doee.13 For example: سَارُوا طَوِيلًا “They travelled a long time,” (for سَارُوا زَمَنًا طَوِيلًا. See section (ref).)\nIn fact, according to some authorities, when the a-state noun in such phrases could be applied to both a deleted absolute doee or a deleted adverb of time (or, for that matter, other a-state functions like a direct doee), then it is possible that both meanings could be intended.14 For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ كَثِيرًا\n“I beat him a lot.”\n\nThis sentence could mean, at the same time, both ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا كَثِيرًا “I beat him a lot [of beatings],” and ضَرَبْتُهُ زَمَنًا كَثِيرًا “I beat him (for) a lot [of time].”\n\n\nAn entity noun→maṣdar\nThe entity noun→maṣdar may be a regular common noun that is used in place of a verb’s maṣdar (see (ref)).\nFor example:\n\nفَرَجَعَ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَسْلِمُوا فَإِنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يُعْطِي عَطَاءً لاَ يَخْشَى الْفَاقَةَ [صحيح مسلم :2312a]\n“So he returned to his people and said, ‘O my people, embrace Islām for indeed Muḥammad gives a gift not fearing want.’”\n(عَطَاء “gift” is a entity noun→maṣdar for the actual maṣdar إِعْطَاء.)\nٱنْهَزَمُوا هَزِيمَةً شَنِيعَةً\n[Wright 2/56B]\n“They were defeated an atrocious defeat”\n(The maṣdar of ٱنْهَزَمَ is properly ٱنْهِزَام)\n\nAlso falling under the category of entity noun→maṣdar is the maṣdar of another form of the verb from the same root.15. For example:\n\nٱقْتَتَلُوا قِتَالًا شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/56B]\n“They fought with one another a hard fight”\n(قِتَال is properly the maṣdar of the form 3 verb قَاتَلَ)\nوَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلًا [سورة المزمل 73:8]\n“and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion”\n(تَبْتِيل is properly the maṣdar of the form 2 verb بَتَّلَ)\n\n\n\nA synonymous maṣdar from a different root\nFor example:\n\nجَلَسَ قُعُودًا [Wright 2/56C]\n“I sat (with) a sitting”\n\n\n\nA noun that indicates the type of maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nرَجَعَ ٱاْقَهْقَرَىٰ [Wright 2/56C]\n“He returned walking backwards.”\nقَهْقَرَىٰ is a noun which means “backward walk”.\n\n\n\nA noun of manner of the pattern فِعْلَة\nFor example:\n\nمشى القط مشية الأسد [النحو الوافي 2/218]\n“The cat walked (with) the gait of a lion”\n\n\n\nThe number of the maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثَ ضَرَبَاتٍ\n“I beat him three blows”\n\nThe maṣdar may also be omitted from the base noun such that only the number remains. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثًا\n“I beat him three (blows)”\n(Note the feminine number ثَلَاث instead of the masculine ثَلَاثَة because the deleted base noun will be feminine in such circumstances.)\n\n\n\nA partial or whole fraction\nWords like كُلّ, جَمِيع “all”; بَعْض “some”; نِصْف, شَطْر “half”, etc. can be used to indicate how much of an action is done.\nFor example:\n\nفَلَا تَيِيلُوا كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ [سورة النساء 4:129]\n“So do not incline completely [toward one]”\nأَهْمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ بَعْضَ ٱلْإِهْمَالِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/452]\n“The student was negligent somewhat”\n\nIncluded in this category is the word شَيْء “thing”. When used in the a-state governed by a verb it can signify the meaning “a bit” or “somewhat”, etc.16 For example:\n\nفَسَارَ عَلِيٌّ شَيْـًٔا ثُمَّ وَقَفَ [صحيح مسلم :2405]\n“So Ɛaliyy went a bit, then he stopped”\n\nThe a-state noun شَيْـًٔا isn’t always a absolute doee after a verb. It may be, depending on the meaning of the sentence, a direct doee. For example, in the وَجَدْتُ شَيْـًٔا “I found something.” However, in some circumstances, شَيْـًٔا may make sense both as an absolute doee and as a direct doee.17 For example:\n\nوَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النساء 4:36]\n“and associate nothing with Him”\n\nRegarding this āyah, the mufassir Ibn Ɛās͡hūr says:\n\nشَيْـًٔا is in the a-state due to its being a [direct] doee for تُشْرِكُوا, i.e. “Don’t make a partner anything from what is worshipped”, similar to His saying, ولَنْ نُشْرِكَ بِرَبِّنا أحَدًا [سورة الجن 72:2] (“And we will never associate with our Lord anyone”).\nAnd it is permissible that شَيْـًٔا is in the a-state due to its being [a deputy to] the maṣdar, i.e. “a bit of associating even if it is slight”, similar to His saying, فَلَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْـًٔا [سورة المائدة 5:42] (“never will they harm you at all.”).18\n\n\n\n\nThe instrument or implement used in the action\nThe type of action may be indicated with the the instrument or implement used in the action. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ سَوْطًا [Wright 2/56D]\n“I beat him (with) a whip.”\n(for ضَرْبَ سَوْطٍ)\n\n\n\nA pronoun\nA absolute doee can be substituted by a pronoun that refers to it.19 For example:\n\nأَحْسَنَ ٱلْإِكْرَامَ وَأَكْرَمَهُ ضَيْفَهُ\n“He perfected generosity and was generous (with it) [to] his guest.”\n(i.e., he was generous with the generosity)\n\n\n\nA pointing noun\nSimilar to the pronoun as a deputy maṣdar absolute doee, a pointing noun may be used in the same vein. For example\n\nٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُهَذَّبُ لاَ يُعَامِلُ ٱلنَّاسَ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْمُعَامَلَةَ [النحو الواضح لعلي الجارم 2/159]\n“The refined man does not deal with the people (with) this dealing.”\nيَحْفَظُونَ أَسْرَارَهُمْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْحِفْظَ [Wright 2/54A]\n“They keep their secrets (with) this keeping”\n(i.e. so carefully)",

    "section": "34.6 The absolute doee as a deputy of the deleted governing verb",
    "text": "34.6 The absolute doee as a deputy of the deleted governing verb\nIn some cases, the deleted governing verb is replaced by the absolute doee. The absolute doee is then a deputy of the deleted verb. This can be done in the following circumstances:\n\n34.6.1 The absolute doee as a deputy of the verb in a command or supplication\nFor example, instead of using the verb of command ٱصْبِرُوا “Be patient,” one may say:\n\nصَبْرًا\n“Patience”\n\nIn terms of governance, the complete sentence is ٱصْبِرُوا صَبْرًا.  The sentence ٱصْبِرُوا صَبْرًا is valid on its own right as a use of the reinforcing absolute doee. But that is not exactly what the utterance صَبْرًا, by itself, signifies. Rather the governing verb ٱصْبِرُوا. is substituted with the absolute doee, such that the verb is no longer present in meaning, and the absolute doee is now its deputy, fulfilling its role.\n\nWhy then would one choose to use a absolute doee instead of a verb?20 The maṣdar signifies only a meaning of the action of the verb. The verb signifies both the meaning of its maṣdar and is also linked to a time in which the action originates, continues, or renews. So the verb is more temporary than its maṣdar. Therefore, if we use a absolute doee instead of a verb, then it is not explicitly linked to any time, nor does it explicitly imply a renewal of the action. So the absolute doee as a deputy for the verb signifies a constancy and inseperableness of the action. Whereas the verb is a direct application of the action.\nSecondly, the verb is necessarily tied to its doer. So, also in circumstances where the objective is the action itself, and not who does it, the absolute doee may be used as a deputy to the verb.\nHere are some more examples of a absolute doee as a deputy for the verb:\n\nقَالَ أَبُو لَهَبٍ تَبًّا لَكَ أَلِهَذَا جَمَعْتَنَا فَنَزَلَتْ تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ [صحيح البخاري :4973]\n“Abū Lahab said: ‘A perishing for you! Is it for this (that) you have gathered us?’ So there was revealed: ‘May the hands of Abū Lahab be ruined’” [سورة المسد 111:1]\n(تَبًّا is a absolute doee of the verb تَبَّ “to perish”.)\nشُكْرًا لَكُمْ\n“A thanking for you”\n(for أَشْكُرُكَ “I thank you.”)\nسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ “The glorification of Allāh!”\n(سُبْحَانَ is a entity noun→maṣdar for the verb سَبَّحَ “to glorify”.)\n\nIn the above example, the sentence with the verb could be, e.g., أُسَبِّحُ سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ “I glorify the glorification of Allāh.” But again, though this may be a valid sentence on its own right, it is not exactly what the utterance سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ, by itself, signifies. The entity noun→maṣdar سُبْحَان, as a deputy to the verb does not explicitly specify the verb or its doer. Rather, the entity noun→maṣdar سُبْحَان replaces its governing verb. The purpose is to mention the glorification of Allāh without being limited by a time limit for the action of the verb, or a need to mention the doer of the verb.21\nSimilarly,\n\nمَعَاذَ ٱللَّـٰهِ\n“The refuge of Allāh”\n(مَعَاذ is a maṣdar of عَاذَ يَعُوذُ “to seek refuge”.)\n\n\nUsing the u-state maṣdar instead of the absolute doee\nIn situations that call for a course of action, the u-state maṣdar may optionally be used instead of using the (a-state) absolute doee.\nFor example, in a situation that calls for patience, one might say\n\nصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ [معاني النحو 2/206]\n“A beautiful patience”\n\ninstead of saying صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا. Here, the implied meaning is ٱلْأَمْرُ فِيهِ صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ “The thing to be done in the matter is a beautiful patience.”22\nThe u-state maṣdar (instead of the a-state absolute doee) has the force of more constancy and generality. Additionally, it can imply that the action called for has, in the speaker’s estimation, already begun and become established. Here are some more examples:\n\nرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّـٰهِ عَلَيْهِ [معاني النحو 2/206]\n“The mercy of Allāh on him”\nوَيْحٌ لِزَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\n“A mercy on Zayd”\n\nIn the above example, the following alternative (using the absolute doee) is also possible:\n\n\nوَيْحًا لِزَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\nوَيْحَ زَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\n“A mercy on Zayd”\n(as though one were to say: أَلْزَمَهُ ٱللَّـٰهُ وَيْحًا “May Allāh may mercy to attend him constantly!”)\n\n\nThe words وَيْل, وَيْب, and وَيْس are used in a similar manner to وَيْح above. These are all maṣdars of disused verbs. وَيْح and وَيْس typically signify compassion and a mild chiding. Whereas وَيْل and وَيْب typically signify a severe chiding, calling for misfortune and destruction.\n\n\n\n34.6.2 The absolute doee as a deputy of a verb that is a info\nThere is a set of circumstances where the governing verb can deleted, and its place is taken by the absolute doee as its deputy. This is when the verb is the info of a nounal sentence, and the verb’s maṣdar wouldn’t ordinarily be a info in the u-state for the subject.23\nHere are some examples that should illustrate what we mean:\nConsider the sentence أَنْتَ تَأْكُلُ وَتَشْرَبُ “You are eating and drinking.” The verbs in this sentence may be deleted and each is substituted with its a-state absolute doees as a deputy. So we can say:\n\nأَنْتَ أَكْلًا وَشُرْبًا [معاني النحو 2/208]\n“You are eating and drinking.”\n(for أَنْتَ تَأْكُلُ وَتَشْرَبُ)\n\nWhat allows this is that the maṣdars أَكْل شُرْب wouldn’t oridinarily work as u-state infos for this subject. That is, we can’t say \\(\\times\\) أَنْتَ أَكْلٌ وَشُرْبٌ. So when we use the maṣdars in the a-state as absolute doees (أَنْتَ أَكْلًا وَشُرْبًا), it is understood that they are acting as a deputy for their respected deleted verbs.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nٱلْمَطَرُ سَحًّا سَحًّا [النحو الوافي 2/225]\n“The rain (is) pouring (and) pouring.”\n(سَحّ is the maṣdar of the verb سَحَّ يَسُحُّ “to pour down abundantly (of rain)”)\n\n\n\nمَا ٱلْأَسَدُ مَعَ فَرِيسَتِهِ إِلَّا فَتْكًا [النحو الوافي 2/226]\n“The lion is not, with his prey, [anything] but slaying”\n(فَتْك is the maṣdar of فَتَكَ يَفْتُكُ “to assault and slay”)\nأَسَفَاهَةً وَأَنْتَ مُثَقَّفٌ؟ [النحو الوافي 2/222]\n“[Do you act] foolishly while you are an educated [person]?”\n(سَفَاهَة is the maṣdar of سَفِهَ يَسْفَهُ “to be foolish”)\n\nAs you can see from the examples above, these circumstances are usually limited to one of the following kind of sentences:\n\na repeated maṣdar\nmultiple maṣdars joined with conjunctive particles\na restricted maṣdar\na maṣdar that is asked about in a question\n\n\n\n34.6.3 The absolute doee as a deputy for a verb in detailing a vague consequential action\nThis is a very specific circumstance where the absolute doee may occur as a deputy to a verb. Consider an action that is done as a consequence of some matter. If this consequential action is expressed only vaguely, then the following sentence can add detail to this vague action using absolute doees.24 Here is an example:\n\nإِنْ أَسَاءَ إِلَيْكَ ٱلصَّدِيقُ فَٱسْلُكْ مَسْلَكَ ٱلْعُقَلَاءِ. فَإٍمَّا عِتَابًا كَرِيمًا وَإِمَّا صَفْحًا جَمِيلًا [النحو الوافي 2/224]\nIf a friend does you wrong then take the path of the intelligent: So either an honorable reproving or a gracious pardoning”\n\nIn the example above, the consequential vague action is فَٱسْلُكْ مَسْلَكَ ٱلْعُقَلَاءِ “take the path of the intelligent”. The maṣdars عِتَاب “reproving” and صَفْح “pardoning” are then used as absolute doees to detail this vague action, فَإٍمَّا عِتَابًا كَرِيمًا وَإِمَّا صَفْحًا جَمِيلًا “So either an honorable reproving or a gracious pardoning.”25\n\n\n34.6.4 The absolute doee as a deputy for a verb in emphasizing the meaning of an entire sentence\nOne usage of the absolute doee as a deputy for a verb is in emphasizing the meaning of an entire sentence. The absolute doee in such cases are maṣdars (or entity noun→maṣdars) like:\n\nحَقًّا “truly” for أُحِقُّ حَقًّا “I assert a truth”\nيَقِينًا “certainly” for أُوقِنُ يَقِينًا “I ascertain a certainty”\n\nFor example,\n\nتَبَدَّى لَهُ جِبْرِيلُ فَقَالَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ إِنَّكَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ حَقًّا [صحيح البخاري :6982]\n“Gabriel would appear before him and say, ‘O Muḥammad! Indeed you are Allāh’s Messenger ﷺ truly’”\nوَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا [سورة النساء 4:157]\n“And they did not kill him, for certain.”\n\n\n\n34.6.5 The dualized absolute doee as a deputy of the verb\nThere are some absolute doees that are dualized and annexed to a pronoun in set phrases. The dual indicates a recurringness of the action. These include:\n\nلَبَّيْكَ – لَبّ is the entity noun→maṣdar of the verb أَلَبّ يُلِبُّ “to remain.” The a-state dualized maṣdar annexed to the addressee pronoun, لَبَّيْكَ, signifies “I remain for you (i.e. at your service] time after time.” A verb لَبَّىٰ يُلَبِّي تَلْبِيَةً “to utter لَبَّيْكَ” is derived from this phrase.\nسَعْدَيْكَ – سَعْد is the entity noun→maṣdar of the verb أَسْعَدَ يُسْعِدُ “to help” The a-state dualized maṣdar annexed to the addressee pronoun, سَعْدَيْكَ, signifies “I am at your aid time after time.”\nحَنَانَيْكَ – from حَنَان “mercy”. حَنَانَيْكَ signifies “Let your mercy be continuous to me.”\nدَوَالَيْكَ – from دَوَال which is equivalent to مُدَاوَلَة and تَدَاوُل “taking by turns”. دَوَالَيْكَ signifies “Make (you) the action to be done by turns.”\nحَذَارَيْكَ – from حَذَار “Beware”. حَذَارَيْكَ signifies “Twice beware!”",

    "text": "34.7 Differentiating the absolute doee from the other a-state doees\nThe absolute doee is a kind of doee. Other kinds of doees include the direct doee, the adverb of time and the adverb of place, and the adverb of reason. Generally, all adverbs can be considered to be in the category of doees. All doees are governed by verbs and occur in the a-state.\nSometimes it is not easy to disambiguate the exact function of an a-state noun occurring as a doee. We have already seen some instances of this. For example, we mentioned that in example (21) ضَرَبْتُهُ كَثِيرًا, that the a-state doee كَثِيرًا could be analyzed as either a absolute doee or a adverb of time, depending on context.\nSimilarly, in example (34) وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النساء 4:36] “and associate nothing with Him”, شَيْـًٔا has been analyzed to support both a absolute doee meaning and a direct doee meaning.\nFor some verbs, their maṣdars are re-used as common nouns. For example:\n\nأَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا – أَكْل is re-used to mean “a food”\nصَادَ يَصِيدُ صَيْدًا – صَيْد is re-used to mean “a prey”\nقَالَ يَقُولُ قَوْلًا – قَوْل is re-used to mean “a saying” or “a speech”\nسَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا – سُؤَال is re-used to mean “a question”\n\nWhen these nouns are in the a-state governed by their verb, then how do we tell whether they are a absolute doee or a direct doee? For example:\n\nأَكَلَ زَيْدٌ أَكْلًا\n“Zayd ate an eating.”\nor\n“Zayd ate a food.”\n\nBy itself, أَكْلًا supports both functions of the direct doee and the absolute doee. And we have to look at context to see which of the two meanings the speaker intended.\nSometimes, if the a-state doee is qualified, then that can help us distinguish between the two functions. For example,\n\nأَكَلَ زَيْدٌ أَكْلًا سَرِيعًا\n“Zayd ate a fast eating”\n(i.e. “Zayd ate quickly.”)\n\n\nIn the above example, the attribute سَرِيع “fast” is applied to the attributee أَكْلًا. Now, unless Zayd was eating “fast food” (unlikely in classical times), the attribute applies to the manner in which Zayd was eating. Hence أَكْلًا is a absolute doee and not a direct doee.\nSometimes, the qualifier may be applicable to both the absolute doee and the doee. Yet each meaning will be distinct. For example,\n\nصَادَ زَيْدٌ صَيْدَ ٱلْأَسَدِ\n“Zayd hunted (in the manner of) the hunting of a lion.”\nor\n“Zayd hunted the lion’s prey.”\n\nIn the above example, the doee صَيْد is qualified in an annexation with the base noun ٱلْأَسَد “the lion”. But the qualifier is applicable to both meanings of صَيْد: the absolute doee meaning: “hunting”, and the direct doee meaning: “prey”. When applied to the absolute doee meaning then the sentence means that Zayd hunted in a ferocious and daring manner, like a lion does. And when applied to the direct doee meaning then the sentence means that Zayd hunted a prey which was (previously) the prey of a lion. However, both of these meanings are distinct from each other. In this sort of case, context should help in figuring out the intended meaning.\nIn the case of maṣdars like أَكْل and صَيْد, when they are re-used as common nouns, then their existence is not tied to the action of the verb. For example, أَكْل, meaning “food”, exists prior to the action of eating. And صَيْد, meaning “prey” exists prior to the action of hunting.\nBut in the case of maṣdars like قَوْل and سُؤَال, even when they are a direct doee, they only come into existence with the action of their verb. So there is no قَوْل, either as a absolute doee or as a direct doee, before the action of “saying” And there is no سُؤَال, either as a absolute doee or as a direct doee, before the action of “asking”.\nIn such cases, even when a qualifier is applied, the line between the absolute doee and the direct doee can remain blurry. And that is not really a big deal because both meanings will be similar. For example,\n\nسَأَلَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا سُؤَالًا صَعْبًا\n“He asked a difficult questioning.”\n(i.e. the questioning was difficult upon Ɛamr)\nor\n“He asked a difficult question.”\n\nThis sort of ambiguity can sometimes be found in the other adverb doees as well.",

For example:\n\nأَعْجَبَنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ مُسْرِعًا [Wright 2/119C]\n“Zayd’s standing speedily pleased me.”\n(The governor is the annexe noun قِيَام which is a maṣdar)\nإِلَى ٱللَّـٰهِ مَرْجِعُكمْ جَمِيعًا [سورة المائدة 5:105]\n“To Allāh is your return all together”\n(The governor is the annexe noun مَرْجِع which is a maṣdar)\nأَنْتَ شَارِبُ ٱلْمَاءِ صَافِيًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/50]\n“You are drinking the water clear.” (The governor is the annexe noun شَارِب which is a doer participle)\n\nWhen the annexe noun is a real part of the base noun. For example:\n\nوَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا [سورة الحجر 15:47]\n“And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, [so they will be] brothers”\n(The annexe noun صُدُور is a real part of the base noun person of ḥāl هِمْ.)\nأَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا [سورة الحجرات 49:12]\n“Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead?”\n(The annexe noun لَحْم is a real part of the base noun person of ḥāl أَخ.)\n\nWhen the annexe noun is not really but is virtually a part of the base noun. Such that the meaning would still be correct if the annexe noun was removed. For example:\n\nثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ ٱتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا [سورة النحل 16:123]\n“Then We revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth”\n(حَنِيفًا is a ḥāl of the person of ḥāl إِبْرَاهِيم. مِلَّة is virtually a part of إِبْرَاهِيم such that the meaning is correct without it: ٱتَّبِعْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا.)\n\n\nWhen none of these conditions are satisfied then the base noun cannot be a person of ḥāl. So we cannot say:\n\n✗ مَرَرْتُ بِغُلَامِ هِنْدٍ جَالِسَةً [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/51]\n“I passed by Hind’s slave boy (when she was) sitting.”\n\n\n\nDetermining the person of ḥāl when there is more than one possibility\nWhen the sentence has more than one noun as a possible person of ḥāl, usually the meaning, gender, or number is sufficient to determine whom the ḥāl is describing. But sometimes context will be needed to determine who the person of ḥāl is. For example:\n\n\nقَابَلْتُ ٱلْأَخَ رَاكِبًا [النحو الوافي 2/386A]\n“I met the brother riding”\n\nIn the example above, the ḥāl رَاكِبًا may be applicable to either the speaker (assuming he is male), or to ٱلْأَخ “the brother”. Context should tell us which is intended. If context is not sufficient then is more suitable for the closer of the two to the ḥāl to be the person of ḥāl. Or, to avoid ambiguity, it may be better that the expression not be used in this case.1",

    "text": "35.6 Multiple ḥāls or persons of ḥāl\nThere may be one or multiple ḥāls that correspond to one or multiple persons of ḥāl. This occurs in the following cases:\n\n35.6.1 Multiple ḥāls for one person of ḥāl\nThese are examples of multiple ḥāls corresponding to one person of ḥāl:\n\nوَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسى إِلى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبانَ أَسِفًا [سورة الأعراف 7:150]\n“And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved”\nارْجِعِي إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَرْضِيَّةً [سورة الفجر 89:28]\n“Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]”\nمَا لَكِ يَا عَائِشُ حَشْيَا رَابِيَةً [صحيح مسلم :974b]\n“Why are you, O Ɛāʾis͡hah, panting and short of breath?”\n(حَشْيَا, on the pattern فَعْلَىٰ, is the feminine of حَشْيَان meaning “short of breath”. رَابِيَة has a similar meaning.)\n\nAs you can see, there is no need for a conjunction like و to connect the multiple ḥāls (though we may use the word “and” in the translation). If such a و is inserted, then the noun(s) following it is technically no longer a ḥāl. Rather, it is now a post-conjunction to the preceding ḥāl.5 For example:\n\nأَقْبَلَ ٱلْمُنْتَصِرُ فَرِحًا وَمُسْرِعًا وَمُصَافِحًا رِفَاقَهُ [النحو الوافي 2/430]\n“The victor approached rejoicing, hastening, and shaking hands with his companions.”\n\nIn the above example, فَرِحًا is a ḥāl, مُسْرِعًا and مُصَافِحًا are post-conjunctions.\nThis distinction is technically correct. However, loosely speaking, words like مُسْرِعًا and مُصَافِحًا in the example above may be referred to as ḥāls.6\nSee also section (ref) later in this chapter for multiple ḥāls when one or more is a sentence ḥāl.\n\n\n35.6.2 One ḥāl for multiple persons of ḥāl\nIf there are multiple persons of ḥāl and the same ḥāl can be used to describe all of them, then one ḥāl, appropriately dualized or pluralized, may be used. We have already seen an example of this in example (4) earlier in this chapter:\n\nجَاءَ سَعِيدٌ وَخَالِدٌ رَاكِبَيْنِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/38]\n“Saɛīd and K͡hālid came riding.”\n\nHere is another example:\n\nوَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَائِبَيْنِ [سورة إبراهيم 14:33]\n“And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit]”\n\nSometimes the multiple persons of ḥāl may even occur in different functions in the sentence. For example:\n\nقَابَلَ عَلِيٌّ صَدِيقَهُ مَسْرُورَيْنِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/28]\n“Ɛaliyy met his friend (while they both were) happy.”\nلَقِيتُهُ رَاكِبَيْنِ [Wright 2/113B]\n“I met him (while we both were) riding”\n\n\n\n35.6.3 Multiple ḥāls for multiple persons of ḥāl\nIf there are multiple persons of ḥāl, and each is to be described by different ḥāls, then the individual ḥāls may occur in the sentence without any conjunction. If context and meaning are not sufficient to determine which ḥāl applies to which person of ḥāl, then the first ḥāl (in sentence word order) should apply to the second person of ḥāl, and the second ḥāl should apply to the first person of ḥāl.7 For example:\n\nلَقِيتُ خَالِدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/39]\n“I met K͡hālid (while he was) going up (and Im was) coming down.”\n\nBut if meaning and context are sufficient to disambiguate, then the ḥāls may occur in either order. For example:\n\nلَقِيتُ هِنْدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرَةً [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/39]\n“I met Hind (while Im was) going up (and she was) coming down.”",

For example:\n\nجَاءَ ٱلضَّيْفَ وَحْدَهُ [النحو الوافي 2/375]\n“The guest came by himself.”\n\nOther definite nouns may also occur as ḥāls.

    "text": "35.9 The order of the ḥāl, the person of ḥāl and the governor\nThe normal order is: first the governor, then the person of ḥāl, then the ḥāl. However, there is much variability permitted, subject to certain rules.\n\n35.9.1 The ḥāl preceding the governor\nThe ḥāl may precede the governor if the governor is an verb or quasi-verb that flexes based on the doer.\nSo we can say:\n\nرَاكِبًا جَاءَ زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/118B]\n“Zayd came riding.”\nمُسْرِعًا ذَا رَاحِلٌ [Wright 2/118B and النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/53]\n“In haste is this this (man) departing.”\n(ذَا is a pointing noun like هَـٰذَا. See section (ref).)\nمُخْلِصًا زَيْدٌ دَعَا [add ref to alfiyyah ibn malik]\n“Sincerely did Zayd supplicate.”\n(The ḥāl مُخْلِصًا precedes not just its governor in the info دَعَا, but also the subject زَيْدٌ.)\n\nIf the governor is a verb or adjectival noun that is rigid (does not flex based on the doer), then the ḥāl rarely9, if ever10, precedes the governor. Examples of such governors are the verb of wonder and the comparative noun. For example:\n\nمَا أَحْسَنَ زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا [Wright 2/118B]\n(not ✗ ضَاحِكًا مَا أَحْسَنَ زَيْدٌ)\n“How handsome is Zayd (when) laughing!”\nزَيْدٌ أَحْسَنُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو ضَاحِكًا [Wright 2/118B]\n(not ✗ زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو)\n“Zayd is more handsome than Ɛamr (when) laughing.”\n\nAn exception is permitted when a noun, in one ḥāl, is compared with itself or another noun in another ḥāl. In this case, the ḥāl regularly precedes its comparative noun governor. For example:\n\nزَيْدٌ قَائِمًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ قَاعِدًا [Wright 2/118C]\n“Zayd when standing is more handsome than [himself] when sitting.”\nزَيْدٌ مُفْرَدًا أَنْفَعُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو مُعَانًا [Wright 2/118C]\n“Zayd when alone is more useful than Ɛamr when assisted (by others).”\n\nIf the governor is not a verb or a quasi-verb but an expression that has verbal force, then the ḥāl usually does not precede the governor.11\n\nكَأَنَّ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا أَسَدٌ [Wright 2/118D]\n(not ✗ رَاكِبًا كَأَنَّ زَيْدٌ أَسَدٌ)\n“[It is] as if Zayd, when riding, is a lion.”\nزَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ قَائِمًا [Wright 2/118D]\n(not ✗ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا فِي ٱلدَّارِ)\n“Zayd is in the house standing.”\nتِلْكَ هِنْدٌ بَاحِثَةً [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/53]\n(not ✗ بَاحِثَةً تِلْكَ هِنْدٌ)\n“That is Hind, searching.”\n\n\n\n35.9.2 The ḥāl preceding the person of ḥāl\nThe ḥāl is generally allowed to precede the person of ḥāl when the person of ḥāl is in the u-state or a-state. For example:\n\nجَاءَ ضَاحِكًا زَيْدٌ [Wright 2/119A]\n“Zayd came riding.”\nشَرِبْتُ ٱلْمَاءَ صَافِيًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/48]\n“I drank the water clear.”\n\nExcepted from this general permissibility is if the person of ḥāl is restricted by إِلَّا. For example:\n\nمَا جَاءَ أُسَامَةُ إِلَّا رَاكِبًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/48]\n“Usāmah did not come except riding.”\nوَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ [سورة الأنعام 6:48]\n“And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners.”\n\nWhen the person of ḥāl is in the i-state then: if it is a base noun in an annexation, then the ḥāl should follow the person of ḥāl and not precede it.\nFor example:\n\nأَعْجَبَنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ مُسْرِعًا [Wright 2/119C]\n“Zayd’s standing speedily pleased me.”\n\nIf the person of ḥāl is in the i-state due to a preceding preposition, then the ḥāl will usually follow it and not precede it. For example:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِهِنْدٍ جَالِسَةً [Wright 2/119B]\n“I passed by Hind (when she was) sitting.”\n\nOccasionally, however, the ḥāl has been found to precede the i-state person of ḥāl preceded by a preposition. For example:\n\nوَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا كَافَّةً لِلنَّاسِ [سورة سبأ 34:28]\n“And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind”\n\n\n\n35.9.3 Reasons for varying the normal order\nThe natural order, as we have mentioned, is: first the governor, then the person of ḥāl, then the ḥāl. So normally we would say:\n\nحَضَرَ مُحَمَّدٌ مَاشِيًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/55]\n“Muḥammad came walking.”\n\nThe speaker may choose to vary this normal order for a variety of reasons. For example, if Muḥammad had been previously hampered from walking due to an illness or injury, then in order to emphasize his being able to walk, the speaker may say:\n\nحَضَرَ مَاشِيًا مُحَمَّدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/55]\n\nOr if the listener was incorrectly assuming that Muḥammad came riding and not walking, then the speaker may wish to disabuse him by saying\n\nمَاشِيًا حَضَرَ مُحَمَّدٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/55]\n\nThere may be other reasons as well.12",

    "text": "35.10 Transitory and permanent meanings for the ḥāl\nFundamentally, the ḥāl is transitory in its meaning; i.e. it is not meant to be a permanent description of the person of ḥāl. For example:\n\nجَاءَ سَعِيدٌ غَاضِبًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/28]\n“Saɛīd came angry”\nأَقْبَلَ خَالِدٌ رَاكِبًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/28]\n“K͡hālid came riding.”\n\nIn the above examples, the ḥāls غَاضِبًا “angry” and رَاكِبًا “riding” are meant to be transitory descriptions, such that it is conceivable that Saɛīd may cease to be angry, and that K͡hālid could come walking instead of riding.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the ḥāl have a more permanent meaning. This is primarily when the ḥāl describes person of ḥāl as it comes in to existence or relevance.\nFor example:\n\nوَخُلِقَ ٱلْإِنْسَانُ ضَعِيفًا [سورة النساء 4:28]\n“and mankind was created weak”\nقَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَىٰ [سورة آل عمران 3:36]\n“she said, ‘My Lord, I have delivered a female.’”\nوَلَدَتْهُ أَزْرَقَ ٱلْعَيْنَينِ أَفْطَسَ ٱلْأَنْفِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/29]\n“She gave birth to him blue-eyed (and) snub-nosed”\n\nThe ḥāl may also have a more permanent meaning in the sense that while it describes the person of ḥāl linked in time to the governor, its meaning also applies more permanently to the person of ḥāl. For example:\n\nوَهَـٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيمًا [سورة الأنعام 6:126 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/30]\n“And this is the path of your Lord, [leading] straight”\n(The ḥāl مُسْتَقِيمًا “straight” applies permanently to the person of ḥāl صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ “path of your Lord”)",

    "text": "35.11 Difference in meaning between the ḥāl and the attribute\nThe ḥāl and the the attribute are typically both sourced from adjectival nouns. And generally when you use the adjectival noun as a ḥāl it will have a different meaning from when it is used as a adjectival noun.\nConsider the following two examples:\n\nهَـٰذَا ٱلْفَرَسُ ٱلسَّابِقُ [معاني النحو 2/334]\n“This is the foremost horse.”\nهَـٰذَا ٱلْفَرَسُ سَابِقًا [معاني النحو 2/334]\n“This is the horse (when it is) foremost”\n\nThe former sentence is describing the horse as being foremost, but not necessarily at the time when the speaker is pointing to it. So, at the moment of pointing to it, the horse may actually be tethered. Whereas the latter sentence is describing the horse at the moment of pointing at it. It would likely be running and and being foremost at that time.\nSimilarly, consider:\n\nأَقْبَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْمُقَصِّرُ [معاني النحو 2/333]\n“The slacking student approached.”\nأَقْبَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ مُقَصِّرًا [معاني النحو 2/333]\n“The student approached (while) slacking.”\n\nThe same distinction appiles to the above two examples. The former sentence describes the student as a slacker generally. But he may not be slacking at the moment when he is approaching. Whereas the latter sentence describes the student as slacking when he is approaching. He may not be a slacker in general.\n\nHowever, there can sometimes be some overlap in meaning.13 For example, in the scenario when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nthe ḥāl has a transitory meaning,\nthe meaning of the ḥāl is a description of motion or posture (like “sitting”, “standing”, “sleeping”, “running”, etc.),\nthe person of ḥāl is indefinite,\nthe governor is an expression that has verbal force (see section (ref)).\n\nIn such a case, the adjectival noun used as a attribute may have a somewhat similar meaning to it being used a ḥāl. For example: \n\nفِيهَا رَجُلٌ قَائِمٌ\n“In it (i.e. the house), is a standing man.”\n(attribute)\nفِيهَا رَجُلٌ قَائِمًا\n[سيبويه 1/272 cited by معاني النحو 2/352]\n“In the house, is a man standing.”\n(ḥāl)\n\nThere may also be a case where the ḥāl is indistinguishable from the attribute due to the person of ḥāl being indefinite and in the a-state. For example:\n\nرَأَيْتُ طَالِبًا مُقَصِّرًا [معاني النحو 2/352]\n“I saw a student slacking.”\nor\n“I saw a slacking student.”",

Most of the examples we have seen so far have been of the ḥāl as a deverbal noun. For example: رَاكِبًا, غَاضِبًا, etc. However, it is possible for the ḥāl to be primitive noun.

    "section": "35.13 A maṣdar as the ḥāl",
    "text": "35.13 A maṣdar as the ḥāl\n\nThe maṣdar can sometimes appear to be a ḥāl. For example:\n\nأَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ رَكْضًا [معاني النحو 2/345]\n“Ɛaliyy approached (in the state of) running.”\n\nIn the above example, the opinion of some scholars would be that the maṣdar رَكْضًا is a ḥāl. And this is a substitute for saying أَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ رَاكِضًا.\nWhen the maṣdar is used thus it remains in the indefinite singular regardless of the number of the persons of ḥāl. For example:\n\nأَقْبَلَ ٱلْقَوْمُ رَكْضًا\n“The people approached running.”\n\nThe reasons for using a maṣdar رَكْضًا in this way instead of the adjectival noun رَاكِضًا may be:\n\nEmphasis. The maṣdar signifies purely the meaning of the verb “to run”. Whereas the adjectival noun signifies the meaning of the verb along with person described by the adjectival noun (the runner). So using the maṣdar as a ḥāl draws attention to the meaning of running rather than the person who is running. The maṣdar used in this way can also be seen as a sort of metaphor, as if Ɛaliyy, while executing the action of running, became the act of running.14\nExpanding the sense of the adverb to incorporate other adverbs. The maṣdar رَكْضًا, in the above example, can also be analyzed as an absolute doee (being a deputy to the maṣdar إِقْبَال) meaning:\n\nأَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ إِقْبَالَ رَكْضٍ [معاني النحو 2/348]\n“Ɛaliyy approached (in) the type of approaching (that is) running.”\n\nThe use of the maṣdar in this way could then be used to intend both the ḥāl meaning and the absolute doee meaning together. That is Ɛaliyy’s type and state of approaching was running.\nDepending on the meaning of the maṣdar, other types of adverbs, like the adverb of reason, may be included in this expanded sense as well.15\n\nSome scholars are conservative in analyzing a maṣdar as a ḥāl, and instead prefer that it be analyzed as another adverb, like a (deputy) absolute doee or an adverb of reason, etc.16 And if the meaning of the maṣdar does not allow it to be analyzed as another adverb, and only as a ḥāl then it is accepted as a permitted usage but one that is restricted to what has been recorded from Classical Arabic.\nHere are some examples of maṣdars having being analyzed as ḥāl.

    "section": "35.14 A sentence as the ḥāl",
    "text": "35.14 A sentence as the ḥāl\nIn the examples so far, the ḥāl has always been a single word, usually an adjectival noun. For example, جَاءَ زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا “Zayd came laughing”. Instead, of using the adjectival noun ضَاحِكًا, we can instead use the u-state stateful verb يَضْحَكُ:\n\nجَاءَ زَيْدٌ يَضْحَكُ [Wright, 2/331C]\n“Zayd came laughing.”\n\nActually, يَضْحَكُ is not just a verb. Rather, it is a complete sentence comprising of the verb itself and the doer which, in this case, is the hidden pronoun “he”. So the ḥāl here is a sentence.\nAs we know, the ḥāl describes the person of ḥāl during time of ḥāl’s governing verb. The use of the stateful verb يَضْحَكُ signifies that Zayd’s action of laughing was ongoing during the time of the governor جَاءَ. So يَضْحَكُ has a past meaning because of the perfect verb جَاءَ. An additional verb like كَانَ is not needed to transport the verb يَضْحَكُ to the past. Similarly, if the governor was in the present or the future, the stateful verb in the ḥāl would automatically be transported to the present or future as well. For example:\n\nسَيَأْتِي زَيْدٌ يَضْحَكُ\n“Zayd will come laughing.”\n\nIn fact, it is not permitted for the ḥāl sentence that begins with the stateful verb to itself be prefixed with سَ or سَوْفَ.21 So we cannot say (intending سَيَضْحَكُ to be a ḥāl):\n\n✗ سَيَأْتِي زَيْدٌ سَيَضْحَكُ or\n✗ يَأْتِي زَيْدٌ سَيَضْحَكُ\n\nThis restriction only applies to stateful verbs that begin a sentence ḥāl. If a stateful verb begins a sentence that is not a ḥāl then it may begin with سَ or سَوْفَ. For example:\n\nوَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ [سورة الصافات 37:99]\n“And [then] he said, ’Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me.”\n\nHere are some more examples of sentence ḥāls comprised of a stateful verb and a doer (or deputy doer) pronoun:\n\nوَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ [سورة يوسف 12:16]\n“And they came to their father at night, weeping.”\n\n\n35.14.1 The link between the sentence ḥāl and the person of ḥāl\nThe sentence comprising of only the stateful verb and its doer is the simplest, and one of the most common, kind of ḥāl sentence. However, more complex ḥāl sentences are also possible. And the person of ḥāl need not always be the doer of the verb in the sentence.\nBut the sentence ḥāl needs to have a link between it and the person of ḥāl. This link is often a pronoun that refers back to the person of ḥāl. In the examples above this link pronoun was the doer pronoun of the stateful verb. Here is an example of a more complex ḥāl sentence:\n\nجَاءَ زَيْدٌ يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ [Wright, 2/331A]\n“Zayd came (with) his hand on his head.”\n\nIn the example above, the sentence يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ is the ḥāl. Note that يَد is in the u-state because it is the subject of the sentence. It is not in the a-state because it is not, by itself, the ḥāl. The entire sentence يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ is considered to be in the a-state as the ḥāl. The link is the pronoun ه in يَدُهُ and رَأْسِهِ.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nٱهْبِطُوا۟ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٍّ [سورة البقرة 2:36]\n“Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another”\n(The sentence بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٍّ is the ḥāl. The link is the pronoun كُمْ in بَعْضُكُمْ.)",

    "section": "35.15 The و of ḥāl and its rules",
    "text": "35.15 The و of ḥāl and its rules\nInstead of, or in addition to, a pronoun as the link between the sentence ḥāl and the person of ḥāl, a special و, called the و of ḥāl, may be used. The و of ḥāl signifies that the sentence ḥāl occurred while the governing verb took place. Here are some examples of the the و of ḥāl:\n\nقَامَ زَيْدٌ وَهَوَ بَاكٍ [Wright 2/330C]\n“Zayd stood up while he was crying.”\nأَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَرَّ بِسَعْدٍ وَهُوَ يَتَوَضَّأُ [سنن ابن ماجه :425]\n“that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ passed by Saɛd while he was performing ablution”\n\nWe have defined the ḥāl as an adverb that describes the person of ḥāl. However, sometimes, the ḥāl sentence that is linked with a و of ḥāl won’t apparently describe the person of ḥāl. In fact, it may not even refer to the person of ḥāl at all. For example:\n\nذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو يَشْتَغِلُ [Wright 2/331A]\n“Zayd went while Ɛamr was busy.”\n\nIn the example above, the ḥāl’s description of the person of ḥāl is only circumstantial, in that it alludes to the time in which the action of the governing verb occurred. In such cases the meaning of the ḥāl approaches that of the adverb of time. This is another of the cases where the lines between different types of adverbs get blurred. We have seen similar cases in sections (ref). Here are some more examples:\n\nDepending on the sentence, the و of ḥāl can be either mandatory, optional, or disallowed.\nLet’s go over the different types of ḥāl sentences, and discuss the ruling of the و of ḥāl in each type of sentence.\n\n\n35.15.1 The ḥāl sentence is a nounal sentence\nWhen the ḥāl sentence is a nounal sentence, then there are three possibilities:\n\nThe ḥāl sentence is devoid of a pronoun referring back to the person of ḥāl. In this case, the و of ḥāl is obligatory. For example:\n\nمَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٌو فِي ٱلدَّارِ [المقتضب للمبرد 4/125 cited by وجوب الربط بالواو لعبد الجبار فتحي زيدان]\n“I passed by Zayd while Ɛamr (was) in the house.”\n\nIn the above example the person of ḥāl is زَيْد and the ḥāl is the nounal sentence عَمْرٌو فِي ٱلدَّارِ. The sentence ḥāl does not have a pronoun that refers back to the person of ḥāl. Therefore the و of ḥāl is necessary to link the sentence ḥāl to the person of ḥāl.\nWe have also already seen this usage in example (123) ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو يَشْتَغِلُ. Here are more examples:\n\nكَمَا أَخْرَجَكَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ بَيْتِكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقًا مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ لَكَارِهُونَ [سورة الأنفال 8:5 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/58]\n“[It is] just as when your Lord brought you out of your home [for the battle of Badr] in truth, while indeed, a party among the believers were unwilling,”\nقَالُوا لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ [سورة يوسف 12:14 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/58]\n“They said, ’If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan,”\n\nThe sentence ḥāl begins with a pronoun that refers to person of ḥāl. In this case as well, the و of ḥāl is obligatory. The link between the sentence ḥāl and the person of ḥāl is now both the pronoun and the و of ḥāl. We saw this usage in examples (121) قَامَ زَيْدٌ وَهَوَ بَاكٍ and (122) أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَرَّ بِسَعْدٍ وَهُوَ يَتَوَضَّأُ.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nلَا تَقْرَبُوا ٱلصَّلَاةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَارَىٰ [سورة النساء 4:43 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/58]\n“do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated”\nكَذَبْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ [Wright 2/330D]\n“You lied, knowing (that you did so).”\nوَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا وَهُمْ كُسَالَى [سورة التوبة 9:54]\n“and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy”\n\nSome grammarians admitted optionally dropping the و of ḥāl in this case to allow sentences like:\n\nجَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ هُوَ فَارِسٌ [معاني القرآن وإعرابه للزجاج 2/317 cited by وجوب الربط بالواو لعبد الجبار فتحي زيدان]\n“Zayd came to me while he (was) on horseback.”\n(instead of the more normal usage with the و of ḥāl: جَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ وَهُوَ فَارِسٌ)\n\nBut this opinion is considered anomalous by the majority of the grammarians.22\nThe ḥāl sentence has a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl but it does not begin the ḥāl sentence. In this case, the و of ḥāl is optional. But generally, it will be preferred to have the و of ḥāl. For example:\n\nجَاءَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَيَدُهُ فِي جَيْبِهِ. [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/61] (more preferred)\nجَاءَ مُحَمَّدٌ يَدُهُ فِي جَيْبِهِ. [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/61] (less preferred)\nMuḥammad came (with) his hand in his pocket.”\n\nIf the ḥāl sentence’s info is a quasi-sentence (consisting of an prepositional or adverbial phrase), and the info precedes the subject, then dropping the و of ḥāl is normal.23 For example:\n\nجَاء زَيْدٌ فِي يَدِهِ سَوْطٌ\n“Zayd came (with) a whip in his hand.”\n(The ḥāl sentence is فِي يَدِهِ سَوْطٌ. Its info فِي يَدِهِ precedes its subject سَوْطٌ.)\n\n\n\n\n35.15.2 The ḥāl sentence is a verbal sentence that begins with a perfect verb\nThere are several possible cases here:\n\nThe ḥāl sentence is devoid of a pronoun that refers back to the person of ḥāl. In this case the و of ḥāl is mandatory. Furthermore, if the ḥāl sentence is affirmative, the perfect verb shall be preceded by the particle قَدْ. And if the ḥāl sentence is negative, the perfect verb shall not be preceded by the particle قَدْ. Examples:\n\nجِئْتُ وَقَدْ طَلَعَتِ ٱلشَّمْسُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/58]\n“I came while the sun had already risen.”\nجِئْتُ وَمَا طَلَعَتِ ٱلشَّمْسُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/58]\n“I came while the sun had not risen.”\n\nThe ḥāl sentence has a pronoun that refers back to the person of ḥāl. In this case the و of ḥāl is optional. Furthermore, if the ḥāl sentence is affirmative, the perfect verb can optionally be preceded by the particle قَدْ. And if the ḥāl sentence is negative, the perfect verb shall not be preceded by the particle قَدْ. Here are some examples:\nAffirmative with و of ḥāl and with قَدْ. (This is the most common case.):\n\nوَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَائِنَا [سورة البقرة 2:246 cited by Wright 2/332B]\n“And why should we not fight in the cause of Allāh when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?”\n\nAffirmative with و of ḥāl and without قَدْ:\n\nقَالُوا۟ أَنُؤْمِنُ لَكَ وَٱتَّبَعَكَ ٱلْأَرْذَلُونَ [سورة الشعراء 26:111 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/62]\n“They said, ‘Should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?’”\n\nAffirmative without و of ḥāl and without قَدْ:\n\nأَوْ جَاءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَنْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ [سورة النساء 4:90 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/62 and Wright 2/332B]\n“or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you”\n\nAffirmative without و of ḥāl and with قَدْ:\n\nرَأَيْنَاهُ قَدْ تَغَيَّرَ لِزَيْدٍ وَكَانَ عَلَىٰ جُنْدِهِ [Wright 2/332C]\n“We saw him (when) he had changed [color due to being enraged] at Zayd who (was) [in command of] his army.”\n\nNegative with و of ḥāl (more common):\n\nجَاءَ زَيْدٌ وَمَا قَامَ أَبُوهُ [Wright 2/332D]\n“Zayd came without his father having stood up.”\n\nNegative without و of ḥāl (less common):\n\nجَاءَ زَيْدٌ مَا قَامَ أَبُوهُ [Wright 2/332D]\n“Zayd came without his father having stood up.”\n\nThe ḥāl sentence is an exception, preceded by إِلَّا. In this case the و of ḥāl is prohibited. For example:\n\nوَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ [سورة الحجر 15:11 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/61]\n“And no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him.”\n(The sentence كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ is the ḥāl beginning with a perfect verb.)\n\nSome grammarians allowed the و of ḥāl in this case, but the examples they cite are considered irregular to normal usage.24\nThe perfect verb is followed by the conjunction أَوْ. In this case, the perfect verb is used with a conditional meaning. For example:\n\nأَحْفَظُ زَوْجِي غَابَ أَوْ حَضَرَ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/61]\nلأضربنَّه ذهب أو مكث [حالات الربط بواو الحال الجبار فتحي زيدان and أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/289]\n“I will certainly beat him [whether] he went or stayed.”\n\n\n\n\n35.15.3 The ḥāl sentence is a verbal sentence that begins with a stateful verb\nWhen a sentence ḥāl begins with a stateful verb, then, if the stateful is used with a continuous meaning (i.e. not with لَمْ or لَمَّا), then the ḥāl sentence will contain a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl. If the stateful is used with a past meaning (i.e. with لَمْ or لَمَّا), then the ḥāl sentence may or may not have a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl.25\nThere are again a number of possible cases.\n\nThe sentence is affirmative and the stateful verb is preceded by the particle قَدْ. In this case, the و of ḥāl is obligatory. For example,\n\nلِمَ تُؤْذُونَنِى وَقَدْ تَعْلَمُونَ أَنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ [سورة الصف 61:5 cited by Wright 2/331C]\n“why do you harm me while you certainly know that I am the messenger of Allāh to you?”\n\nThe sentence is affirmative and the stateful verb is not preceded by the particle قَدْ. We assume here that the sentence ḥāl contains a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl.\nIn this case, the و of ḥāl is usually not used. We have already seen examples of this case earlier, like (114) جَاءَ زَيْدٌ يَضْحَكُ and (118) وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nجَاءَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ تُقَادُ ٱلْجَنَائِبُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ [Wright 2/331C]\n“The commander came with the horses led in front of him.”\n(جَنَائِب is the plural of جَنِيب which is a word for a tractable horse that is led.)\nوَجَاءَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَقْصَى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ [سورة القصص 28:20]\n“And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running.”\n\nWhat we have shown above constitutes the more common usage. However, we do sometimes see a ḥāl sentence beginning with a stateful verb with the و of ḥāl and without قَدْ. For example,\n\nقُمْتُ وَأَصُّكُ عَيْنَهُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/59 and حالات الربط بواو الحال الجبار فتحي زيدان]\n“I stood up, slapping his eye.”\n\nMore usually though, if a و of ḥāl is to be used with a stateful verb, then a pronoun referring to the doer is inserted before it, converting the ḥāl sentence to a nounal sentence, thus:\n\nقُمْتُ وَأَنَا أَصُّكُ عَيْنَهُ\n“I stood up, slapping his eye.”\n\nWe have already covered this type of ḥāl sentence in section (ref) above.\n\n\n\nThe sentence is negative and the stateful verb is negated with لَا or مَا. We again assume here that the sentence ḥāl contains a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl. In this case, the و of ḥāl is prohibited.\n\nوَمَا لَنَا لَا نُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ [سورة المائدة 5:84 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/59 and أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/289]\n“And why should we not believe in Allāh”\nعَهَدْتُكَ مَا تَصْبُو وَفِيكَ شَبِيبَةٌ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60 and أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/290]\n“I knew you when you were not childish while [you had] in you youth.”\n(مَا تَصْبُوا “You were not childish” is a sentence ḥāl)\n\nThe sentence is negative and the stateful verb is negated with لَمْ. Here, the sentence ḥāl need not contain a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl. In this case, the و of ḥāl is usually kept, although it is permissible to drop it. For example:\n\nأَوْ قَالَ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إِلَيْهِ شَىْءٌ [سورة الأنعام 6:93 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\n“or says, ‘It has been inspired to me,’ while nothing has been inspired to him”\nفَٱنْقَلَبُوا بِنِعْمَةٍ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوءٌ [سورة الأنعام 6:93 cited by النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\n“So they returned with favor from Allāh and bounty, no harm having touched them.”\nأَقْبَلَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَلَمْ يَحْمِلْ كُتُبَهُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\nأَقْبَلَ سَعِيدٌ لَمْ يَحْمِلْ كُتُبَهُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\n“Muḥammad/Saɛīd approached while he didn’t carry his books.”\n\nIf the sentence ḥāl does not have a pronoun that links to the person of ḥāl then the و of ḥāl is to be used. For example:\n\nأَقْبَلَ سَعِيدٌ وَلَمْ تَطْلُعِ ٱلشَّمْسُ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\n“Saɛīd approached while the sun had not risen.”\nوَلَقَدْ خَشِيتُ بِأَنْ أَمُوتَ وَلَمْ تَدُرْ لِلْحَرْبِ دَائِرَةٌ عَلَى ابْنَيْ ضَمْضَمِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 2/60]\n“And indeed I feared that I would die, while a turn [of misfortune] had not [yet] turned, in battle, on the two sons of Ḍamḍam”\n(وَلَمْ تَدُرْ لِلْحَرْبِ دَائِرَةٌ is the sentence ḥāl)\n\nThe sentence is negative and the stateful verb is negated with لَمَّا. Here again, the sentence ḥāl need not contain a pronoun that refers to the person of ḥāl. In this case, the و of ḥāl is typically chosen to be used.26 For example:\n\nأَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُوا ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَاهَدُوا مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ [سورة آل عمران 3:142]\n“Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allāh has not yet made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast?”\n\n\n\n\n35.15.4 The sentence ḥāl strengthens the meaning of the preceding sentence as a whole\nSometimes the ḥāl describes, not just a single word as the person of ḥāl but the preceding sentence as a whole. (See section (ref)). If the ḥāl is itself a sentence, then the و of ḥāl is not used.\nFor example:\n\nذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ [سورة البقرة 2:2 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/289 and حالات الربط بواو الحال الجبار فتحي زيدان]\n“This is the Book about which there is no doubt”\n(The sentence لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ, in this interpretation, is analyzed as a ḥāl to the preceding sentence ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ.)\n\n\n\n35.15.5 The sentence ḥāl is a post-conjunction\nIf a sentence ḥāl is preceded by a conjunction (see section (multiple hals) above), then an additional و of ḥāl is not typically tacked on to the conjunction.\nFor example:\n\nفَجَاءَهَا بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتًا أَوْ هُمْ قَائِلُونَ [سورة الأعراف 7:4]\n“and Our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon.”\n(An additional و of ḥāl is not tacked on to the conjunction أَوْ.)\n\nHowever, according to some grammarians, a و of ḥāl, can be added to the conjunction and it would be acceptable.27 For example:\n\nأَتَيْتَنِى وَالِيًا أَوْ وَأَنَا مَعْزُولٌ [معاني القرآن للفراء for سورة الأعراف 7:4]\n“You came to me, while I was adjacent, or while I was remote.”",

    "text": "35.16 Purposes of the و of ḥāl\nThe و of ḥāl essentially distances the ḥāl from the influence of the governing verb.28 For example, consider the expression:\n\nجَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ يُسْرِعُ [دلائل الإعجاز للجرجاني 1/213]\n“Zayd came to me hastening.”\n\nThe above example is almost equivalent to saying جَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ مُسْرِعًا. The ḥāl يُسْرِعُ is tightly bound to the governor جَاءَ. So the expression asserts Zayd’s coming and his hastening as one assertion. \nConsider now the expression with the و of ḥāl:\n\nجَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ وَهُوَ يُسْرِعُ [دلائل الإعجاز للجرجاني 1/214]\n“Zayd came to me while he was hastening.”\n\nHere the ḥāl sentence وَهُوَ يُسْرِعُ is a more independent assertion. Now, the only link between the ḥāl and its governing verb is that the ḥāl expresses the state of the person of ḥāl when the action of the governing verb took place.\n\nThe و of ḥāl can be used for a different purposes. We will list them below. In the following discussion, there will be three distinct expressions that we will refer to:\n\nThe و of ḥāl\nThe ḥāl sentence which follows the و of ḥāl\nThe preceding statement which precedes the و of ḥāl\n\nHere are some purposes of the و of ḥāl:\n\nThe و of ḥāl indicates that the event in the preceding statement took place at the time when the ḥāl occurred. For example:\n\nجَاءَ زَيْدٌ وٱلشَّمْسُ طَالِعَةٌ [مغني اللبيب لابن هشام 606 cited by معاني النحو 2/361]\n“Zayd came when the sun was risen.”\nسَأَزُورُكَ وٱلْقَمَرُ طَالِعٌ [معاني النحو 2/367]\n“I will visit you when the moon is risen.”\n\nThe و of ḥāl indicates that the person of ḥāl was already in the state described by the ḥāl before the event in the preceding statement occurred. For example:\n\nوَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَائِنَا [سورة البقرة 2:246 cited by معاني النحو 2/368]\n““And why should we not fight in the cause of Allāh when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?”\n\nThe و of ḥāl indicates that the ḥāl after it is something obvious and should be taken into account, when considering the preceding statement. For example:\n\nأَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَنْ تَدْخُلُوا ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُمْ مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ [سورة البقرة 2:214 cited by معاني النحو 2/367]\n“Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you?”\nأَرَأَيْتَ لَوْ مَضْمَضْتَ مِنَ الْمَاءِ وَأَنْتَ صَائِمٌ [سنن أبي داود :2385]\n“What do you think if you rinse your mouth with water while you are fasting?”\n\nThe و of ḥāl indicates that the ḥāl sentence is is describing something extraordinary. For example:\n\nعَبَرَ ٱلنَّهْرَ وَلَمْ يُحَرِّكْ يَدَهُ [معاني النحو 2/368]\n“He crossed the river while not (even) moving his hand!”\nدَخَلَ عَلَى ٱلْأَمِيرِ وَبِيَدِهِ سَيْفُهُ [معاني النحو 2/368]\n“He entered upon the commander while in his hand was his sword!”\n\nTo differentiate between a ḥāl and a attribute. For example:\n\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ [معاني النحو 2/368]\n“I saw a man (who) had wealth.”\n(The sentence عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ can be analyzed as a attribute.)\nرَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا وَعِنْدَهُ مَالٌ [معاني النحو 2/368]\n“I saw a man while he had wealth.”\n(The sentence عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ can only be analyzed as a ḥāl.)\n\n\nThere may be other purposes as well.29",

    "section": "35.17 A quasi-sentence as the ḥāl",
    "text": "35.17 A quasi-sentence as the ḥāl\n(Compare this section to section (ref).) A quasi-sentence, in this context, is a prepositional or adverbial phrase. For example: عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ “on the branch” and بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ “between the clouds”.\nJust like a complete sentence, a quasi-sentence too may occur as a ḥāl. For example:\n\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلْهِلَالَ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ [أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/285]\n“I saw the crescent between the clouds.”\n(بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ is analyzed as a ḥāl.)\nنَظَرْتُ ٱلْعُصْفُورَ عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ [جامع الدروس العربية لمصطفى الغلاييني 3/101]\n“I looked at the sparrow on the branch.”\nكتب عمر إلى أبي عبيدة بالشام [الأصول في النحو لابن السراج 2/52]\n“Ɛumar wrote to Abī Ɛubaydah in Syria.”\nفَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فِى زِينَتِهِ [سورة القصص 28:79 cited by أوضح المسالك لابن هشام 2/285]\n“So he came out before his people in his adornment.”\n(فِى زِينَتِهِ is analyzed as a ḥāl.30)\nوَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ [سورة آل عمران 3:46]\n“He will speak to the people in the cradle”\n(فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ has been analyzed as a ḥāl.31)\n\nNow, you might be thinking: Didn’t we learn in chapter (ref) that بَيْنَ is an adverb of place? So why are we now saying that it is a ḥāl?\nWell, first of all, we are saying that the quasi-sentence بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ is a ḥāl, not just بَيْنَ. Secondly, we say that the quasi-sentence is a ḥāl only loosely speaking.\nRemember that an adverb of time or place is governed by a verb. And the adverb of time or place indicates the time or place where the action of the verb occurred. In a sentence like (171) رَأَيْتُ ٱلْهِلَالَ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ, the crescent was between the clouds before the action of seeing took place. So, in this case, we say that بَيْنَ is an adverb of place, but it is governed, not by the verb رَأَىٰ, but by an implied general beingness (see section (ref)) So it is as if we are saying:\n“I saw the crescent (while it was) [being]between the clouds.”\nAnd it is this implied general beingness which is technically the ḥāl.32 While بَيْنَ remains (technically) an adverb of place.\nBecause the actual ḥāl “being” is (necessarily) unexpressed and only implied, we can loosely say that the quasi-sentence بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ is a ḥāl.\nSimilarly, in example (172) نَظَرْتُ ٱلْعُصْفُورَ عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ, the prepositional phrase عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ is governed, not by the verb نَظَرَ but by an implied verb “being” which is the true ḥāl. But, loosely speaking, we may say that the quasi-sentence عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ is the ḥāl.\nSimilarly, in example (173) كتب عمر إلى أبي عبيدة بالشام, the act of writing was dony by Ɛumar in al-Ḥijāz, not in Syria. So the prepositional phrase بالشام is describing the state of Abū Ɛubaydah while he was in Syria.\nThis is yet another instance of where the lines between different types of adverbs get blurred. In fact, some grammarians have classified the ḥāl to be of the same class of adverbs as the adverb of time and the adverb of place.33\nFrom the perspective of meaning, the quasi-sentence بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ “between the clouds” describes the state of the person of ḥāl ٱلْهِلَالُ during the occurrence of the verb رَأَىٰ. Similarly, the quasi-sentence عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ “on the branch” describes the state of the person of ḥāl ٱلْعُصْفُور during the occurrence of the verb نَظَرَ.\n\nHere is an example of where the quasi-sentence does not work as a ḥāl:\n\nوَقَعَ ٱلْحَجَرُ فِي ٱلْحُفْرَةِ\n“The stone fell in the pit.”\n\nIn the above example, the stone went in the pit due to the action of the verb وَقَعَ. So the preposition فِي is governed by the verb وَقَعَ. Because فِي is not governed by an implied governor meaning “being”, therefore, the quasi-sentence فِي ٱلْحُفْرَةِ is not a ḥāl.\nOne indicator to test if the quasi-sentence is valid as ḥāl in any particular sentence, is to insert a و of ḥāl and a pronoun (referring to the person of ḥāl) before the quasi-sentence (thus making it a complete sentence). The purpose of the و of ḥāl, here, is to make the ḥāl a pre-existing state. If the resulting expression (with the و of ḥāl is interpreted as making the ḥāl a pre-existing state) retains the same meaning as the original, then the quasi-sentence could be valid as a ḥāl. Let’s use this test on some of the examples above.\n\nوَقَعَ ٱلْحَجَرُ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلْحُفْرَةِ\n“The stone fell while it had already been in the pit.”\n(This does not retain the same meaning as the original وَقَعَ ٱلْحَجَرُ فِي ٱلْحُفْرَةِ. So the quasi-sentence in the original example is not a ḥāl.)\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلْهِلَالَ وَهُوَ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ\n“I saw the crescent while it had already been between the clouds.”\n(This retains the meaning of the original رَأَيْتُ ٱلْهِلَالَ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّحَابِ. So the quasi-sentence in the original example is valid as a ḥāl.)\nنَظَرْتُ ٱلْعُصْفُورَ وَهُوَ عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ\n“I looked at the sparrow while it had already been on the branch.”\n(This retains the meaning of the original نَظَرْتُ ٱلْعُصْفُورَ عَلَى ٱلْغُصْنِ. So the quasi-sentence in the original example is valid as a ḥāl.)\n\nThere may be examples where a quasi-sentence could be validly interpreted either as a ḥāl (governed by an implied governor meaning “being”), or as governed by an overt verb.34 For example:\n\nرأيتُ زيدًا في الدار [الأصول في النحو لابن السراج 2/52]\n“I saw Zayd in the house.”\n\nWithout context, the prepositional phrase في الدار could either be governed by رَأَىٰ, signifying that the act of seeing was done in the house. Or it could be governed by the implication of general beingness, as a ḥāl for زَيْد.35\nA quasi-sentence can only be a ḥāl if it is governed by an implied (unexpressed) governor. This implicated governor will typically be general beingness, as in the examples above.36 In fact, some grammarians insist that the implied governor can only be general beingness.37 However, it is conceivable that the implied governor of the preposition be interpreted, if not formally then at least in meaning, as some other verb (or verbal noun).38 For example:\n\nرَبَّنَا وَءَاتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ [سورة آل عمران 3:194]\n“Our Lord, and grant us what You promised us through Your messengers”\n\nIn one interpretation of the above āyah, the prepositional phrase عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ “through Your messengers” has been analyzed as ḥāl of مَا وَعَدتَّنَا “what You promised us” The meaning with the implicated governor has been explained as مُنَزَّلًا عَلَيْهِمْ “sent down on [Your messengers].”39",

    "section": "35.18 Interpreting a sentence as a ḥāl vs. a attribute",
    "text": "35.18 Interpreting a sentence as a ḥāl vs. a attribute\nWe have just seen how a sentence (or quasi-sentence) can be intrepreted as a ḥāl. And we already know that a sentence (or quasi-sentence) can be intrepreted as a attribute. So how can we tell when a sentence (or quasi-sentence) is a ḥāl vs. when it is a attribute?\nWe may use the following guidelines40:\n\nWhen a sentence (or quasi-sentence) occurs after a specific definite noun, then it will be a ḥāl.\nAnd when a sentence (or quasi-sentence) occurs after a unspecified indefinite noun, then it will be a attribute.\nAnd when a sentence (or quasi-sentence) occurs after a generic definite noun or an specified indefinite noun then it may be interpreted as either a ḥāl or a attribute.\nHowever, in this case when both the attribute and the ḥāl interpretations are possible, one may still be preferred over the other depending on what the overall meaning and context demands.41\nThis is because when a sentence is interpreted as a ḥāl then it will be describing the state of the person of ḥāl. And when a sentence is interpreted as a attribute then it will be specifying or identifying the attributee.\n\nWhat we mean by a specific definite noun is one that refers to a specific entity. Not one that refers to a generic type (for which Arabic also uses the definite).\nFor example, in the sentence زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ “Zayd is in the house,” زَيْدٌ is a specific definite noun because it refers to a specific person. On the other hand, if we say ٱلْفِيلُ حَيَوانٌ “The elephant is an animal,” then we may be using ٱلْفِيل to refer to the species, and not a specific elephant. In this case, ٱلْفِيل is a generic definite noun.\nAnd what we mean by an unspecified indefinite noun is one that is not restricted by a attribute or other qualifier. So it is applicable to any entity denoted by that noun. For example, رَجُل in فِي ٱلدَّارِ رَجُلٌ is an unspecified indefinite noun. But in فِي ٱلدَّارِ رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ and فِي ٱلدَّارِ رَجُلُ خَيْرٍ it is a specified indefinite noun.\nHere are some examples of sentences analyzed as attributes or ḥāls:\n\nحَتَّىٰ تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ [سورة الإسراء 17:93 cited by مغني اللبيب لابن هشام 560]\n“until you bring down to us a book we may read”\n(نَقُرَؤُهُ is analyzed as a attribute because كِتَاب is an unspecified indefinite noun.)\nفَلَقَدْ رَأَيْتُهُ يَقِيهَا مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ بِنَفْسِهِ [صحيح مسلم :1699a]\n“for indeed I saw him protecting her from the stones with his [body].”\n(يَقِيهَا is analyzed as a ḥāl because the pronoun ه in رَأَيْتُهُ is a specific definite noun.)\nوَقَالُوا لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ [سورة الزخرف 43:31]\nAnd they said, “Why was this Qur’ān not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?”\n(مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ is a attribute to رَجُل. عَظِيم is a second attribute.)\nكَمَثَلِ ٱلْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا [سورة الجمعة 62:5 cited by مغني اللبيب لابن هشام 561]\n“is like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]”\n(ٱلْحِمَارِ is a generic definite noun. So, the sentence يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا has been analyzed as either a ḥāl or a attribute.42)\n\nConsider now the following example:\n\nوَقَالَ رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ [سورة غافر 40:28]\n“And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said,”\n\nIn the above example, there are two (quasi-) sentences after the first attribute مُؤْمِن:\n\nمِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ\nيَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ\n\nThere are now multiple possible interpretations:\nSince رَجُلٌ is now a specified indefinite noun (having been described by the attribute مُؤْمِنٌ) it is permissible for both مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ and يَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ to be ḥāls. Or مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ can be a attribute and يَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ can be a ḥāl. Or both مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ and يَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ can be attributes.43",

For example:\n\nفَنَادَتْهُ ٱلْمَلَائِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّی فِی ٱلْمِحْرَابِ [سورة آل عمران 3:39]\n“So the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber,”\n(هُوَ قَائِمٌ and يُصَلِّی فِی ٱلْمِحْرَابِ have both been analyzed as ḥāls as one interpretation.44)\n\nWhen one or more of these multiple ḥāls is a sentence or quasi-sentence, then it is usual, though not imperative, that the ḥāls be in the following order45:\n\nFirst, any ḥāls that are comprised of a single word\nThen any quasi-sentence ḥāls\nThen any sentence ḥāls\n\nThis is the same order that is usually followed for attributes as well.\nHere is an example:\n\nفَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ [سورة القصص 28:21]\n“So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension].”",

    "section": "",
    "text": "36.1 Introduction\nConsider the sentence:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\n“I saw the man.”\nIf the listener (or reader) can identify the individual referred to by the noun “the man” (maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker), then there is no problem with this sentence. But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring. This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.\nOne way is to use an adjectival noun to describe the noun. For example:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.\n“I saw the tall man.”\nAnother way is to use a pointing noun, thus:\nرَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\n“I saw that man.”\nBut sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. In this case, Arabic uses what is called a connected noun and a connecting sentence.  This example should help you understand what we mean:\nIn the above sentence, the connected noun is ٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī. It is applied to singular masculine nouns, like ٱلرَّجُل.  By itself it may be translated as “the one1m that/which/who/whom”.  It is called a connected noun because it is directly followed by, i.e. connected to, a connecting sentence. The connecting sentence contains necessary information for the listener to correctly identify the individual that the connected noun refers to. The connecting sentence in the above example is the sentence لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ “I met him yesterday.”\nNote by the way, that we did not translate the pronoun “him” in our original translation (above). This is because it would sound unnatural in English to say: “I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met him yesterday.” But this pronoun is an essential part of the Arabic connecting sentence and is called the refer-back pronoun. We will deal with it in section @ref(refer-back-pronoun) later in this chapter.\nThere are two types of connected nouns:\nWe will study both these types separately within this chapter.",

    "text": "36.2 The specific connected nouns\nThe specific connected nouns have a significance which is restricted to a specific individual or category of individuals, and its connecting sentence should contain sufficient information to identify that specific individual.\nThe specific connected nouns is a group of nouns where each noun is applied to a gender and number of individuals. They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconnected noun\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī\nSingular masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَلَّتِي ʾallatī\nSingular feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Also used for plural non-intelligent beings of both genders. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّذَانِ ʾallad͡hānī\nDual masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: ٱَللَّذَيْنِ ʾallad͡hayni in the a-state and i-state. Two ل’s in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّتَانِ ʾallatānī\nDual feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: ٱَللَّتَيْنِ ʾallatayni in the a-state and i-state. Two ل’s in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَلَّذِينَ ʾallad͡hīna\nPlural masculine. For both intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّاتِي ʾallātī\nFor plural feminine intelligent beings. Also used for non-intelligent beings of both genders but ٱَلَّتِي is more common there. Rigid. Two ل’s in its spelling. Has the following variants: ٱَللَّاتِ ʾallāti, ٱَللَّائِي ʾallāʾī, ٱَللَّوَاتِي ʾallawātī\n\n\n\n\n36.2.1 Grammatical position of the specific connected noun\nConsider again the same example:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.\n“I saw the [specific] man whom I met yesterday.”\nIn this example, the connected noun ٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī is a attribute (in the a-state) to the described noun  ٱلرَّجُلَ. Because ٱَلَّذِي is a rigid noun, it will appear the same in all states without any change to its ending.\nAs a attribute, the connected noun may also come as the last in a series of attributes, and can also be combined with a pointing noun. For example:\nرَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.\n“I saw that [specific] tall man whom I met yesterday.”\nBut connected nouns need not only occur as attributes.  They may occur in various grammatical positions. Here are some examples: \nAs a subject:\nوَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنْفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّـٰهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ \n“And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allāh - give them tidings of a painful punishment.”سورة التوبة 9:34\nAs an info:\nخِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَكُمْ \n“The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you”صحيح مسلم :1855\nهُنَّ اللَّوَاتِي عَلَى الْمِنْبَرِ \n“They are the ones which (are) on the pulpit.”سنن الدارمي :36\nAs a doer:\nقَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.\n“The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us.”\nAs a direct doee:\nرَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ \n“Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men”سورة فصلت 41:29\nFollowing a preposition:\nأَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ \n“Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township”سورة البقرة 2:259\nAs a base noun in an annexation:\nقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا \n“Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]”سورة المجادلة 58:1",

    "section": "36.3 The refer-back pronoun",
    "text": "36.3 The refer-back pronoun\nThe connecting sentence is directly follows the connected noun. As we mentioned in the introduction, the connecting sentence provides clarifying information for the listener (or reader) to identify the individual referred to by the connected noun.\n\nIn the connecting sentence is a pronoun that refers back to the connected noun. This pronoun is called the refer-back pronoun. and it is an essential (though not always apparent) part of the connecting sentence.\nLet us identify some of the refer-back pronouns in the examples we have given.\nوَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ\n“And those who hoard gold and silver”\nrefer-back pronoun: the plural masculine doer pronoun و in يَكْنِزُونَ\nخِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ\n“The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you”\nrefer-back pronoun: the plural masculine direct doee attached pronoun هُمْ in تُحِبُّونَهُمْ\nقَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.\n“The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us.”\nrefer-back pronoun: the singular masculine direct doee attached pronoun هُ in قُلْتُمُوهُ\nرَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ\n“Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men”\nrefer-back pronoun: the dual masculine doer pronoun ا in أَضَلَّانَا\nأَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ\n“Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township”\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular masculine doer pronoun “he” in مَرَّ\nقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا\n“Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]”\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular feminine doer pronoun “she” in تُجَادِلُكَ\n\n36.3.1 Matching the refer-back pronoun with the connected noun\nThe refer-back pronoun matches the specific connected noun in gender and number. And the refer-back pronoun is generally an absent-person pronoun (هُ, هَا, هُوَ, هُمْ, etc.). In the example وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ “And those who hoard gold and silver,” the refer-back pronoun is the plural masculine absent-person doer pronoun و “they” in يَكْنِزُونَ “they hoard”. And it matches the plural masculine connected noun ٱلَّذِينَ.\nHowever, there is an exception to the refer-back pronoun being an absent-person pronoun. And that is when the connected noun refers to the speaker or the addressed person, like أَنَا ٱلَّذِي, or أَنْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ, etc. In these cases, the refer-back pronoun may optionally:\n\neither be an absent-person pronoun to match the connected noun (as usual),\nor match the pronoun for the speaker or addressed person (as the case may be)\n\nThe latter is generally more common but both options are permissible. For example:\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرْتُ.\nrefer-back pronoun: the singular masculine doer pronoun for the speaker تُ in حَضَرْتُ\nor\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرَ.\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular masculine doer pronoun for the absent person “he” in حَضَرَ\n“I am the one (who) was present.”\nHere are some examples from Classical Arabic:\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي سَمَّتْنِ أُمِّي حَيْدَرَهْ \n“I am the one whom my mother named Ḥaydarah”\n(The refer-back pronoun is the speaker person’s direct doee pronoun in سَمَّتْنِ, which is an abbreviation of سَمَّتْنِي “she named me”.)Wright 2/324B\nفَقَالَ مُوسَى يَا آدَمُ أَنْتَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكَ اللَّهُ بِيَدِهِ \n“Mūsā said: O Ādam, you are the one whom Allāh created with His Hand”\n(The refer-back pronoun is the addressed person’s direct doee pronoun كَ in خَلَقَكَ.)جامع الترمذي :2134\nThere is one circumstance where matching the refer-back pronoun to the (absent person) connected noun is mandated. And that is when the connected noun is the called-out person using the particle أَيُّهَا or أَيَّتُهَا. For example,\nيَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا\n“O you who have believed”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنْتُمْ\nSimilarly,\nيَاأَيُّهَا الَّذِي نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ \n“O you upon whom the message has been sent down”سورة الحجر 15:6",

    "section": "36.4 The general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا",
    "text": "36.4 The general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا\nThe general connected nouns are unrestricted in significance, and may be applied to any individual who fits the criteria given in the connecting sentence. The most commonly general connected nouns are:\n\nمَنْ man. Typically used for intelligent beings and translated as “who”.\nمَا mā. Typically used for non-intelligent beings and translated as “what”.\nأَيّ ʾayy. Used for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Translated as “which”, “whichever” or “any”.\n\nThere are also a couple of rarely or dialectally used general connected nouns that we will not cover. These are  ذُو d͡hū, and ذَا d͡hā.\nIn this section we will deal with مَنْ and مَا. We will deal with أَيّ separately in section (give ref) later in this chapter.\nUnlike the specific connected nouns (ٱَلَّذِي, etc.), the general connected nouns do not vary for number and gender.\nFor example:\nأُحِبُّّ مَنْ يَعْدِلُ [Wright 2/322A]\n“I love [him] who is just.”\n\nوَمِنْهُم مَّن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ\n[سورة يونس 10:42] “And among them are those who listen to you.”\nٱِصْنَعْ مَا بَدَا لَكَ.\n“Do what seems (good) to you.”\nمَرَرْتُ بِمَا يُعْجِبُكَ.\n“I passed by what will please you.”\nعرفت ما اشتريته، وما اشتريتهما، وما اشتريتها، وما اشتريتهن [https://shamela.ws/book/13257/195]\n\n36.4.1 مَنْ and مَا after prepositions\nWhen مَنْ and مَا are directly preceded by the prepositions مِنْ and عَنْ, these prepositions lose their ن and are joined to the following noun with the noun’s م doubled. For example: مَمَّنْ mimman, مَمَّا mimmā, عَمَّنْ ɛamman, عَمَّا ɛammā.\nThe preposition فِي is also often (though not always) optionally attached to these connected nouns, thus: فِيمَنْ fīman, فِيمَا fīmā.\nThe remaining prepositions follow the normal rules: عَلَى مَا, كَمَنْ, etc. But we will see, if Allāh wills, in chapter @ref(questions), that مَا and مَنْ are also used as question nouns, in which case the rules of joining prepositions to them will differ.\n\n\n36.4.2 The refer-back pronoun for the general connected nouns\nThe general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا are themselves singular masculine in number and gender. However, they can be used to signify persons or things of any number and gender.\nTheir refer-back pronouns can then, optionally:\n\nEither match the gender and number of the persons or things meant by the connected noun. For example, for مَنْ:\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ [سورة يونس 10:42]\n“And among them are those who listen to you”\nقَدْ خَابَتْ مَنْ فَعَلَتْ ذَلِكَ مِنْهُنَّ وَخَسِرَتْ [جامع الترمذي :3318]\n“She has thwarted herself, whoever did that from them3f, and lost.”\nNote also how, in this example how, in addition to the feminine refer-back doer pronouns in فَعَلَتْ and خَسِرَتْ, the feminine gender of the person signified by مَنْ has also caused the تْ of femininity to be added to the verb خَابَ (of which مَنْ is the doer noun).\nExamples for مَا: \nعرفت ما اشتريته، وما اشتريتهما، وما اشتريتها، وما اشتريتهن [https://shamela.ws/book/13257/195]\nOr be singular masculine to match the connected noun itself. This is generally more common for مَا. For example:\nوَمِنْهُم مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ [سورة يونس 10:40]\n“And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe in it.”\nجَمَعْتُ مِنَ ٱلْوَرَقِ مَا سَقَطَ. “I gathered what fell from the leaves.”\nصَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا يَتَيَسَّرُ.\n“Pray from the units (of prayer) what is easy.”\nلَمْ أَجِدْ مَا أَعْتَذِرُ بِهِ [مساوئ الأخلاق للخرائطي:171]\n“I did not find what I (could) make an excuse for with”.\n\nBoth options can be utilized together as well. For example:\nبَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌۭ فَلَهُۥٓ أَجْرُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ \n“Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Islām to Allāh while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.”سورة البقرة 2:112\nفَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ \n“whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.”سورة البقرة 2:38\n\n\n\n36.4.3 Applicability of مَا and مَنْ to intelligent and non-intelligent beings\nAs we mentioned earlier, مَنْ is typically used to refer to intelligent beings. And مَا is typically used to refer to non-intelligent beings. However, there are some circumstances in which these roles can differ.\nمَنْ may be used for non-intelligent beings when a non-intelligent being is compared with an intelligent being. For example,\n\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِّن مَّاءٍ ۖ فَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ أَرْبَعٍ ۚ\n\nسورة النور 24:45\n\n“Allāh has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four.”\nمَنْ may also be used for non-intelligent beings when attributes usually applicable to intelligent beings are applied to a non-intelligent being. For example:\nأَسِرْبَ الْقَطَا، هَلْ مَنْ يُعِيرُ جَنَاحَه * لَعَلِّي إِلَىٰ مَنْ قَدْ هَوِيتُ أَطِيرُ \nO flock of birds, is there who will lend his wing\nthat perhaps I may fly to whom I love\nأَ: “O”, سِرْب: “flock”, قَطَا: a species of bird, هَلْ: “is there?”, يُعِيرُ: “lend”, جَنَاح: “wing”, لَعَلِّي: “Perhaps I”, هَوِيتُ: “I love”, أَطِيرُ: “I fly”.Wright 2/314D\nمَنْ may also be used for non-intelligent beings when there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings, and the intelligent beings are given preference. For example:\nوَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ \n“And to Allāh prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth”سورة الرعد 13:15\nSimilarly, مَا may, in some circumstances, be used for intelligent beings. This may be when there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings, and the non-intelligent beings are given preference because of their larger number. For example:\nيُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ \n“Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allāh”سورة الجمعة 62:1\nمَا may also be used for intelligent beings when the person being referred to is vague to the speaker. For example:\nرَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا \n“My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service]”سورة آل عمران 3:35\nمَا may also be used for intelligent beings when the characteristics of an intelligent being are highlighted when referring to them. For example:\nفَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ \n“then marry those that please you of [other] women”سورة النساء 4:3\n\n\n\n36.4.4 Grammatical position of the general connected nouns\nThe general connected noun may occur in various grammatical positions. Here are some examples:\nAs a subject:\nما عِنْدَكُمْ يَنْفَدُ \n“Whatever you have will end”سورة النحل 16:96\nAs an info:\nمَالُكَ مَا قَدَّمْتَ، وَمَالُ وَارِثِكَ مَا أَخَّرْتَ \n“Your wealth is what you have sent forward, and the wealth of your inheritors is what you have left behind.”الأدب المفرد :153\nAs a doer:\nفَعَلَهُ مَنْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنِّي \n“it was done by one who was better than I”صحيح البخاري :668\nAs a direct doee:\nاعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ \n“Do whatever you will”سورة فصلت 41:40\nFollowing a preposition:\nوَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ \n“and make me independent from (all) who are besides You”جامع الترمذي :3563\nAs a base noun in an annexation:\n\nفَذَلِكَ مَثَلُ مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي \n“So that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me”صحيح مسلم :2283\nمَا تَرَىٰ رَأْيَ مَا نَرَىٰ. \n“You do not think what we think.”\n(literally: “You do not opine the opinion of what we opine.”)Fischer 218\nأَمْرَ مَا تَحْذَرُ \n“the matter of which you are wary”Fischer 218\nUnlike the specific connected nouns (ٱَلَّذِي, etc), the general connected nouns do not occur as attributes. So while we can say:\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\n“I passed by the man who was good to me.”\nwe cannot say:\n\\(\\times\\) مَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\nWe will have to say instead:\nمَرَرْتُ بِمَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\nThe general connected noun can, however, occur as a replacement. For example,\nوالمسلمون مَن تبع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كثير \n“And the Muslims, who follow the Messenger of Allāh, are many”Fischer §421.2. Originally, from السيرة النبوية لابن هشام.\n\n\n36.4.5 Use with the preposition مِنْ\nThe preposition مِنْ is frequently used with the general connected nouns to restrict the applicability of the connected noun to a group or type. This مِنْ may come either before the connected noun, or after its connecting sentence. For example:\n\nفَأَعْطَانِي مَا كَانَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْ خُبْزٍ. \n“Then he gave me what he had of bread.”Fischer 218\nمَنْ دَخَلَ ٱلشَّأْمَ مِنَ ٱلْعَرَبِ \n“Those Arabs who entered Syria”\n(literally: “Who entered Syria from the Arabs”)Fischer 218\nفَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ \n“then marry those that please you of [other] women”سورة النساء 4:3\nاللَّهُمَّ اقْسِمْ لَنَا مِنْ خَشْيَتِكَ مَا يَحُولُ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ مَعَاصِيكَ \nO Allāh, apportion for us, from the fear of You, (that) what shall come between us and disobedience of You\n(The connected noun مَا is the direct doee of the verb of command اقْسِمْ.)جامع الترمذي :3502\n\n\n36.4.6 Use with a repeated word to express vagueness or uncertainty\nThe general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا are used with a word that is repeated to express a vague or uncertain quantity or quality. For example:\nهُمْ مَا هُمْ \n“They are what they are.”Fischer 218\nنَزَلَ مَنْ نَزَلَ مِنْهُمْ \n“Some of them came down.”\n(literally: Came down who came down from them.”)Fischer 218\nجَمَعْتُ مَا جَمَعْتُ \n“I gathered what I gathered.”Fischer 218",

    "text": "36.5 Deleting the refer-back pronoun\nThe refer-back pronoun may be deleted (and its meaning is then implicit) if some conditions are satisfied. Some conditions are specific to the state of the refer-back pronoun. These are:\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is the subject of a nounal sentence, then it may be deleted, and its meaning will be implied. When deleting the refer-back pronoun in this case, it is preferred that the connecting sentence not be too short. \nFor example:\nانْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [صحيح مسلم :2963c] 1\n“Look at who is lower than you.”\n(instead of انْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ هُوَ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ.)\nوَلَهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ [سورة الأنبياء 21:19]\n“To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth.”\n(instead of مَنْ هُوَ فِي ٱلسَّمَوَاتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ)\nمَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا [Wright 2/322D]\nI am not the one who says anything to you.\n(instead of مَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا)\nIf the connecting sentence is very short, the deleting the refer-back pronoun subject is permissible, though rare. For example:\n\nلَا يَنْطِقُ بِمَا سَفَهٌ [Wright 2/322D]\n“He does not speak what is foolish.”\n(instead of بِمَا هُوَ سَفَهٌ)\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is an attached pronoun for the direct doee it is permissible to delete it. For example:\nهَـٰذَا مَا كَنَزْتُمْ لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ [سورة التوبة 9:35]\n“This is what you hoarded for yourselves”\n(instead of مَا كَنَزْتُمُوهُ)\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is in the i-state, it is permissible to delete it:\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is the base noun in an annexation whose annexe noun is a doer participle or the direct doee implying a present or future meaning. For example:\n\nفَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضٍ [سورة طه 20:72]\n“So decree whatever you are to decree.”\n(instead of فَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضِيهِ)\nقَالَ أَتَبْعَثُ إِلَيَّ مَا لَسْتَ آكِلًا [https://hadithweb.com/ahmad:21023]\n“He said: Do you send to me what you do not eat?”\n(instead of مَا لَسْتَ آكِلَهُ)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is attached to a preposition or adverb, and the same preposition or adverb has already been used (with the same meaning) with the connecting noun or its described noun. The preposition/adverb is deleted along with its attached pronoun. For example:\n\nأَنَا عِنْدَ مَنْ أَنْتَ. [Wright 2/323C]\n“I am at his [house] at whose you (are).”\n(instead of مَنْ أَنْتَ عِنْدَهُ)\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ سُلَيْمَانُ. [Wright 2/323D]\n“I passed by the (same) one that Sulaymān did.”\n(instead of مَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ بِهِ سُلَيْمَانُ.)\n\n\nIn addition to the above conditions that are specific to the state of the refer-back pronoun, a further, general, condition should be satisfied, which is: that the omission of the refer-back pronoun be obvious to the listener, and the listener can re-construct the original meaning by restoring the refer-back pronoun to get the intended meaning.\nIf the refer-back pronoun is deleted, and the remaining connecting sentence (with the refer-back pronoun deleted) is valid as a connecting sentence on its own right, then it will give a different meaning (even if slightly) from the original. And the listener will not know that the refer-back pronoun has been deleted. In this case, it is not permitted to delete the refer-back pronoun. Here is an example that should explain what we mean:\nConsider the sentence:\nجاء الذي ضربته في داره. \n“The one whom I beat (him) in his house, came.شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/168\nThe connecting sentence is ضربته في داره. “I beat him in his house.” and the refer-back pronoun is the a-state direct doee pronoun ه “him”. If we delete this pronoun, the sentence becomes\nجاء الذي ضربت في داره.\n“The one who I beat in his house, came.\nNow the meaning of the sentence is markedly different. The connecting sentence ضربت فِي دَارِهِ is valid on its own right but it gives a different meaning from the original. It does not specify that I beat him in his house, just that I beat in his house, possibly others. Because the omission of the refer-back pronoun is not obvious, the sentence now does not siginify the original intent. And so deleting the refer-back pronoun in this case is not permitted.",

    "text": "36.6 The general connected noun أَيّ\nأَيّ ʾayy “which/whichever” is a general connected noun similar to مَا “what” and مَنْ “who”. But it differs from مَا and مَنْ in a few aspects:\nFirstly, أيّ is (generally) fully flexible. So it will display its state as a vowel mark on its final letter. Whereas مَا and مَنْ, as we know, are rigid.\nSecondly, أيّ can be, and, in fact, properly is, the annexe noun in an annexation. Whereas مَا and مَنْ cannot be annexe nouns. For example,\nيُعْجِبُنِي أَيُّ ٱلتَّلَامِذَةِ يَجْتَهِدُ.\n“Whichever of the students strives, pleases me.”\n(أيّ is in the u-state)\n\nفَأْوِ إِلَى أَيِّهِمْ يَحْمِيكَ.\n“So take shelter with whichever of them protects you.”\n(أيّ is in the i-state)\nAlso, أيّ is used indiscriminately for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. For example,\nأَحْمِلُ أَيَّ ٱلْحَقِيبَتَيْنِ هِيَ ٱلْأَثْقَلُ\n“I shall carry whichever of the two bags is the heavier.”\n(أيّ is in the a-state)\nNote how, in the above examples, the final vowel mark on أيّ varies, depending on its state due to its being a flexible noun.\nأَيّ, like مَا and مَنْ, is itself a singular masculine noun. And, like مَا and مَنْ, أَيّ can be used, unchanged, for both genders. The previous example used أَيّ with حَقِيبَة which is a feminine noun. But a feminine version أَيَّة does exist and can be used with feminine base nouns. It is, however, only commonly used if its base noun is a feminine pronoun. For example,\nصَادِقِي أَيَّتَهُنَّ تَنْصَحُكِ.\n“Befriend whichever of them3,f is sincere to you1,f.”\nBy the way, أَيّ ʾayy (like مَا and مَنْ) is also a question noun and we will discuss its properties in more detail in section …\n\n36.6.1 The connected noun أَيّ without a base noun\nأيّ can sometimes occur without a base noun. Technically, it will then be indefinite, and thus tanwīned. However, it will carry the meaning of an implied annexation. For example,\nسَأُقَاتِلُ أَيًّا يُقَاوِمُنِي.\n“I will fight whichever [of them, the enemies, etc.] resists me.”\n\n\n36.6.2 The connected noun أَيّ with a deleted refer-back pronoun\nConsistent with what we have already learned for the other connected nouns, the refer-back pronoun may be deleted in connected sentences for the connected noun أيّ.\nFor example,\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\n(instead of أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ.)\n\n\n36.6.3 Circumstance for the rigidity of أَيّ\nAs mentioned, أَيّ is generally fully flexible. However, there is one circumstance in which it may optionally be a rigid noun with the final vowel mark ◌ُ thus: أَيُّ. This is when both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nأَيّ is an annexe noun.\nThe refer-back pronoun to أَيّ is the subject of the connecting sentence and it is deleted.\n\nFor example,\nأَجْزِي أَيُّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\nSince this rigidity is optional, أَيّ may, in this case, retain its full-flexibility:\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\nBut if both the conditions above are not satisfied then أَيّ shall remain fully-flexible. For example,\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ.\nأَجْزِي أَيًّا هُوَ صَادِقٌ.\nأَجْزِي أَيًّا صَادِقٌ. 2",

    "section": "36.9 Sentences without connected nouns",
    "text": "36.9 Sentences without connected nouns\nThere are some sentences where we might expect a connected noun but which are always, or often (as the case may be), expressed in Arabic without a connected noun. These sentences are of different types:\n\n36.9.1 Sentences with indefinite nouns needing a qualifying sentence\nWhen an indefinite noun needs a qualifying sentence, it is natural in English to insert “that”, “which”, “who”, etc. between the noun and the following sentence. For example, “I passed by a man who was sleeping.”\nIn Arabic, however, we will not use any connected noun in such sentences. This is because the connected nouns are considered definite nouns. And therefore they may not be a attribute to an indefinite noun. So while we can say:\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.\n“I passed by the man who is sleeping.”\nwe cannot say\n\\(\\times\\) مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.\nInstead, we put the qualifying sentence directly after the indefinite noun. The qualifying sentence will then not be a connecting sentence, but will itself be the attribute to the described noun:\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَنَامُ.\n“I passed by a man (who) is sleeping.”\nHere is another example:\n\nجَلَسْتُ فِي مَجْلِسٍ قَدْ رُشَّ بِمَاءِ ٱلْوَرْدِ.\n“I sat in a sitting (that) had been sprinkled with rose-water.”\nA connected noun can, however, follow an indefinite noun, if we intend to start a separate sentence with it, or if it is a replacement (see chapter @ref(the-replacement)). For example.\nوَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ \n“Resurrect him to a praiseworthy station, the one that you promised him”صحيح البخاري :614\nوَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ\nالَّذِي جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ \n“Woe to every scorner and mocker\nWho collects wealth and [continuously] counts it.”سورة الهمزة 104:1-2\n\n\n36.9.2 Sentences containing a noun with generic definiteness\nSometimes the definite article ٱَلْ does not determine a particular individual, but makes a noun definite only in a generic way. In this case a qualifying sentence may directly follow it without any intermediate connected noun used as a attribute.3 Because there is no connected noun, the qualifying sentence is, again, not analyzed as a connecting sentence. For example:\nكَمَثَلِ الْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا \n“like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]”\n(Note how the translator has translated ٱلْحِمَار as “a donkey” because in English an indefinite noun is often used to indicate a generic type.)سورة الجمعة 62:5\nأَنْتَ ٱلْوَزِيرُ لَا يُعْصَىٰ \n“You are the (sort of) vizier (who) is not disobeyed.”Fischer 219\nهُمُ ٱلْفَوَارِسُ يَحْمُونَ ٱلنِّسَاءَ. \n“They are the (kind of) horsemen (who) protect the women.”Fischer 219\n\n\n36.9.3 Sentences with prepositional or adverbial phrases\nIf a sentence has a definite noun which is to be qualified by a prepositional or adverbial phrase, then in many cases, that phrase may directly follow the definite noun without any intermediate connected noun used a attribute. But using a connected noun is also permissible if one wishes to emphasize that the specificity of the noun. When there is no connected noun, the prepositional or adverbial phrase is not analyzed as a connecting sentence, but is considered attached to an implied verb that has the idea of “being”, like “is”, “are”, etc. When there is a connected noun, then it is analyzed as a connecting sentence, as usual. For example:\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\n“I walked in the garden next to the mosque.”\nor\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\nor\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي هِيَ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\n“I walked in the [specific] garden that [is] next to the mosque.”",

    "section": "37.2 مَا and مَنْ",
    "text": "37.2 مَا and مَنْ\n\n37.2.1 Position of question words in the beginning of the sentence\nAll question words typically occur in the beginning of the question sentence. (Particles like وَ, فَ, etc. are allowed to precede them.) For example,\nمَنْ أَنْتَ؟ \n“Who are you?”Wright 2/311D\nوَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ؟ \n“And what is that in your right hand?”سورة طه 20:17\nIn both the above examples, the question nouns مَا and مَنْ are in the u-state as the subject of their respective question sentences.\nWhen the question is asking about the direct doee of a verb, then too is the question noun placed in the beginning of the sentence. For example,\nمَا تَقُولُ؟ \n“What do you say?”Wright 2/312A\nمَنْ قَتَلْتَ؟ \n“Whom did you kill?”Wright 2/311D\nمَا فَرَضَ رَبُّكَ عَلَىٰ أُمَّتِكَ؟ \n“What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah?”صحيح مسلم :162a\nIn the above three examples, the question nouns مَا and مَنْ are analyzed as the a-state direct doee of the verb following it.\nThe question nouns are exempted from being placed in the beginning of the question noun when they are in the i-state: either following a preposition, or as the base noun in an annexation. For example,\nلِمَنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقَصْرُ؟ \n“Whose is this palace?”جامع الترمذي :3688\nبِنْتُ مَنْ أَنْتِ؟ \n“Whose daughter are you?”Wright 2/311D\n\n\n37.2.2 مَا shortened to مَ in the i-state\nWhen the question noun مَا mā is in the i-state it is typically shortened to مَ ma. Example:\nبِمَ يَرْجِعُ؟ \n“With what does he return?”سنن ابن ماجه :4108\nThis shortened مَ is also usually joined to the preposition before it, even for prepositions constituting more than one letter (which don’t typically join to the word directly following it). So we get:\n\nبِمَ for بِمَا\nلِمَ for لِمَا\nفِيمَ for فِي مَا\nإِلَامَ for إِلَىٰ مَا\nعَلَامَ for عَلَىٰ مَا\nحَتَّامَ for حَتَّىٰ مَا\nمِمَّ for مِمَّا (مِنْ مَا)\nعَمَّ for عَمَّا (عَنْ مَا)\n\nWhen pausing on this shortened مَ, a هْ is appended to it to preserve the sound of the fat·ḥah. For example:\nلِمَهْ؟\nlimah?\n“For what?”\nThe shortened مَ is also used when it is the base noun in an annexation. However, in this case it won’t be joined to the previous word. For example:\nمِثْلُ مَ أَنْتَ؟ \n“What are you like?”Wright 1/275A\n\n\n37.2.3 مَا and مَنْ referred back to with an i-state pronoun\nAs an alternative to placing the question noun مَا or مَنْ after the preposition or annexe noun, the question noun may be placed in the beginning of the sentence and it is referred back to by a pronoun. For example,\nقُلْ مَنْ بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ \nSay, “In whose hand is the realm of all things”سورة المؤمنون 23:88\nمَاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ \n“for which [aspect] of it would the criminals be impatient?”سورة يونس 10:50\n\n\n37.2.4 Verb gender when inquiring about the doer of a verb\nThe question nouns مَا and مَنْ are themselves masculine singular nouns. But they can be used to ask abount nouns of any gender or number. For example,\nوَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ؟ \n“And what is that in your right hand?”سورة طه 20:17\nمَنْ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالُ؟\n“Who are these men?”\nWhen inquiring about the doer of a verb, then the verb is usually construed with a masculine singular doer to match the question noun. For example:\nمَنْ جَاءَ؟\n“Who has come?”\nمَا يُبْكِيكَ؟ \n“What makes you cry?”جامع الترمذي :3894\nOcassionally, the feminine verb may be used if asking about a feminine doer. For example:\nمَنْ كَانَتْ أُمَّكَ؟ 1 \n“Who was your mother?”Wright 2/313C\n\nIf the question is regarding a specific number and gender, then we are more likely to insert the corresponding specific connected noun (ٱلَّذِي, etc.) between the question noun مَن and the verb. For example:\nمَنِ اللَّتَانِ تَظَاهَرَتَا عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنْ أَزْوَاجِهِ \n“Who are the ones2f, from his wives, who aided one another against the Prophet ﷺ?صحيح البخاري :4913\nNote that now the dual feminine doer pronoun ا in تَظَاهَرَتَا is the refer-back pronoun that refers back to the connected noun ٱللَّتَانِ.\n\n\n37.2.5 An indefinite noun after مَا and مَنْ\nThe question nouns مَا and مَنْ cannot occur as annexe nouns. Nor can either of them be a replacee. So any indefinite noun after them must necessarily be the info of the question sentence. For example, مَنْ فَارِسٌ؟  can only mean, “Who is a horseman?” not “Who horseman?” or “Which horseman?”Wright 2/312C\n\n\n37.2.6 مَاذَا and مَنْ ذَا\nTo lend more force to the question or to make it more lively, ذَا may be appended to the question nouns مَا and مَنْ. For example,\nمَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ \n“What did your lord say?”صحيح البخاري :4800\nWith مَنْ ذَا especially, but also with مَا, the specific connected noun ٱلَّذِي is often appended as well. For example:\nمَنْ ذَا الَّذِي قَالَ هَذَا \n“Who is the one that said this?”سنن ابن ماجه :3802\nمَاذَا ٱلَّذِي تَقُولُ؟ \n“What is it that you say?”Wright 2/312B\nNote that ذَا is also a variant pointing noun meaning “this” or “that”. In which case, it can be the info of the question sentence by itself. For example:\n\nفَدَقَقْتُ الْبَابَ، فَقَالَ: مَنْ ذَا؟ فَقُلْتُ: أَنَا، قَالَ: أَنَا، أَنَا؟، كَأَنَّهُ كَرِهَهُ. \n“So I knocked at the door. He said, ‘Who is that?’ I said, ‘I.’ He said ‘I? I?’ as if he disliked it.”الأدب المفرد :1086\n\n\n37.2.7 Why\nArabic has no distinct question word for “why”. Instead, the question noun مَا is used with a preposition, typically لِ to give the meaning “For what?”. For example,\nلِمَ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ \n“Why did he do that?”صحيح مسلم :705b\nلِمَاذَا وَلَّيْتَ بَعْدَ مَجِيِّكَ إِلَىٰ هَـٰهُنَا؟ \n“Why did you turn back after your coming here?”Wright 2/312B\nSometimes, other prepositions like عَلَىٰ and بِ may be used. But this is dependent on the verb in the sentence. For example,\nعَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ \n“Why does one of you kill his brother?”\ni.e. “on what [basis]”مشكاة المصابيح :4562\nبِمَ يَأْخُذ أحدكُم مَال أَخِيه؟ \n“Why should any of you take his brother’s property?”\ni.e. “by what [justification]”مشكاة المصابيح :2840\nAnd often times, the meaning “why” is conveyed using مَا when a suitable verb exists. For example:\nمَا يُبْكِيكَ؟ \n“What makes you cry?”\ni.e. “Why are you crying?”جامع الترمذي :3894\n\n\n37.2.8 Applicability of مَا and مَنْ to intelligent and non-intelligent beings\nIn (give ref) we discussed how, sometimes, the connected noun مَا may be used for intelligent beings and مَنْ for non-intelligent beings. Those same guidelines apply for مَا and مَنْ when they are question nouns. For example, when inquiring about the nature or qualities of a person مَا may be used. Examples:\nفَقُلْتُ لَهُ مَا أَنْتَ قَالَ أَنَا نَبِيٌّ. فَقُلْتُ وَمَا نَبِيٌّ قَالَ أَرْسَلَنِي اللَّهُ \n“I said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am a prophet.’ So I said, ‘And who is a prophet?’ He said ‘Allāh has sent me.’”صحيح مسلم :832",

    "section": "37.3 أَيّ",
    "text": "37.3 أَيّ\nIn section .. we studied أَيّ as a general connected noun. Just like مَا and مَنْ, أَيّ too can be a question noun for “which” questions. Many of the rules that apply the question nouns مَا and مَنْ also apply to أَيّ. For example, the default position of أَيّ is in the beginning of the question sentence.\nHowever, أَيّ is also different from مَا and مَنْ in some respects. For example, consistent with what we learned in its use as a connected noun, the question noun أَيّ is a fully-flexible noun and can be used indiscriminately for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings.\nAlso, أَيّ is typically the annexe noun in an annexation. When أَيّ is a connected noun, then its base noun is usually definite. But when أَيّ is a question noun, then its base noun may be either definite or indefinite.\n\n37.3.1 أَيّ with a definite base noun\nWhen the base noun of أَيّ is a definite noun, the annexation has the meaning “which [one] of”. For example,\nفَأَيَّ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ تُنكِرُونَ \n“So which of the signs of Allāh do you deny?”سورة غافر 40:81\nأَيُّ الأَعْمَالِ أَفْضَلُ \n“Which of the deeds is best?”سنن أبي داود :1449\nفَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ \n“So which of the two parties has more right to security”سورة الأنعام 6:81\nمِنْ أَيِّ أَيَّامِ الشَّهْرِ كَانَ يَصُومُ \n“From which of the days of the month would he fast?”صحيح مسلم :1160\nAs in the examples above, the base noun in such a case is typically a plural or a dual. If the base noun is a definite singular noun, then there is an implied partitive meaning, i.e. “which part of”.2 For example,\n\nفِي أَيِّ طَعَامِهِ يُبَارَكُ لَهُ \n“in which (part) of his food is the blessing”سنن أبي داود :3845\nمِنْ أَيِّ الْمَالِ \n“From which (category) of wealth?”سنن أبي داود :4063\nHowever, if the noun is of generic definiteness then the partitive aspect indicates one out of the set that constitutes the generic type. In English the plural is often used to signify the generic type. For example the generic type ٱلْعَمَل “the deed” can be translated in English as “deeds”. So أَيُّ ٱلْعَمَلِ means “which one from the generic type ‘deeds’” or simply “which deed”. Examples:\nأَيُّ الْعَمَلِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ؟ \n“Which deed is most beloved to Allāh?”الأدب المفرد :1\nأَيُّ الدُّعَاءِ أَفْضَلُ \n“Which supplication is best?”الأدب المفرد :637\nأَيُّ الذَّنْبِ أَعْظَمُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ \n“Which deed is most enormous in the sight of Allāh?”صحيح البخاري :4477\n\n\n37.3.2 أَيّ with a indefinite base noun\nWhen the base noun of أَيّ is a indefinite noun, the annexation has the meaning “which” without “of”. For example,\nأَيَّ شَىْءٍ كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ \n“Which thing would you do?”سنن ابن ماجه :2606\nأَيَّ شَىْءٍ نَشْتَهِي \n“What thing shall we desire?”صحيح مسلم :1887\nأَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ \n“Which night is the night of Decree”جامع الترمذي :3513\nIf the base noun is a dual or plural indefinite then then inquiry is about the complete number, not just one of them. For example:\nأَيُّ رِجَالٍ؟ \n“Which men?”Wright 2/220A\nأَيُّ رَجُلَيْنِ؟ \n“Which two men?”Wright 2/220A\n\n\n37.3.3 Matching the rest of the question sentence with أَيّ\nأَيّ itself, like مَا and مَنْ, is singular masculine. For the purpose of matching the rest of the question sentence with أَيّ, either it can match the singular masculine to match with the word أَيّ, or it can match the gender and number of what أَيّ refers to. For example,\nأَيُّ أَزْوَاجِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم اسْتَعَاذَتْ مِنْهُ \nWhich of the wives of the Prophet sought refuge (fwith Allāh) from him?\n(اسْتَعَاذَتْ is a feminine verb to match the feminine “wife”.)صحيح البخاري :5254\nفَأَيُّ نِسَاءِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ أَحْظَى عِنْدَهُ مِنِّي \n“So which of the women of the Prophet was dearer to him than I?”\n(كَانَ is a masculine verb to match masculine أَيّ.)صحيح مسلم :1423\n\n\n37.3.4 أَيّ standalone without a base noun\nOccasionally, أَيّ is used without a base noun. It is then, technically, indefininte. However, the meaning of an annexation is still implicit. This may be when أَيّ has already been used once with an an annexation, and subsequent uses of أَيّ are restricted to the previously mentioned annexation. For example,\nأَيُّ الْعَمَلِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ؟ قَالَ الصَّلاَةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا، قُلْتُ ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟ \n“‘Which deed is most beloved to Allāh?’ He replied, ‘Prayer at its proper time.’ I said, ‘Then which?’”الأدب المفرد :1\nSee also section … below, where أَيّ is used standalone in a response.\n\n\n37.3.5 أَيّ annexed to multiple base nouns\nOne أَيّ may be annexed to multiple base nouns separated by وَ “and”. For example,\nأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْفَاكِهَةِ وَزِرَاعَةِ ٱلْقُطْنِ أَرْبَحُ؟ \n“Which one of the agriculture of fruit, and the agriculture of cotton is more profitable?”النحو الوافي 3/107\nIn such a case, it is optional to have one أَيّ or to repeat it. So we could also say, for the same meaning:\nأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْفَاكِهَةِ وَأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْقُطْنِ أَرْبَحُ؟\nHowever, if one of the base nouns is an attached pronoun  then repeating أَيّ is mandatory.3 Example:\nأَيِّي وَأَيُّكَ أَعْلَمُ؟\n“Which one of you and me is more knowledgeable?”\nأَيِّي وَأَيُّكَ is equivalent to أَيُّنَا but it spells out the two options to choose from.",

    "section": "37.6 Differentiating question words from their other functions",
    "text": "37.6 Differentiating question words from their other functions\nMany of the question words (أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc.) also have other functions. For example, in chapter @ref(the-connected-nouns) we learned that مَنْ, مَا, and أَيّ are also connected nouns. Many of the question nouns can also be used as conditional nouns that we will study in chapter @ref(…), if Allāh wills.\nIn this section, we will discuss briefly how to determine when words like أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc. are question words, and when they could have one of their other functions.\nThe basic principle regarding a question sentence is that it is to be treated as one unit. A word from within a question sentence is not, individually, affected by anything outside the question. Let’s try to understand this using an example.\nConsider the following sentence:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ\nʾisʾal ʾayyuhum qām\n“Ask: ‘Which of them stood?’”\nThe speaker is commanding the addressed person to ask a group of people the question: “Which of them stood”.\nThe question sentence is أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ ʾayyuhum qām “Which of them stood”. This entire sentence is considered the direct doee of the verb of command ٱسْأَلْ “ask!”. The question noun أَيُّ ʾayyu is in the u-state because it is the subject of the question sentence. It does not become أَيَّ ʾayya in the a-state because it is not, by itself, the direct doee of ٱسْأَلْ. Rather, as we have just stated, the entire question sentence is the direct doee. But because the direct doee is a sentence, and not an individual word, it does not indicate its state using, for example, an fat·ḥah ◌َ.\nNow, let’s modify the example. Consider now this sentence:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيَّهُمْ قَامَ\nʾisʾal ʾayyahum qām\nAsk the one of them who stood!\nNow, the noun أَيَّ is in the a-state because it (individually) is the direct doee of the verb of command ٱسْأَلْ. The speaker is now commanding the addressed person to ask (something) of only the person who stood, out of a group of people. The rest of the people are not to be asked. Because the noun أَيَّ is individually affected by the preceding verb ٱسْأَلْ it is now not a question noun, and must be one of the other functions that the word أَيّ can have. As a matter of fact, it is here a connected noun, and the sentence following it: قَامَ “he stood” is its connecting sentence.\nThe other noteworthy point regarding questions (besides their being considered one unit) is that they may only be preceded either by a verb of knowledge, (like عَلِمَ, دَرىٰ, etc.) or by an expression indicating that the question is being quoted. We have already seen an example of the question being quoted in the example:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ\n“Ask: ‘Which of them stood?’”\nAn example of a question being preceded by a verb of knowledge is:\nمَا عَلِمْتُ أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ\nI don’t know whether he went or stayed.\nHere the question sentence is: أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ “Did he go or did he stay?”\nBy the way, a question sentence may be part of a bigger question as well. For example:\nأَتَدْرِي أَيُّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟\nʾatadrī ʾayyuhum fi -ddār\nDo you know: which of them is in the house?\nNote now the subtle difference in meaning if we change the state of أَيّ in the above example from the u-state to the a-state:\nأَتَدْرِي أَيَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟\nʾatadrī ʾayyahum fi -ddār\nDo you know the one of them who is in the house?\nWhen أَيّ was in the u-state it was a question noun. And the speaker was asking the addressed person if he could figure out who, from among the group of people, was in the house.\nWhen أَيّ is in the a-state it is now a connected noun. The connecting sentence’s refer-back pronoun is omitted (as is permissible in this case, see section @ref(…)). With the refer-back pronoun restored, the sentence is أَتَدْرِي أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟ And the speaker is asking the addressed person if he is familiar with the person who is in the house. Now he is not asking the addressed person to identify him, but rather if knows him as a person.\nThis difference is apparent with أَيّ because it is a flexible noun whose state is indicated by the vowel mark at its end. The same occurs in the other question nouns that are also connected nouns: مَا, and مَنْ but it won’t often be as apparent because they are rigid nouns.\nAs a final note, sometimes, one of the words like أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc. may be preceded by parts of a sentence that are neither quoting, nor a verb of knowledge. Here we can be sure that the word is not a question word and must be one of its other functions. However, it still may not be easy to figure out what that other function is. Nevertheless, the meaning of the sentence can still usually be gleaned. For example:\nفَلْتَدْخُلْ مِنْ أَيِّ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ شَاءَتْ\n“then let her enter from whichever of the doors of paradise she wishes.”[^question-vs-other-functions]",

In this word, the yāʾ ي joins to the tāʾ marbūṭah ة.\nAs a special case, when unseated hamza comes between joined lām and alif (لا), then it is positioned between them thus: لءا. (In most cases, this is replaced with لآ as we will explain in the next point below.) And this is different from hamzah on the alif following the lām: لأ.\nWhen unseated hamzah is followed by an alif: ءا, the combination of hamzah and alif is usually written as آ as a convention. Examples: آمَنَ ʾāmana, ظَمْآن ḍ͡hamʾān, شَنَآن s͡hanaʾān. However, when the alif is a suffix or part of a suffix, or the hamzah is doubled, or there is an alif before the hamzah then we will write ءا, not آ. Examples: شَيْءَانِ s͡hayʾāni, سَءَّال saʾʾāl, قِرَاءَات qirāʾāt.\nWhen hamzah is seated on alif, if it has an kasrah, it is written below the alif: إِ.

    "text": "A.2 Rules for determining the seat of hamzah\n\nA.2.1 Without prefixes and suffixes\nWe will first learn how to determine the seat of hamzah for a word without any prefix or suffix.\nHamzah can occur in three positions in a word:\n\nAt the beginning of the word\nIn the middle of the word\nAt the end of the word\n\nWe will treat each of these positions below.\n\nA.2.1.1 At the beginning of the word\nWhen hamzah occurs in the beginning of a word, then:\n\nIf the hamzah carries a long-ā vowel, it is written unseated followed by an alif and written as آ, for example آمَنَ ʾāmana.\nIf the hamzah carries any other vowel, it is written seated on an alif, and is marked with the appropriated vowel mark, for example أَسْلَمَ ʾaslama, أُرِيدُ ʾurīdu, إِسْلَام ʾislām, إِيمَان ʾīmān, أُوخِذَ ʾūk͡hid͡ha.\n\n\n\nA.2.1.2 In the middle of the word\n\nArabic has three short vowels, three long vowels, two semi-vowels, and a zero-vowel indicated by a sukūn ◌ْ. Each of these has an order of precedence and a hamzah seat, that we have shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nPrecedence\nVowel\nSeated hamzah\n\n\n\n\n1.\nī/ay\nء\n\n\n2.\ni\nئ\n\n\n3.\nū/aw\nء\n\n\n4.\nu\nؤ\n\n\n5.\nā\nء\n\n\n6.\na\nأ\n\n\n7.\n◌ْ\nء\n\n\n\nMain rule: Disregard any s͡haddah ◌ّ. Consider the vowel on the consonant before the hamzah and the vowel on the hamzah itself. Determine which of the two vowels wins by being higher in precedence in the above table. The winning vowel’s seat will be the seat of the hamzah.\nException: If the vowel ā wins, but it is written not as an alif but as a ىٰ, then the hamzah will be seated on an alif.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nVowel before hamzah\nVowel on hamzah\nWinning vowel\nSeated hamzah\n\n\n\n\n هَيْءَة hayʾah\nay\na\nay\nء\n\n\n خَطِيءَة k͡haṭīʾah\nī\na\nī\nء\n\n\n اسْتِيءَاس ʾistīʾās\nī\na\nī\nء (Exception: ءَا is not written as آ when the preceding vowel is ī.)\n\n\n تَوْءَم tawʾam\naw\na\naw\nء\n\n\n سَوْءَة sawʾah\naw\na\naw\nء\n\n\n مَوْئِل mawʾil\naw\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n سَائِل sāʾil\nā\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n تَسَاؤُل tasāʾul\nā\nu\nu\nؤ\n\n\n تَسَاءَلَ tasāʾala\nā\na\nā\nء\n\n\n قِرَاءَات qirāʾāt\nā\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n نُوآنٌ nūʾānun\nū\nā\nū\nء\n\n\n مَسْءُول masʾūl\n◌ْ\nū\nū\nء\n\n\n تَرْءِيس tarʾīs\n◌ْ\nī\nī\nء\n\n\n مِرْآة mirʾāh\n◌ْ\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n ظَمْآن ḍ͡hamʾān\n◌ْ\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n مَسْأَلَة masʾalah\n◌ْ\na\na\nأ\n\n\n الْمَرْأَة almarʾah\n◌ْ\na\na\nأ\n\n\n أَسْئِلَة ʾasʾilah\n◌ْ\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n أَفْئِدَة ʾafʾidah\n◌ْ\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n بِئْسَ biʾsa\ni\n◌ْ\ni\nئ\n\n\n سُؤْل suʾl\nu\n◌ْ\nu\nؤ\n\n\n كَأْس kaʾs\na\n◌ْ\na\nأ\n\n\n سُئِلَ suʾila\nu\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n يَئِسَ yaʾisa\na\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n مُطْمَئِنّ muṭmaʾinn\na\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n سُؤَال suʾāl\nu\nā\nu\nؤ\n\n\n رَءِيس raʾīs\na\nī\nī\nء\n\n\n رُءُوس ruʾūs\nu\nū\nū\nء\n\n\n شُءُون s͡huʾūn\nu\nū\nū\nء\n\n\n رَءُوف raʾūf\na\nū\nū\nء\n\n\n لُؤَيّ luʾayy\nu\na\nu\nؤ\n\n\n شَنَآن s͡hanaʾān\na\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n سَأَلَ saʾala\na\na\na\nأ\n\n\n رَأَّسَ raʾʾasa\na\na\na\nأ\n\n\n سَيِّئَة sayyiʾah\ni\na\ni\nئ\n\n\n يُرَئِّسُ yuraʾʾisu\na\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n رُئِّسَ ruʾʾisa\nu\ni\ni\nئ\n\n\n تَفَؤُّل tafaʾʾul\na\nu\nu\nؤ\n\n\n سَءَّال saʾʾāl\na\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n لَءَّال laʾʾāl\na\nā\nā\nء\n\n\n رَأَىٰ raʾā\na\nā\nā\nأ (using exception)\n\n\n\n\n\nA.2.1.3 At the end of the word\nWhen hamzah occurs at the end of a word, disregard the vowel on hamzah itself, and consider only the vowel on preceding consonant.

In this case the hamzah will again be unseated. Example تَبَوُّءُ tabawwuʾu.\nNote also that مُبْتَدَإِ mubtadaʾi can be written with the hamzah below the alif because of the kasrah on the hamzah. But it is also common to write it as مُبْتَدَأ mubtadaʾ, especially when the hamzah is unvoweled.\n\n\n\nA.2.2 With prefixes and suffixes\n\nA.2.2.1 Prefixes\nIf hamzah is in the beginning of a word, adding a prefix to the word will not alter the writing of the hamzah. Hamzah will continue to be seated on an alif.

Examples:\n\n جُزْءَانِ juzʾāni\n\n عِبْءَانِ ɛibʾāni\n\n عِبْءَيْنِ ɛibʾayni\n\n بُطْءَهُ buṭʾahu\n\n بُطْءُهُ buṭʾuhu\n\n بُطْءِهِ buṭʾihi\n\n\n\n(انِ, يْنِ, هُ, and هِ are suffixes.) Note that the combination ءا is not written as آ when the alif is part of the suffix.\n\n\n\nA.2.3 tanwīn on final hamzah\ntanwīn on final hamzah does not affect the writing of the hamzah except in the case of a tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً. When writing a tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً on a hamzah at the end of a word:\n\nIf there is an alif before a unseated hamzah اء, then we don’t add a silent alif when writing the tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً. For example دَاء becomes دَاءً dāʾan, not دَاءًا.\nOtherwise, we add the silent alif after the hamzah so that the hamzah is now in the middle of the word with a suffix alif after it. We now pretend that the hamzah has an fat·ḥah and that the alif after it is a long-ā vowel. Then we go through the rules for writing hamzah in the middle of a word (given above) to determine how hamzah will be written. We then write the tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً on the hamzah. Examples:\n\n\n مُبْتَدَأ becomes مُبْتَدَأٌ، مُبْتَدَءًا، مُبْتَدَإٍ\n مَلْجَأ becomes مَلْجَأٌ، مَلْجَءًا، مَلْجَإٍ\n جُزْء becomes جُزْءٌ، جُزْءًا، جُزْءٍ\n شَيْء becomes شَيْءٌ، شَيْءًا، شَيْءٍ\n سَيِّئ becomes سَيِّئٌ, سَيِّئًا, سَيِّئٍ\n\n\n\nA.2.4 Variants\nThere are some historical and regional variants to the above rules. The main one is when the letter before hamzah has a sukūn, the hamzah is generally written unseated. So with this variant, we write:\n\n مَسْءَلَة instead of مَسْأَلَة\n\nHowever, this rule appears to be not consistently followed. For example, nas͡hʾah is generally always written نَشْأَة never نَشْءَة.\n\nAnother variant is that when word final hamzah has an kasrah and is followed by a suffix starting with ū, then the hamzah is written unseated instead of as ئ. Examples:\n\n مُتَّكِءُون muttakiʾūn instead of مُتَّكِئُون\n يُطْفِءُوا yuṭfiʾū instead of يُطْفِئُوا\n مُسْتَهْزِءُون mustahziʾūn instead of مُسْتَهْزِئُون\n مُنْشِءُون muns͡hiʾūn instead of مُنْشِئُون\n يُضَاهِءُونَ yuḍāhiʾūna instead of يُضَاهِئُونَ\n مُرْجِءُون murjiʾūn instead of مُرْجِئُون\n مُرْجِءُون murjiʾūn instead of مُرْجِئُون\n رَئِيس raʾīs instead of رَءِيس\n\nExcepted from this variant are deficient words like:\n\n فِئُون fiʾūn\n\n مِئُون miʾūn\n\nAnother, more modern, variant is to modify the precedence rule of vowels. According to this modern variant, the vowel before hamzah is compared with the shortened vowel on the hamzah. This can result in some changes in the hamzah seat. For example:\n\n مَسْؤُول masʾūl instead of مَسْءُول\n رُؤُوس ruʾūs instead of رُءُوس\n ٱقْرَؤُوا iqraʾū instead of ٱقْرَءُوا\n\nExcepted from this variant is the combination aʾā which will continue to be written as ـَءَا or ـَآ. For example: شَنَآن, مُرْجَءَات.",

    "text": "A.3 Why so complicated?\nHamzah was originally not pronounced everywhere in some Classical Arabic dialects. For speakers of these dialects, when hamzah would occur in the middle of a word, they would replace it with an a, u, or i vowel. So they would adjust their pronunciation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProununciation with hamzah\nProununciation without hamzah\n\n\n\n\nهَيْءَة hayʾah\nهَيَّة hayyah\n\n\nخَطِيءَة k͡haṭīʾah\nخَطِيَّة k͡haṭiyyah\n\n\nتَوْءَم tawʾam\nتَوَّم tawwam\n\n\nتَسَاؤُل tasāʾul\nتَسَاوُل tasāwul\n\n\nبِئْسَ biʾsa\nبِيسَ bīsa\n\n\nسُؤْل suʾl\nسُول sūl\n\n\nكَأْس kaʾs\nكَاس kās\n\n\n\nWhen the Classical Standard Arabic variety emerged, then, for reasons that are beyond the scope of this text, the pronunciation with hamzah and the consonantal spelling without hamzah became standardized. So ء is now added as a pronunciation mark on top of the various seats that would instead have been dialectally pronounced without hamzah.",

In most fonts, the hamzah character (Unicode u+0621) will break the joining between the two letters surrounding it, and the output will be rendered incorrectly: خَطِيءَة k͡haṭīʾah.\nTwo typefaces which allow for the correct typesetting are\n\nAmiri from Alif Type (amirifont.org)\nNaskh™ from DecoType (decotype.com)\n\nWe have used the Amiri font for typesetting this appendix chapter.\nFor most other fonts, an unseated hamzah between two joined letters would have to be approximated in one of two ways:\n\nHamzah superscript on a taṭwīl character: ـٔ. Example: خَطِيـَٔة. The Unicode input sequence is:\nu+0640 arabic tatweel\nu+0654 arabic hamza above\nThis is a more accurate approximation, but some fonts may not position the hamzah correctly on the taṭwīl, or position vowel marks on the superscript hamzah correctly.\nHamzah seated on yāʾ: ئ. Example: خَطِيئَة. This is a reprehensible, yet more prevalent, and better supported, approximation.\n\nBeware, though, that neither of these approximations would allow for the correct rendering of a complex (but thankfully rare) word like لَءَّال laʾʾāl “pearl seller”, where the hamzah is not allowed to disturb the lām-alif ligature لا.",

    "text": "C.1 “There is a …” sentences.\nIn English the plain existence of an indefinite subject is expressed using the word “there”. For example:\nThe word “there” in these examples does not indicate a specific place. Rather it signifies the existence of the subject of the sentence. This use of “there” is called the existential “there”.\nExpressing such sentences in Arabic can sometimes be tricky. There is a modern tendency to use the ḍ͡harf makan هُنَاكَ and the majhūl verb يُوجَدُ.  So one might find:\nSometimes in place of هُنَاكَ, its synonym, ثَمَّةَ is used. These usages of هُنَاكَ, ثَمَّةَ, and يُوجَدُ are foreign to Arabic and should generally be avoided.\nIn Classical Arabic, expressing such sentences falls under the category of sentences with indefinite subjects. We have discussed this topic in chapter @ref(chap-indef-subjects).\nThere are various strategies for expressing such sentences:",

    "text": "“There is a gloom in the house”\n“There is a type of anger which is liked and [there is] a type of anger which is disliked.\n“There are reasons.”\n“There is a god.”\n“Is there food?”\n“Yes, there is food”\n\n\n\n\n\nهُنَاكَ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ. or\nيُوجَدُ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ.\nهناك غضب يستحب وهناك غصب يكره. or\nيوجد غضب يستحب ويوجد غصب يكره.\nهُناك أسباب. or\nتُوجَدُ أسباب.\n\nهناك إله. or\nيوجد إله.\nهَل هناك طعام؟ or\nهل يوجد طعام؟\nنَعَمْ هناك طعام. or\nنَعَمْ يوجد طعام.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.1.1 Using or manufacturing scope\nIf, for example, there is a jārr wa-majrūr, or other s͡hibh jumlah then it can readily be used as a k͡habar that precedes the mubtadaʾ. For example:\nفِي ٱلْبَيتِ حَزَنٌ.\n“In the house is gloom.”\nSometimes, a jārr wa-majrūr, or other s͡hibh jumlah is not original, but can readily be manufactured. For example, in the sentence, “There are reasons.” the reasons must be for something, and that something can be used as a k͡habar:\nلِلْوَضْعِ أَسْبَابٌ.\n“For the situation, are reasons.”\n\n\nC.1.2 Using or manufacturing an introductory sentence\nSimilarly, a introductory sentence or s͡hibh jumlah can be manufactured to pave the way for the main sentence. For example:\nالغَضَبُ غَضَبَانِ: غَضَبٌ مُسْتَحَبٌّ وَغَضَبٌ مَكْرُوهٌ.\n“Anger is (actually) two angers: an anger that is liked, and an anger that is disliked.”\nمَنَ ٱلْغَضَبِ مَا يٌسْتَحَبُّ وَمَا يٌكْرَهُ.\n“From anger is that which is liked, that which is disliked.”\n\nمِنَ الْغَيْرَةِ مَا يُحِبُّ اللَّهُ وَمِنْهَا مَا يَكْرَهُ اللَّهُ [سنن ابن ماجه :9]\n\n\n\nC.1.3 Using an interjection\nSometimes it hard to come up with any of the above solutions, as in the sentence: “There is a god.” Such sentences, if they are able to be converted to an interjection, may be expressed with the subject itself as a one word sentence1:\nإِلَـٰهٌ!\n“[There is] a god!”\nConsider also this example:\n\nسَأَلْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم هَلْ رَأَيْتَ رَبَّكَ قَالَ نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاهُ [صحيح مسلم :178]\n\nThe statement of the Prophet ﷺ نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاهُ has been explained by ابن تيمية with the following wording:\n\nكَانَ ثَمَّ نُورٌ ، أَوْ حَالَ دُونَ رُؤْيَتِهَ نُورٌ فَأَنَّىٰ أَرَاهُ. 2\n“There was light, or light came between [my] seeing Him, so how could I see Him?”\n\nThis solution should only be considered if the sentence makes sense as an interjection, and can not be used as a blanket solution. For example, in the exchange:\n“Is there food?”\n“Yes, there is food.”\nOne way to express this in Arabic is:\nهَلْ مِنْ طَعَامٍ؟\nنَعَمْ، عِنْدَنَا طَعَامٌ.\n\n\nC.1.4 Negative and past existential sentences\nEnglish also uses the word “there” with this existential meaning for sentences like:\n\n“There was a king.”\n“There is no hope.”\n\nThese sentences can be expressed in Arabuc without indefinite subjects. For example:\n\nكَانَ مَلِكٌ.\nThis uses the self-sufficient كَانَ. (See section @ref(self-sufficient-kaana).)\nلَا أَمَلَ.\nThis uses the nāfiyah lil-jins لَا. (See section @ref(la-nafiyah-lil-jins).)\n\n\n\nC.1.5 Legitimate use of هُنَاكَ and يُوجَدُ\nIf, of course, a place is intended by “there” then there is no problem using هُنَاكَ or its synonyms. For example:\nأَثَمَّ زَيْدٌ؟\n“Is Zayd there?”\nSimilarly, يُوجَدُ may be used with no problem if the meaning “is (to be) found” is intended. For example:\nمن قتل معاهدا لم يرح رائحة الجنة، وإن ريحها توجد من مسيرة أربعين عاماً\n\n\nC.1.6 Technical and scientific use of يوجَد\nOur above directive to avoid the use of يوجد to mean “there is” holds for normal sentences. Sometimes, however, a more technical meaning of “exists” is intended, especially in the language of science.  In this case, يوجد and its ism mafɛūl موجود may be used when needing to discuss the existence of something in a scientific text. But such usage should be restricted to its domain, and should not, ideally, spill over to normal sentences, where a simple “there is” is intended.\nWhile this concession can be granted to يوجد, we find no such justifying circumstance for using هناك existentially.",

    "text": "C.5 “What about …”\nAvoid مَاذَا عَنْ when asking “What about someone/something?”\nInstead use مَا بَالُ.\nFor example:\nحَتَّى إِذَا فَرَغَ مَشَيْتُ، فَقُلْتُ مَا بَالُ الْعَظْمِ وَالرَّوْثَةِ\nbukhari:3860\nإِذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاَهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ “. قِيلَ فَهَذَا الْقَاتِلُ، فَمَا بَالُ الْمَقْتُولِ\nbukhari:7083\nعَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّهَا قَالَتْ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ مَا الشَّىْءُ الَّذِي لاَ يَحِلُّ مَنْعُهُ قَالَ الْمَاءُ وَالْمِلْحُ وَالنَّارُ ” . قَالَتْ قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ هَذَا الْمَاءُ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاهُ فَمَا بَالُ الْمِلْحِ وَالنَّارِ\nibnmajah:2474\nWhen the question “What about …?” is asked as a follow-up to a previous statement then the asked about person/thing can be asked by itself in a single word. For example:\nعَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّهُ نَهَى أَنْ يَشْرَبَ الرَّجُلُ قَائِمًا . قَتَادَةُ فَقُلْنَا فَالأَكْلُ فَقَالَ ذَاكَ أَشَرُّ أَوْ أَخْبَثُة “what about eating?” muslim:2024b\nقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لِلْمُتَلاَعِنَيْنِ ” حِسَابُكُمَا عَلَى اللَّهِ أَحَدُكُمَا كَاذِبٌ لاَ سَبِيلَ لَكَ عَلَيْهَا ” . قَالَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ مَالِي\n“What about my wealth?” abudawud:2257",

    "text": "C.6 To make someone do something\nIn order to express the meaning: to make someone do something, we have a few options:\n\nTo use a causative verb, like form 4, if one is available with this meaning. For example:\n\nأَدْخَلْتُهُ ٱلدَّارَ [المقتضب للمبرد 2/104]\n\nTo use the expression حَمَلَهُ عَلَى أَنْ يَفْعَلَ. For example\n\nوَقَالُوا شَيَّأْتُهُ ; أَيْ حَمَلْتُهُ عَلَى أَنْ يَشَاءَ [التبيان في إعراب القرآن للعكبري 1/37]\nوَأَعْجَلْتُهُ بِالْأَلِفِ حَمَلْتُهُ عَلَى أَنْ يَعْجَلَ [المصباح المنير للفيومي root عجل]\n\nThis expressions is especially common in questions like “What made you …?” For example:\n\nمَا حَمَلَكَ عَلَى مَا صَنَعْتَ [سنن أبي داود :2221]\n\nTo use the verb جَعَلَ. For example:\n\nجَعَلْتُهُ يَدْخُلَهَا [المقتضب للمبرد 2/104]",
