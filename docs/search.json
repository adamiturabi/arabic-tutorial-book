    "title": "A Grammar of Standard Classical Arabic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Work in progress.\n\nNot ready for study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary texts of Islām (the Qurʾān and the Ḥadīt͡h) are in Arabic. So too is much of its scholarly literature. However, there are many Muslims for whom Arabic is not a native language, yet who are familiar enough with English to study textbooks written in this language. The goal of this book is to help them learn Arabic at a beginner’s level so that, together with a study of the appropriate expositional texts, they are one step closer to understanding the primary texts in their original language. We hope that this will, if Allāh wills, make them feel more connected to the primary texts and their teachings. Furthermore, they can be empowered to study the vast body of Arabic Islāmic literature.\n\nRegarding the title of this book: the Arab grammarians were describing the Arabic language, drawing upon a corpus that included transmitted texts and the dialectal speech of informants. We term the language of this corpus to be Classical Arabic because of its considerable volume and its agreed upon significance and eloquence. In the process of describing the dialectal variation of Classical Arabic, a standard variety emerged and gained prevalence. Thenceforth, virtually all texts that were composed attempted to conform to the grammar of this standard. And it is the grammar of this Standard Classical Arabic (sca) that is the subject of this work.\nWhile the grammar that we cover in this book is of sca, the vocabulary may include legitimate post-classical words and meanings. But we stop short of dealing with Modern Standard Arabic (msa). Because the preponderance of its modern vocabulary would detract from the main focus of this book. And also because Western grammar works which focus on msa tend to use modern texts as a corpus to re-describe and re-codify its grammar. Which can put the grammar of this definition of msa at odds with the grammar of sca.\n\nThis book is a learning or teaching grammar, as opposed to being strictly a reference grammar. Therefore, generally, topics are covered, and examples are given, in a manner that assumes an understanding of only preceding content. We have, however, generally tried to origanize content coherently for convenient reference during learning.\nWe have also aimed to make this a self-instruction textbook so that a diligent student should, if Allāh wills, be able to study it independently. The target learner is someone who has not been exposed to grammatical terminology beyond a grade school level. While terminology is necessary for a rigorous non-immersive learning of language, we have tried to steer away from Latin-based terms like accusative, jussive, etc. Such terms, when first encountered by an uninitiated learner, may deter him from proceeding further. So we have in some places translated the meaning of Arabic grammar terms to English. In other places, we have used established English grammar terms where the terms are basic enough. We have even, in places, invented terms where we deemed appropriate. We have also used some grammatical terminology from Arabic directly, usually in cases where our target learner may have already been exposed to them from Qurʾān recitation rules, or where the term is complex enough that creating a term specifically in English wouldn’t make it any simpler. The drawback to this non-standard approach, however, is that the student may not be able to immediately relate the terminology he has learned in this book to established terminology in other grammar textbooks. To remedy this to some extent, we provide a glossary which maps the grammatical terminology used in this book to other, established, Latin-based and Arabic-based counterparts.\nIt may also be appropriate to inform the reader that we chose to present a subset, and sometimes a simplified version, of Arabic grammar. As such, the grammar presented here may not be entirely consistent with the comprehensive and harmonious framework developed by the Arab grammarians. We chose this approach because we felt that exposing the beginner to complex grammatical details at this stage would be more of a hindrance than a help in learning the language.\n\n\nTechnical matters\n\nThis book is produced using the Quarto authoring and publishing framework and set in the Charis, Vazirmatn, and Amiri typefaces.\nUnless otherwise indicated, translations from the Qurʾān are by Ṣaḥeeḥ International™, sourced from https://quran.com.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the numbering of Ḥadīt͡h is that used by https://sunnah.com.\nThe page numbers for citations may vary across different editions and publishers. We have attempted to specify the edition that we are using in the references.\n\nthe authors",

    "text": "1.1 History of Arabic\nAll praises are due to Allāh. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allāh from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds. Whomever Allāh guides, no one can mislead. Whomever Allāh leads astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except Allāh. I also bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and messenger.\nMay the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon the Prophet Muḥammad, his family, his companions, and those who followed them with good conduct.\nAllāh, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the Qurʾān, some fourteen and a half centuries ago, to the Prophet Muḥammad, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Qurʾān is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. Also, composed in this Arabic language, was a vast body of poetry that the Arabs would consider eloquent and worth transmitting. We will call the Arabic of this pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic era as Classical Arabic. The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken by the different tribes and in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula.\nAll languages change naturally over time. For example, English has changed to such a degree that the Old English language spoken 1400 years ago would be unintelligible to us today. So too did the Classical Arabic dialects begin to change. But as part of preserving His religion, Allāh preserved the Arabic language as well. This was by means of the efforts of scholars who recorded the Classical Arabic language of the time of the revelation.\nIn the process of preserving Classical Arabic, one particular variety became standardized and gained prevalence as a literary language over the other dialects of the Arabic of the early-Islāmic period. We will call this variety Standard Classical Arabic (sca).\nsca became the language of religious scholarship, science, and literature in the Islāmic world. As scholars developed new branches of religious and secular sciences, new terms and meanings were added (which are termed post-classical). A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages and Arabicized, as needed by the different scientific disciplines. Classical Arabic itself had a few Arabicized foreign borrowings from neighboring languages.\nWhile sca was preserved and used for literary purposes, the vernacular language that was spoken by Arabs in their day-to-day lives continued to change over time and in the different regions where Arabic was spoken. And so, there began to exist two very distinct types of Arabic: the preserved sca which is taught by formal education and which is primarily a written language, and the vernacular Arabic dialects which Arabs learn as their mother tongue and which are primarily only spoken and not written.\nIn modern times, many new words and meanings were added to sca, often via translation from Western languages, to keep up with technological advancements and modern media.  This modern development of sca is called Modern Standard Arabic (msa).\nThe figure below depicts the historical development of sca",

    "section": "1.2 What defines sca",
    "text": "1.2 What defines sca\n\nIt may be appropriate to say a few words about what defines sca proper. When the Arab grammarians first began recording and describing Classical Arabic, the regular, day-to-day, speech of many people had already begun to deviate from Classical Arabic. So the grammarians would seek out and record samples of speech and texts from only authoritative sources. And they had criteria for determining what constituted an authority in the language. One such criterion was that the text sample be native Classical Arabic speech.\nBy the time sca emerged as a standard, Classical Arabic itself had more or less ceased to be a native language. All literary output produced in sca was then an attempt to conform to the standard. So, even though proficiency in sca was generally pretty high, texts written in sca are not generally, themselves, definitive of sca.1\nAs a new learner, this exactitude is largely academic. Excepting the Qurʾān, which is inimitable, you may feel free to emulate the writing of good writers of sca.",

    "text": "1.3 Spoken sca\nAs we have mentioned above sca is primarily a written language. As a spoken language, sca is, today, heard almost only in religious and formal settings.\nWe will learn in this book, if Allāh wills, that there are very exact rules for properly pronuncing and pausing in sca.\nPractically, however, most native Arabic speakers today rarely adhere to these rules exactly in extemporaneous speech. Furthermore, speakers may sometimes casually mix in their vernacular dialect within their sca speech. In fact, a strict adherence to all sca grammar and pronunciation rules in informal spoken settings may, today, come across as turgid or pedantic.2",

    "section": "1.4 About this book",
    "text": "1.4 About this book\n\n1.4.1 Scope\nIn this book, we will study the grammar of sca. If Allāh wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the Qurʾān, the Ḥadīt͡h, and Islāmic literature.\nIf your goal is to learn msa, then this book may still be of help because the core language and the grammar are essentially the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on the modern language.\nThis book does not touch at all upon the modern vernacular dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Current status\nThis book is currently a work in progress, and not yet ready for study. \n\n\n1.4.3 Methodology\nWe will start, if Allāh wills, with the Arabic script and present, in each chapter, a new concept of Arabic grammar, together with examples. Though there is none right now, we also plan to give, if Allāh wills, a vocabulary list and exercises for each chapter.\nWe have generally tried to organize content coherently for convenience reference during learning. Sometimes, this can mean that on encountering a new topic, we present it in more detail than is strictly necessary for learning at that stage. Although identifying such material may not be easy for the learner, you may feel free to skim over such material and refer back to it later, as needed.\n\nSome of the sentences we present, both as examples and as chapter exercises, because of their contrived nature, may seem of dubious usefulness to a learner wanting to learn practical usage. Also, when translating examples, we usually steer toward a literal, word-for-word, translation rather than an idiomatic one. This is in order to illustrate the function of each word, and to show a correspondence between the words in the Arabic sentence and the English translation. The resulting English will then often sound awkward, and even sometimes ungrammatical. We request the reader’s patience and indulgence in these and other matters.\n\n\n1.4.4 How to study from this book\n\n1.4.4.1 Exercises\nIn answering the exercises, we strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and write down the answers with pen and paper. We strongly recommend that you resist the tendency to answer the exercises only orally or mentally without writing them down, or look up the answers from the answer key before attempting to write the answer yourself, or look up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them, or proceed to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises. You may also find yourself having to go back a few chapters every once in a while and revising the concepts therein. This is very normal and not a cause for any concern. It may also prove beneficial to re-do the exercises of that chapter when doing so.\n\n\n1.4.4.2 Vocabulary\nKnow that while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a proficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by oneself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts independently. In fact, we would not be too far off to say that grammar, at this stage, is only a tool to help you make sense of the vocabulary that you are acquiring. So strive to achieve a balance between learning grammar and acquiring vovabulary. In appendix @ref(vocabulary-and-reading), we suggest companion reading material, dictionaries, and techniques on acquiring and retaining vocabulary.",

    "section": "2.2 Writing Arabic words",
    "text": "2.2 Writing Arabic words\n\n2.2.1 Letters in different positions\nArabic is written right-to-left, unlike English and most other languages which are written left-to-right. When writing, the letters in a word are generally joined to each other, except for six out of the 28 letters, which join only to the letter preceding them but not to the letter following them. These six partially-joining letters are ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و.\nWhen joining the letters, letters are modified in order to join to the preceding and following letter. The fully-joining letters can be in four positions:\n\nby itself (isolated),\nin the beginning of a group of joined letters,\nin the middle of a group of joined letters,\nin the end of a group of joined letters.\n\nAs we just mentioned, six of the letters (ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و) don’t join to the following letter. So these letters can only occur only in the end of a group of joined letters, or isolated by themselves.\nIn this book we will show a “Simplified Arabic” writing style where, in each of the four positions, the letter maintains its basic shape and is usually only slightly modified to join to the previous and following letter with horizontal lines.\nTo explain the method of modifying the letters when joining them, we will take ب as an example and start with the isolated form:\nIsolated form: ب\nTo modify this into the end form, we simply join a horizontal line to the right of the letter:\nEnd form: ـب.\nTo get the middle form, we take the end form ـب and cut off its tail which is at its left, and replace it with a horizontal line. We also move the dot slightly to get:\nMiddle form: ـبـ\nAnd finally, to get the beginning form, we take the middle form ـبـ and remove the horizontal line at the right:\nBeginning form: بـ\nNow most of the letters follow this common technique but a few of them are modified a little further in each form. These, more complicated, letters are ع، غ، ك، ه، ي and you can study them and the rest of the letters in the table below:\n\n\n\nNo.\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginning\n\n\n\n\n1\nا\nـا\nnone\nnone\n\n\n2\nب\nـب\nـبـ\nبـ\n\n\n3\nت\nـت\nـتـ\nتـ\n\n\n4\nث\nـث\nـثـ\nثـ\n\n\n5\nج\nـج\nـجـ\nجـ\n\n\n6\nح\nـح\nـحـ\nحـ\n\n\n7\nخ\nـخ\nـخـ\nخـ\n\n\n8\nد\nـد\nnone\nnone\n\n\n9\nذ\nـذ\nnone\nnone\n\n\n10\nر\nـر\nnone\nnone\n\n\n11\nز\nـز\nnone\nnone\n\n\n12\nس\nـس\nـسـ\nسـ\n\n\n13\nش\nـش\nـشـ\nشـ\n\n\n14\nص\nـص\nـصـ\nصـ\n\n\n15\nض\nـض\nـضـ\nضـ\n\n\n16\nط\nـط\nـطـ\nطـ\n\n\n17\nظ\nـظ\nـظـ\nظـ\n\n\n18\nع\nـع\nـعـ\nعـ\n\n\n19\nغ\nـغ\nـغـ\nغـ\n\n\n20\nف\nـف\nـفـ\nفـ\n\n\n21\nق\nـق\nـقـ\nقـ\n\n\n22\nك\nـك\nـكـ\nكـ\n\n\n23\nل\nـل\nـلـ\nلـ\n\n\n24\nم\nـم\nـمـ\nمـ\n\n\n25\nن\nـن\nـنـ\nنـ\n\n\n26\nه\nـه\nـهـ\nهـ\n\n\n27\nو\nـو\nnone\nnone\n\n\n28\nي\nـي\nـيـ\nيـ\n\n\n\nYou can see that each letter maintains a basic shape and is modified for each of the four positions.\n\n\n2.2.2 Joining the different forms to make a word\nNotice that when we modified the isolated form to get to the beginning, middle, and end forms, we added a horizontal line to each or both sides. It is this horizontal line which joines to the horizontal line of the neighboring letter.\nAs an example, we would like to join the following letters (starting from the right): م-ع-ش-ر into one word. The first letter is م so we modify it to its beginning form مـ. The next two letters are converted to their middle forms ـعـ، ـشـ. And the last letter ر is converted to its end form ـر. Then we join the horizontal lines together and get مــعــشــر. Usually, when we join letters like this we shorten the horizontal lines so you will generally see the word like this معشر.\nIn this example, we needed the beginning, middle, and end forms of the letters. Isolated forms are used in a word when there is a partially-joining letter present that won’t join to the following letter. The letter after a partially-joining letter will be in its beginning form even though it is in the middle of a word. But if it too is a partially-joining letter, or it is the last letter in the word then it will take its isolated form.\nLet’s take a look at some examples where a group of disjoint letters are joined to form a word:\n\n\n\nDisjoint\nJoined\n\n\n\n\nذ-ل-ك\nذلك\n\n\nا-ح-م-د\nاحمد\n\n\nر-س-و-ل\nرسول\n\n\nو-ز-ي-ر\nوزير\n\n\nر-ا-ز-ق\nرازق\n\n\n\nNotice that in the last example, all the letters were in the isolated form.\n\n2.2.2.1 Simplified and Traditional writing styles\nWe have just shown how letters join to each other with a horizontal line in the Simplified Arabic writing style. Traditional Arabic writing styles are a little more complex than Simplified Arabic: some letters join almost vertically instead of horizontally. But when you get familiar with the Simplified Arabic writing style, if Allah wills, it will not be too difficult for you to read the Traditional Arabic writing style as well.\nHere are some comparisions of letters joining to each other in the Simplified Arabic and Traditional Arabic writing styles.\n\n\n\nDisjoint\nJoined (simplified)\nJoined (traditional)\n\n\n\n\nت-م-ر\nتمر\nتمر\n\n\nا-ل-ح-ج-ج\nالحجج\nالحجج\n\n\nا-ل-م-ا-س\nالماس\nالماس\n\n\nل-م-ح-ة\nلمحة\nلمحة\n\n\nس-ح-ر\nسحر\nسحر\n\n\nب-ح-ي-ر-ة\nبحيرة\nبحيرة\n\n\nف-ي\nفي\nفي\n\n\nب-ت-ث-ب-ي-ت-ت-ي-ن\nبتثبيتتين\nبتثبيتتين\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 ة (closed tāʾ)\nة is a special letter which is merged from two letters of the alphabet. It is a ت but it is written as a ه with two dots above it. ة is pronounced exactly as a ت, except when it is at the end of a sentence in which case it is pronounced as a ه as we’ll explain later, if Allāh wills. ة occurs only at the end of a word so it has only an end form and an isolated form (used when the letter before it is a partially-joining letter).\nExamples:\n\nفاطمة\nشجرة\nفتاة\n\nWe call ة closed tāʾ because it appears as if have taken ت and pressed it until it closed on itself. In contrast, ت is called open tāʾ when needed to differentiate it from ة.\n\n\n2.2.4 Writing hamzah\nWe have mentioned that hamzah was a later addition to the Arabic alphabet and originally it was only sounded and not written. Hamzah can be written in a number of different ways:\n\n“Seated” above (or below) a vowel letter: Hamzah can be written above the vowel letters thus: أ ؤ ئ. When written over ي, the ي will not have any dots, thus: ئـ، ـئـ، ـئ. It may also be written under an alif thus: إ. Examples: أفعال, سؤلك, فئة, إن.\n“Unseated” after a letter. This has two sub cases:\n\nStandalone, after a partially-joining letter or at the end of a word. Examples: تساءل, توءم, عبء.\nInline, in the middle of a word after a fully-joining letter. In this case hamzah is written above the horizontal line that joins the letters. Examples: خطيـٔة, شيـٔا, بريـٔين.\n\n\nIn all cases it is pronounced the same. There are actually a set of fairly complicated rules that determine which of the above ways to choose when writing hamzah. We present these rules in Appendix @ref(hamzarules). We recommend that for now, you memorize the spelling of each word that we present that contains a hamzah. When you are sufficiently advanced, and curious enough, you may refer to Appendix @ref(hamzarules) to learn the full set of rules.\n\n\n2.2.5 Disambiguating letters that look similar\nSome letters are very similar to each other and only differ in their dots or other slight differences. You should take care to distinguish between these letters. We will describe their similarities and differences here.\nThe letters ب, ت, and ث differ only in their dots and are otherwise identical in all positions. ن and ي are similar in initial and middle positions to ب, ت, and ث but differ from them and from each other in isolated and final positions. Compare all five in the table below:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nب\nـب\nـبـ\nبـ\n\n\nت\nـت\nـتـ\nتـ\n\n\nث\nـث\nـثـ\nثـ\n\n\nن\nـن\nـنـ\nنـ\n\n\nي\nـي\nـيـ\nيـ\n\n\n\nThese groups of letters differ too, only in their dots:\n\nج, ح, and خ\nد and ذ\nر and ز\nس and ش\nص and ض\nط and ظ\nع and غ\n\nThe letters ف and ق are similar in the initial and middle positions except for the dots. But in the isolated and final positions, the tail of ق goes lower than that of ف.\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nف\nـف\nـفـ\nفـ\n\n\nق\nـق\nـقـ\nقـ\n\n\n\nBe careful also not to confuse غ and ف in their middle forms. The loop for ف is round where it is triangular and flat-topped for غ (as it is for ع). Compare their middle forms in the table below:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nMiddle\n\n\n\n\nغ\nـغـ\n\n\nف\nـفـ\n\n\n\nThe letters alif ا and lām ل could also be confused for each other. Their forms are shown here again for easy comparison:\n\n\n\nIsolated\nEnd\nMiddle\nBeginnning\n\n\n\n\nا\nـا\nnone\nnone\n\n\nل\nـل\nـلـ\nلـ\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Joining alif after lām\nWhen the letter alif follows lām we would expect them to be joined like this ل+ا → لـا. But actually, they are joined in a special way\nل+ا → لا\nWhen the combination occurs at the end of a group of joined letters, it will appear thus:\nـلا\nExamples:\n\nألا\nالإيمان\nالصلاة",

    "section": "2.3 Vowels and pronunciation marks.",
    "text": "2.3 Vowels and pronunciation marks.\n\n2.3.1 Short Vowels\nArabic has six vowels. There are three short vowels which don’t have letters in the alphabet. Instead they are shown with pronunciation marks:\n\na as the first vowel in English “manipulate”, written with an fat·ḥah ◌َ which is a small diagonal line above the letter like مَـ ma.\ni as in English “bit”, written with an kasrah ◌ِ which is a small diagonal line under the letter like بِـ bi.\nu as in English “put”, written with an ḍammah ◌ُ which is like a tiny و wāw above the letter like فُـ fu.\n\nExamples of words with short vowels:\n\nفَتَحَ fataḥa\nعَمِلَ ɛamila\nقُتِلَ qutila\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Long Vowels\nThere are also three long vowels which are part of the alphabet:\n\nā generally written with an unmarked alif ا and with the preceding letter having an fat·ḥah. Example مَا mā. This vowel is mostly pronounced like the vowel in English “man”. If however, it comes after these letters خ،ر،ص،ض،ط،ظ،غ،ق it is pronounced like English “awe”.\nī like in English “meek” written with an unmarked ي yāʾ with the preceding letter having an kasrah. Example فِي fī.\nū like in English “moon” written with an unmarked و wāw with the preceding letter having an ḍammah. Example ذُو d͡hū.\n\nExamples of words with long and short vowels:\n\nهَارُونُ hārūnu\nكَذَا kad͡hā\nسَرَادِيبَ sarādība\n\n\n2.3.2.1 ā vowel written with a small alif\nSometimes the ā vowel is written as a small alif ◌ٰ, called a “dagger alif”, instead of a regular alif ا. This is done only for a few commonly used words. Here are some examples:\n\nهَـٰذَا hād͡hā\nذَ ٰلِكَ d͡hālika\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 ā vowel written with a yāʾ\nIn some other words, the ā vowel is written with a yāʾ instead of an alif ا. When this happens, we will write the yāʾ without its dots and write a dagger alif ◌ٰ above it, like this ىٰ. Here are some examples:\n\nعَلَىٰ ɛalā\nرَمَىٰ ramā\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Zero-vowel written with a sukūn\nAs we have seen above if an Arabic letter has a vowel after it it will take one of the three pronunciation marks: ◌َ, ◌ِ, ◌ُ. If, however, there is no vowel after the letter we will put a zero-vowel sukūn on it ◌ْ. This mark can generally only occur if there is a short vowel before the letter. Examples:\n\nكَمْ kam\nمُنْذُ mund͡hu\nمِنْهُمْ minhum\nمِنْهَا minhā\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Semi-vowels\nArabic has two short semi-vowels:\n\naw like in English “show”. This is written with a wāw with a sukūn on it and a short a vowel before it. Example لَوْ law.\nay like in English “bait”. This is written with a yāʾ with a sukūn on it and a short a vowel before it. Example كَيْ kay. Examples with short semi-vowels:\n\n\nوَيْحَكَ wayḥaka\nغَيْرُهُ g͡hayruhu\nقَوْلُهُ qawluhu\n\nIt also has two long semi-vowels:\n\nāw like in English “cow”. This is written with a wāw with a sukūn on it and a long ā vowel before it. Example وَاوْ wāw.\nāy like in English “bye”. This is written with a yāʾ with a sukūn on it and a long ā vowel before it. Example شَايْ s͡hāy.\n\nThese long semi-vowels are rare and may only occur at the end of a sentence.\n\n\n2.3.5 Doubled letters\nA word may contain “doubled” letters. This is when the same letter occurs, one after the other; the first letter has a sukūn, and the second letter has a vowel. For example, in the word قَتْتَلَ qattala, the letter ت is doubled. When this occurs, we actually only write the letter once and put a “s͡haddah” ◌ّ on it, like so: قَتَّلَ qattala. When pronouncing this word, stop at and stress the doubled letter qattala and make sure it does not sound like the undoubled letter in قَتَلَ qatala. Examples with doubled letters:\n\nكَبَّرَ kabbara\nحَدُّهُ ḥadduhu\nفَعَّالَ faɛɛāla\nسِكِّينُ sikkīnu. Note that the kasrah is below the s͡haddah but above the letter ك. This is the most common way to write this, although having the kasrah below the letter is also sometimes done as well. (In this case, the s͡haddah will still be above the letter.)\nسَفُّودُ saffūdu\nضَالِّينَ ḍāllīna\nمُزَّمِّلُ muzzammilu\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Tanwīn\nIn the next chapter, we will learn, if Allāh wills, that nouns in Arabic are sometimes pronouned with an extra ن sound at their end. This is called tanwīn. Tanwīn is indicated in writing, not by adding a the letter ن at the end of the word, but by writing the final vowel mark twice, thus:\n\n◌ٌ un, for example كِتَابٌ kitābun.\n◌ً an, for example شَجَرَةً s͡hajaratan.\n◌ٍ in, for example بَيْتٍ baytin.\n\n\nThe tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً has specific spelling rules: Generally, we will generally add a silent alif after it, for example سَالِم becomes سَالِمًا sāliman. This is done for all words except:\n\nIf the word ends with a ة. In this case we don’t add the silent alif. For example, غَاضِبَة becomes غَاضِبَةً g͡hāḍibatan. \nIf the word ends with a ā vowel, whether written with an alif ا or as a yāʾ with dagger alif ىٰ. In this case, the an mark is put on the letter before the alif ا or yāʾ ىٰ and the final vowel letter becomes silent and is not pronounced. For example, مُصْطَفَىٰ becomes مُصْطَفًى muṣṭafan, عَصَا becomes عَصًا ɛaṣan.\nIf the word ends with a hamzah. In this case, we might or might not write a silent alif, depending on the following rules:\n\nIf there is an alif before an unseated hamzah اء, then we don’t add a silent alif. For example دَاء becomes دَاءً dāʾan, not دَاءًا.\nOtherwise, we add a silent alif after the hamzah. However, this may affect the writing of the hamzah, for example مُبْتَدَأ becomes مُبْتَدَءًا mubtadaʾan. This is discussed further in appendix @ref(hamzarules).\n\n\nHere are some examples of tanwīned words:\n\nسَعْدٌ saɛdun \nضَرْبًا ḍarban \nقَاضٍ qāḍin \nسَعَةً saɛatan \nدُعَاءً duɛāʾan \nٱِمْرَءًا imraʾan \nشَيْـًٔا s͡hayʾan \nسُوءًا sūʾan \nغَبَنٌ g͡habanun",

    "section": "2.4 Connecting hamzah",
    "text": "2.4 Connecting hamzah\nSome words in arabic begin with a sukūn. When this occurs a connecting hamzah ٱ (written as a tiny صـ on an alif) is put before it. If this word comes in the beginning of the sentence the connecting alif is pronounced as a hamzah. Otherwise this connecting hamzah is not pronounced and the word is connected to the final vowel of the previous word in pronunciation. In this tutorial we will transcribe the connecting hamzah with a hyphen “-”. Examples of connecting hamzah:\nٱِفْتَحِ ٱلْبَابَ\nʾiftaḥi -lbāba\nٱُنْظُرْ\nʾunḍ͡hur\nIf the previous word does not end with a vowel, then a helper vowel is added. The most common helper vowel is ◌ِ. Example:\nزَيْدٌ ٱلْكَرِيمُ\nzayduni -lkarīmu\nWhen one word ends in a long vowel and the next word begins with a connecting hamzah, the long vowel becomes a short vowel in pronunciation, but in writing the long vowel’s letter is retained. For example:\nأَخَذَ مِنَّا ٱلْكِتَابَ\nʾak͡had͡ha minna -lkitāba\nذُو ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ\nd͡hu -lqarnayni\nفِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nfi -lbayti",

    "section": "2.5 Pronouncing the end of a sentence",
    "text": "2.5 Pronouncing the end of a sentence\nWhen a word is at the end of a sentence and it ends with a long vowel, then the final long vowel is pronounced normally. However, when a word at the end of a sentence does not end with a long vowel, then the final letter’s pronunciation mark is pronounced as a sukūn when vocalizing the sentence. If the final letter is a ة then it is pronounced as a ه hāʾ with a sukūn.\nThis change in pronunciation is only vocal, it does not affect how we write the pronunciation mark. Here we give some examples of words pronounced if they were at the end of a sentence:\nفَتْحُ\nfat·ḥ\nعُقْبَةٌ\nɛuqbah\nوَالِدَايَ\nwālidāy\nوَالِدَيَّ\nwālidayy\nIf however, the final letter’s pronunciation mark is a an mark then it is pronounced as a long-ā vowel. The only exception is if the final letter were ةً, in which case it is then pronounced as a hāʾ with a sukūn هْ. Here are examples of words with an marks pronounced as if they were at the end of a sentence.\nمَفْعُولًا\nmafɛūlā\nسَاجِدًا\nsājidā\nمَرْفُوعَةً\nmarfūɛah\nNote that the above exception is only for ة. If a hamzah with an an mark occurs at the end of a word, then it too will be pronounced as if it had a long-ā vowel after it. Such is the case, whether or not a silent alif is written after the hamzah. Examples:\n\nمُبْتَدَءًا is pronounced mubtadaʾā\nدُعَاءً is pronounced duɛāʾā\n\nSimilarly, if the word has a final yāʾ that represents the long-ā vowel, and the letter before has an an mark, it is pronounced with the long-ā vowel at the end of the sentence. For example:\n\nمُصْطَفًى is pronounced muṣṭafā\n\nExcept in this section, we will usually transcribe Arabic into English letters without modifiying the transcription for the last word in the sentence. This is because the last vowel mark is helpful for us to learn the grammatical function of the word. But when saying the sentence out aloud you should pronounce the ending of the final word as we have just described.\nFor example, the sentence:\nذَهَبَ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ\nwill be transcribed, in the remainder of this book, as:\nd͡hahaba ʾila -lbayti\nbut should be pronounced as\nd͡hahaba ʾila -lbayt",

    "section": "3.2 Definiteness",
    "text": "3.2 Definiteness\nWhen talking about nouns it is necessary to introduce a topic called definiteness.\nA noun is definite when the person or thing it refers to is known. For example, if you say, “The man arrived.” then the usage of the word “the” before “man” tells us that the man is known to us. Therefore the noun “man” is definite in this sentence.\nConversely, if we had said “A man arrived.” then the use of “a” before “man” tells us that the man is unknown to us. Therefore “man” is indefinite in this sentence.\n“The” is called the definite article and “a” is called the indefinite article.\n\n3.2.1 Definite nouns in Arabic\nThe definite article in Arabic is ٱَلْ ʾal. It corresponds to the English definite article “the”. In order to make a noun definite, we attach ٱَلْ ʾal to its beginning.\nFor example, the definite noun “the book” in Arabic is ٱَلْكِتَاب ʾalkitāb.\nٱَلْ ʾal begins with a connecting hamzah; the hamzah will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence. And when it occurs in the beginning of a sentence, the hamzah is pronounced with a ◌َ a-mark.\n\n3.2.1.1 Sun letters and moon letters\nThe noun “man” in Arabic is رَجُل rajul. To make this noun definite, we add ٱَلْ ʾal to the beginning of the word. But instead of becoming ٱَلْرَجُل ʾalrajul the word becomes ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrajul. The ل in ٱَلْ becomes silent and the ر gets doubled. This happens because the first letter ر in the word رَجُل rajul is from a group of letters called “sun letters”. For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when ٱَلْ ʾal is put in the beginning, the ل in ٱَلْ becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.\nThe rest of the letters in the alphabet are called “moon letters” and for words that begin with moon letters, the ل in ٱَلْ does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, ك is a moon letter and we have already seen that كِتَاب kitāb “book” becomes ٱَلْكِتَاب ʾalkitāb “the book”.\nThe sun letters are ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن.\nThe moon letters are ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي.\nThe names “sun letters” and “moon letters” were given because of the Arabic words for “sun” and “moon” respectively. “The sun” in Arabic is ٱَلشَّمْس ʾas͡hs͡hams which begins with ش which causes the ل in ٱَلْ to be silent. “The moon” is ٱَلْقَمَر ʾalqamar which begins with ق which does not cause the ل in ٱَلْ to be silent. Thus ش represents the sun letters and ق represents the moon letters.\nHere are some examples of words that begin with sun letters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoun\nDefinite noun\n\n\n\n\nرَجُل rajul “man”\nٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrajul “the man”\n\n\nتَاجِر tājir “trader”\nٱَلتَّاجِر ʾattājir “the trader”\n\n\nلُعْبَة luɛbah “toy”\nٱَللُّعْبَة ʾalluɛbah “the toy”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 The definite article ٱَلْ ʾal with nouns with an initial connecting hamzah\nIf the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal is with prefixed to nouns that have an initial connecting hamzah, then the ل shall no longer have an sukūn ◌ْ. Instead it shall have an kasrah ◌ِ. Example:\nٱَلِٱبْن\nʾali-bn\n“the son”\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Indefinite nouns in Arabic\nArabic has no indefinite article corresponding to the English indefinite article “a”. In order to make a noun indefinite in Arabic, it is simply written or pronounced without the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal. For example, كِتَاب kitāb “a book”.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Differences in definiteness between Arabic and English\nThe articles “a” and “the” are types of words called determiners. Besides “a” and “the”, English has other determiners like “some”, “this”, “that”, etc. that can make a noun definite or indefinite. For example:\n“This man gave that boy some food.”\nIn the above sentence “man” and “boy” are definite, and “food” is indefinite.\nEnglish can also have definite or indefinite nouns without determiners. The definiteness of the noun is then determined by the meaning of the sentence. Consider, for example, the sentence:\n“Time is valuable.”\nHere, we are not talking about some indefinite amount of time, but rather the general concept of time, which is known to us. Therefore, the noun “time” here is definite.\nConsider now the sentence:\n“We don’t have to leave just yet; we have time.”\nHere, “time” has an indefinite meaning “[some] time”. \nAs opposed to this complicated situation in English, Arabic uses only the definite article ٱَلْ ʾal to make common nouns definite. So when translating sentences from English to Arabic, you must first determine whether the noun is definite or not in English, and then use ٱَلْ ʾal when the noun is definite.\nExamples:\n\n“This man gave that boy some food.”\n\nman: definite; Arabic: ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrujul\nboy: definite; Arabic: ٱَلْغُلَام ʾalg͡hulām\nfood: indefinite; Arabic: طَعَام ṭaɛām\n\n“Time is valuable.”\n\ntime: definite; Arabic: ٱَلْوَقْت ʾalwaqt\n\n“We don’t have to leave just yet; we have time.”\n\ntime: indefinite; Arabic: وَقْت waqt",

    "text": "3.3 State\nNouns in Arabic have a property called state. The state of a noun is dependent on the function of the noun in a sentence. The state of a noun is indicated by the noun’s ending. There are three states that a noun can be in. They are: \n\nthe raised-state. This is considered the ‘highest’ state. It is indicated, for most nouns, by a ḍammah on the final letter of the noun.\nthe propped-state. This is ‘lower’ than the raised-state.

It is indicated, for most nouns, by a kasrah on the final letter of the noun.\n\nWhen a noun is indefinite, then, for most nouns, it is also tanwīned.

    "section": "3.4 Grammatical gender",
    "text": "3.4 Grammatical gender\nSome nouns designate animate beings like “man”, “woman”, “boy”, “girl”, “dog”, “cow”, etc. Other nouns designate inanimate objects like “book”, “house”, “hand”, “tree”, “city”, “food”.\nIn dealing with the grammatical genders of such nouns, English uses three genders:\n\nThe masculine gender. This is used for nouns that designate male human beings and also some male animals. The pronouns used for the masculine gender are “he”, “him”, and “his”.\nThe feminine gender. This is used for nouns that designate female human beings, and also some female animals. The pronouns used for the feminine gender are “she” and “her”.\nThe neutral gender. This is used for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals in general. The pronoun used for the neutral gender is “it”.\n\nIn Arabic, there are only two grammatical genders: the masculine gender and the feminine gender. All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. Nouns that designate male human beings are assigned the masculine grammatical gender. And nouns that designate female human beings are assigned the feminine grammatical gender. Nouns that designate animals sometimes conform to the gender of the animal. Other times, they have a fixed gender. As for nouns that designate inanimate objects, these, too, are assigned a gender. For example, كِتَاب kitāb “book” in Arabic is masculine. And شَجَرَة s͡hajarah “tree” in Arabic is feminine. We shall discuss this in more detail below.\n\n3.4.1 Nouns that designate animate beings.\nIn Arabic, in terms of their form, nouns that designate animate beings are in three categories:\n\nThere are separate but matching nouns for the male and female animate beings.\nThere are separate and unrelated nouns for the male and female animate beings.\nThe same noun is used for both sexes.\n\nWe will discuss each of these categories below.\n\n3.4.1.1 Matching nouns for male and female animate beings\nIn Arabic for some nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for both sexes match each other. Here are some examples: \n\nPrimitive nouns\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\nmasc.\nson\n\n\nٱِبْنَة ʾibnah\nfem.\ndaughter\n\n\nطِفْل ṭifl\nmasc.\nchild\n\n\nطِفْلَة ṭiflah\nfem.\n(female) child\n\n\nإِنْسَان ʾinsān\nmasc.\nhuman being\n\n\nإِنْسَانَة ʾinsānah\nfem.\n(female) human being\n\n\nحُرّ ḥurr\nmasc.\nfree man\n\n\nحُرَّة ḥurrah\nfem.\nfree woman\n\n\nكَلْب kalb\nmasc.\n(male) dog\n\n\nكَلْبَة kalbah\nfem.\n(female) dog\n\n\nهِرّ hirr\nmasc.\n(male) cat\n\n\nهِرَّة hirrah\nfem.\n(female) cat\n\n\n\n\n\nDerived nouns\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nمُعَلِّم muɛallim\nmasc.\n(male) teacher\n\n\nمُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah\nfem.\n(female) teacher\n\n\nطَالِب ṭālib\nmasc.\n(male) student\n\n\nطَالِبَة ṭālibah\nfem.\n(female) student\n\n\nصَاحِب ṣāḥib\nmasc.\n(male) companion\n\n\nصَاحِبَة ṣāḥibah\nfem.\n(female) companion\n\n\nصَدِيق ṣadīq\nmasc.\n(male) friend\n\n\nصَدِيقَة ṣadīqah\nfem.\n(female) friend\n\n\n\nIn each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is basically the same as the masculine noun but with the addition of a ة at the end. For example, طِفْل ṭifl is masculine, and its feminine is طِفْلَة ṭiflah (fem.).\nAs a matter of fact, the ة is called a feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other, less common, feminine markers besides ة that we will learn them later, if Allāh wills.\nNote that the vowel-mark before the ة is always an fat·ḥah. \nNote also that we have divided the nouns above into two categories:\n\nPrimitive nouns\nDerived nouns\n\nPrimitve nouns have a primitive meaning, without a primarily adjectival or verbal quality in the meaning, for example “human” “cat”, etc. For derived nouns, their meaning is derived from an adjectival or verbal quality. For example, a “teacher” is someone who teaches. A “friend” is someone who is friendly. And so on.\n\nFor derived nouns, the formation of the feminine noun by adding a feminine marker (like ة) to the masculine noun is normal and expected. Whereas, for primitive nouns, the fact that the feminine and masuline nouns match each other and differ only by the feminine marker ة is something that, although somewhat common, is more of a coincidence.\nAnother noteworthy point is that, for many primitive nouns, sometimes only one of the masculine/feminine pair may be used to refer to beings of either sex. What we mean by this is that, for example, كَلْب kalb, while remaining a masculine noun, can be used to refer to both a male dog and a female dog, especially if the animal’s physical gender is not obvious or particularly important. And كَلْبَة kalbah (fem.) “a female dog” is typically only used when it is needed to specify the gender of the animal. Conversely, هِرَّة hirrah “a (female) cat” may be used to refer to cat of either physical gender, especially if it is not obvious whether it is a male or female cat.\nThis preference of the noun of one gender to refer to beings of either physical gender is case-by-case. For example, طِفْل ṭifl (masc.) is commonly used to say “a child”, regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl. But طِفْلَة ṭiflah, although not uncommon, is used specifically for “a female child”.\nAs another example, the word إِنْسَانَة ʾinsānah (fem.) “a female human being” is rarely used at all. Instead, the word إِنْسَان ʾinsān, while remaining a masculine noun, is almost always used to refer to “a human being” in general, regardless of actual gender.\nOn the other hand,  ٱِبْن ʾibn “son” and ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah “daughter” are only ever used for their respective gender. So ٱِبْن ʾibn (masc.) “a son” is never used to mean “a daughter”. And ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah (fem.) “a daughter” is never used to mean “a son”. \n\nAs for derived nouns, they are typically only ever used for their respective gender. So, for example, مُعَلِّم muɛallim (masc.) is only used for “a (male) teacher”. And مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) is only used for “a (female) teacher”.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Unrelated nouns for male and female animate beings\nFor other nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for the male and female sexes are completely unrelated. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nأَب ʾab\nmasc.\nfather\n\n\nأُمّ ʾumm\nfem.\nmother\n\n\nغُلَام g͡hulām\nmasc.\nboy\n\n\nجَارِيَة jāriyah\nfem.\ngirl\n\n\nعَبْد ɛabd\nmasc.\nmale slave\n\n\nأَمَة ʾamah\nfem.\nfemale slave\n\n\nأَسَد ʾasad\nmasc.\nlion\n\n\nلَبْوَة labwah\nfem.\nlioness\n\n\nثَوْر t͡hawr\nmasc.\nbull\n\n\nبَقَرَة baqarah\nfem.\ncow\n\n\n\nEven in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a ة feminine marker. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker like ة. أُمّ ʾumm “mother” is one of these exceptions.\n\n\n3.4.1.3 Using the same noun for both sexes\nThere are other nouns for animate beings where the same word is used for both sexes. The word itself will still be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nشَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ\nmasc.\nperson\n\n\nنَفْس nafs\nfem.\nself\n\n\nعَدُوّ ɛaduww\nmasc.\nenemy\n\n\nحَيَوَان ḥayawān\nmasc.\nanimal\n\n\nطَائِر ṭāʾir\nmasc.\nbird\n\n\nقِرْد qird\nmasc.\nmonkey\n\n\nحَمَامَة ḥamāmah\nfem.\ndove\n\n\nنَمْلَة namlah\nfem.\nant\n\n\n\nSo, for example, قِرْد qird “monkey” is grammatically masculine but it will be used for both a male and a female monkey. Similarly, شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ is a masculine noun meaning “person”. While remaining grammatically masculine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female persons. While, نَفْس nafs is a feminine noun meaning “self”. While remaining grammatically feminine, it can be used to refer to persons of male or female selves\nNote also that نَفْس nafs “self” is a feminine noun but it does not end in a ة. It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that don’t have a female marker, like أُمّ ʾumm (fem.) “mother”.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Nouns that designate inanimate objects\nAs mentioned earlier, nouns that designate inanimate objects are assigned a fixed grammatical gender. There is usually no discernable reason why some are assigned a masculine gender while others are assigned a feminine gender.\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nكِتَاب kitāb\nmasc.\nbook\n\n\nبَيْت bayt\nmasc.\nhouse\n\n\nقَلَم qalam\nmasc.\npen\n\n\nطَعَام ṭaɛām\nmasc.\nfood\n\n\nمَاء māʾ\nmasc.\nwater\n\n\nمَدْرَسَة madrasah\nfem.\nschool\n\n\nمَدِينَة madīnah\nfem.\ncity\n\n\nغُرْفَة g͡hurfah\nfem.\nroom\n\n\nشَجَرَة s͡hajarah\nfem.\ntree\n\n\nشَمْس s͡hams\nfem.\nsun\n\n\nقَمَر qamar\nmasc.\nmoon\n\n\nعِلْم ɛilm\nmasc.\nknowledge\n\n\nقُوَّة quwwah\nfem.\nstrength\n\n\nحَيَاة ḥayāh\nfem.\nlife\n\n\nمَوْت mawt\nmasc.\ndeath\n\n\n\nIn these nouns as well, we note that feminine nouns usually end with the feminine marker ة. But here too, we find another exception: شَمْس s͡hams “sun” which is feminine but does not end with a feminine marker. These exceptions are not very many and, if Allāh wills, we will not find it hard to memorize them.\nThere is a sub-group of nouns that designate inanimate objects, but can also be used to refer to animate beings. Here are a couple of examples:\n\n\n\nArabic word\nGender\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nرَهِينَة rahīnah\nfem.\npledge\n\n\nعُضْو ɛuḍw\nmasc.\nmember\n\n\n\nرَهِينَة rahīnah is a feminine noun meaning “pledge”. For inanimate objects it refers to something that is held as a security or a collateral. With its animate meaning, it is used to refer to a human hostage.\nSimilarly, عُضْو ɛuḍw is a masculine noun meaning “member”. For inanimate objects it refers to a limb which is the member of a body. With its animate meaning it refers to a person who is a member of a professional organization.\nJust like we saw for the nouns in section @using-the-same-noun-for-both-sexes, such nouns adhere to their fixed grammatical gender when used for either male or female persons.1\n\n\n3.4.3 Nouns with mismarked gender\nWe saw that there are some nouns that are feminine, but do not end with with a feminine marker like ة. These were:\n\nأُمّ ʾumm (fem.) “mother”\nنَفْس nafs (fem.) “self”\nشَمْس s͡hams (fem.) “sun”\n\nThere are a few more nouns that are like this. One special category among them is body parts. Many prominent body parts that come in pairs or more, are grammatically feminine, whether or not they end with a feminine marker like ة. Here are some examples:\n\n\nيَد yad (fem.) “hand” (sometimes “an arm”)\nعَيْن ɛayn (fem.) “eye”\nأُذُن ʾud͡hun (fem.) “ear”\nقَدَم qadam (fem.) “foot”\nرِجْل rijl (fem.) “leg” (sometimes “foot”)\nإِبْهَام ʾibhām (fem.) “thumb”\nإِصْبَع ʾiṣbaɛ (fem.) “finger, toe”\nسِنّ sinn (fem.) “tooth”\nرُكْبَة rukbah (fem.) “knee”\n\nThere are exceptions, however. The following body parts come in pairs yet are masculine.\n\nمَنْخَر mank͡har (masc.) “nostril”\nمِرْفَق mirfaq (masc.) “elbow”\n\nThere are other such exceptions as well.\n\nBody parts that don’t come in pairs are typically more regular in their gender: they are feminine if they end in a feminine marker like ة, and masculine if they don’t. Examples:\n\nرَأْس raʾs (masc.) “head”\nأَنْف ʾanf (masc.) “nose”\nبَطْن baṭn (masc.) “belly”\nلِحْيَة liḥyah (fem.) “beard”\n\nConversely, nouns that end with a feminine marker like ة, yet are masculine are very rare. Some of the more common of them are:\n\nخَلِيفَة k͡halīfah (masc.) “caliph”\nعَلَّامَة ɛallāmah (masc.) “great scholar”\nدَاعِيَة dāɛiyah (masc.) “great preacher”\n\nThere are also a few words which can be optionally assigned a masculine or feminine gender. Among these are:\n\nسُوق sūq (masc. or fem.) “market”\nطَرِيق ṭarīq (masc. or fem.) “path”\n\nA good dictionary should mention the gender of all these exceptional words. In addition, in appendix @ref(unmarked-fem-nouns) as well, we have a compiled a list of feminine nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker. (TODO: get from Hava: pg. xi (fem) and xii (admitting either gender).)",

    "section": "4.2 Forming subject-comment sentences",
    "text": "4.2 Forming subject-comment sentences\nHere is a subject-comment sentence:\n\n\nThe subject of the sentence is “the building”. This means that the sentence is about “the building”.\nThe comment is “a house”. This means that the comment that the sentence is giving us about the subject is that it is “a house”.\nLet’s try to form this sentence in Arabic.\nFirst we assemble the individual parts:\n\n“The building” in Arabic is ٱَلْبِنَاء ʾalbināʾ (masc.).\n“A house” is بَيْت bayt (masc.).\n\nNext we put them both in the raised-state. For subject-comment sentences, both the subject and the comment shall be in the raised-state. Remember that the raised-state is formed by putting a tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ at the end of an indefinite noun, and a ḍammah ◌ُ at the end of a definite noun. Here are the two nouns in the raised-state:\n\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ ʾalbināʾu (masc.) “the building” (raised-state)\nبَيْتٌ baytun (masc.) “a house” (raised-state)\n\nIn order to form this sentence in Arabic, we put the subject first and then the comment. So we get:\n\n\nBut wait! Where is the Arabic word for “is”? It turns out that Arabic does not usually express any word for “is”. Instead, the meaning of this word is implied.\nAlso, note that the final vowel mark at the end of the sentence is written but not pronounced. So we will write بَيْتٌ but say bayt, not baytun. This is in accordance with what we learned in section @ref(pronouncing-the-end-of-a-sentence).\nNow let’s try reversing this sentence, and try making the sentence:\n“The house is a building.”\nWe follow the same procedure by assembling the individual parts of the sentence and putting them in the raised-state:\n\nThe subject: ٱَلْبَيْتُ ʾalbaytu (masc.) “the house” (raised-state)\nThe comment: بِنَاءٌ bināʾun (masc.) “a building” (raised-state)\n\nAnd then we put them together, first the subject and then the comment:\nٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalbaytu bināʾ.\n“The house is a building.”\nand there we have our sentence.",

    "section": "4.3 Matching the gender between the subject and the comment",
    "text": "4.3 Matching the gender between the subject and the comment\nIn the sentences above, both the subject and the comment were masculine nouns. Now let’s try forming a sentence where the subject and the comment have different genders. Let’s try saying:\n“The building is a school.”\n\nThe subject: ٱَلْبِنَاءُ ʾalbināʾu (masc.) “the building” (raised-state)\nThe comment: مَدْرَسَةٌ madrasatun (fem.) “a school” (raised-state)\n\nIn the same manner as before, we form the sentence by first writing the subject and then the comment:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu madrasah.\n“The building is a school.”\nWe can also reverse this sentence:\nٱَلْمَدْرَسَةُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalmadrasatu bināʾ.\n“The school is a building .”\nSo we see that it is quite normal to have a sentence where the gender of the subject does not match the gender of the comment.  This is because the words we have dealt with so far denote animate objects. If either the subject or the comment denote animate beings, then in this case the subject and the comment often do match each other in gender. For example, let’s try to form the sentence:\n“The mother is a teacher.”\nHere are the indiviual words that we will use to form the sentence:\n\nThe subject: “the mother”: ٱَلْأُمُّ ʾalʾummu (fem.) (raised-state).\nThe comment: “a teacher”. We have two words for “a teacher” in Arabic:\n\nمُعَلِّم muɛallium (masc.) “a (male) teacher”\nمُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) “a (female) teacher”.\n\nObviously, مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah would apply here so we put it in the raised-state: مُعَلِّمَةٌ muɛallimatun (raised-state).\n\nNow we can assemble the sentence:\nٱَلْأُمُّ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾalʾummu muɛallimah.\n“The mother is a teacherf.”\nIn the reverse sentence “The teacher is a mother.”, we again use the feminine noun مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah (fem.) “a (female) teacher”, which is now the subject of the sentence, to match the feminine noun in the comment ٱَلْأُمّ ʾalumm (fem.) “a mother”. So we get:\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ أُمٌّ.\nʾalmuɛallimatu ʾumm.\n“The teacherf is a mother.”\n\nHere is another example:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ أَبٌ.\nʾarrujulu ʾab.\n“The man is a father.”\n\nNow, let’s try a sentence where we are still dealing with animate beings but the nouns mismatches in grammatical gender.\nٱَلْأُمُّ شَخْصٌ.\nʾalʾummu s͡hak͡hṣ.\n“The mother is a person.”\nٱَلشَّخْصُ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾas͡hs͡hak͡hṣu muɛallimah.\n“The person is a (female) teacher.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ شَخْصٌ.\nʾalmuɛallimatu s͡hak͡hṣ.\n“The (female) teacher is a person.”\nIn the above examples, the grammatical genders mismatch between the subject and the comment. But this is because we are matching with the physical gender of the person represented by the masculine noun شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ “a person”, not its grammatical gender.\nThe same effect is seen when using the word حَيَوان ḥayawān which is a masculine noun meaning “an animal”. It can be applied to both male and female animals. So we can say:\nٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرٌّ.\nʾalḥayawānu hirr.\n“The animal is a (male) cat.”\nand\nٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ.\nʾalḥayawānu hirrah.\n“The animal is a (female) cat.”",

    "section": "4.4 Detached pronouns",
    "text": "4.4 Detached pronouns\nPronouns, in Arabic, are special nouns that can be used in place of other nouns when it is known who is being referred to. This means that they can replace definite nouns only. Pronouns in English include words like “he”, “she”, “it”, “you”, “I”, etc.\nIn order to explain the usage of pronouns, we will first show a sentence with a noun subject:\n“The man is a teacher.”\nNow we you can replace the definite subject noun “the man” with the pronoun “he”:\n“He is a teacher.”\nIn Arabic there are a few different kinds of pronouns. Here we will learn detached pronouns. They are called detached pronouns because they are detached from other words. There are another set of pronouns called attached pronouns that we will learn later, if Allāh wills.\n\n4.4.1 Participants\nWhen talking about pronouns, it is beneficial to make use of a concept of grammar called participants.\nIn any kind of speech there are there can be up to three types of participants involved. A participant may be singular, i.e. consist of one individual, or plural, i.e., consist of more than one individual.\nThe three participants in speech are:\n\nThe speaker-participant. This is the participant who is speaking. When the speaker-participant refers to himself or herself (or themselves if plural) in English, then he/she/they use the pronouns “I”, “me”, “we”, and “us”.\nThe addressee-participant. This is the participant whom the speaker-participant is directly speaking to. When the speaker-participant refers to the addressee-participant in English, he uses the “you” pronoun.\nThe absentee-participant. This is the participant who is not being directly spoken to. Their only participation in the speech is that they are being referred to. When the speaker-participant refers to the absentee-participant in English, he uses the pronouns “he”, “him”, “she”, “her”, “it”, “they”, and “them”.\n\nIn this chapter we will learn the Arabic pronouns for the singular participants.\n\n\n4.4.2 Detached pronouns for the singular absentee-participant\nHere are the Arabic detached pronouns for the singular absentee-participant:\n\nsingular masculine absentee-participant: هُوَ huwa “he”.\nsingular feminine absentee-participant: هِيَ hiya “she”.\n\nHere are some examples of pair of sentences, each first with a noun, and then with a pronoun in place of the noun:\n\nٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾarrajulu muɛallim.\n“The man is a teacherm.”\nهُوَ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nhuwa muɛallim.\n“He is a (male) teacherm.”\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ طَالِبَةٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu ṭalibah.\n“The girl is a studentf.”\nهِيَ طَالِبَةٌ.\nhiya ṭalibah.\n“She is a studentf.”\nٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.\nʾalbaytu bināʾ.\n“The house is a building.”\nهُوَ بِنَاءٌ.\nhuwa bināʾ.\n“It is a building.”\nNote that Arabic uses the pronoun هُوَ huwa “he” to refer to the inanimate object “the house”. This is because, as we know, all nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine. In translating the sentence to English we will employ the neutral pronoun “it” to make the sentence sound natural.\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu madrasah.\n“The building is a school.”\nهُوَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. huwa madrasah.\nor\nهِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. hiya madrasah.\n“It is a school.”\nNote that either هُوَ huwa “he” or هِيَ hiya “she” can be used in the above sentence because the gender of the subject ٱَلْبِنَاء ʾalbināʾ (masc.) “the building” mismatches the gender of the comment مَدْرَسَة madrasah (fem.) “a school.”.\nIn such cases where the genders of the subject and the comment do not match, then, generally speaking, the pronoun for either gender could be employed with the following guideline:\nPrefer to match the gender of the subject pronoun with the gender of the comment, unless the noun being replaced with a pronoun is an animate being, in which case prefer to use the gender of the animate being.\nSo in the above sentence we will prefer to use هِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ. hiya madrasah. because the comment مَدْرَسَةٌ madrasatun “a school” is feminine.\nHere is an example with an animate being as the subject:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ إِنْسَانٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu īnsān.\n“The girl is a human.”\nهِيَ إِنْسَانٌ.\nhiya īnsān.\n“She is a human.”\nHere, if we replace the noun ٱَلْجَارِيَة ʾaljāriyah “the girl” with a pronoun, we will prefer to use هِيَ hiya “she”, because the girl is an animate being, even though the comment إِنْسَانٌ ʾinsānun “a human” is masculine.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Detached pronouns for the singular addressee-participant and speaker-participant\nHere are the pronouns for the singular addressee-participant and speaker-participant:\n\nsingular masculine addressee-participant: أَنْتَ ʾanta “youm”.\nsingular feminine addressee-participant: أَنْتِ ʾanti “youf”.\nsingular speaker-participant: أَنَا ʾana “I”.\n\nNote that the addressee-participant pronoun “you” has separate pronouns for the masculine and the feminine while the speaker-participant pronoun “I” has the same pronoun for both genders. Examples with these pronouns:\n\nأَنْتَ مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾanta muɛallim.\n“Youm are a teacherm.”\nأَنْتِ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.\nʾanti muɛallimah.\n“Youf are a teacherf.”\nأَنَا مُعَلِّمٌ.\nʾana muɛallim.\n“I am a teacherm.”\nأَنَا مُعَلِّمَة.\nʾana muɛallimah.\n“I am a teacherf.”\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Definiteness of pronouns\nWe stated, and saw, that pronouns can replace definite nouns. This means that pronouns themselves are definite nouns (even though they are not prefixed by ٱَلْ ʾal “the”).\nThis fact will be useful in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n4.4.5 Rigidity of pronouns\nRemember in section @ref(flexibility-of-nouns), we talked about the flexibility of nouns. We said that nouns whose endings change with the noun’s state are called flexible nouns. Most nouns fall into this category.\nPronouns, however, are nouns whose endings don’t change with their state. Therefore they fall into the category of rigid nouns.",

It can also be interpreted as a noun-phrase, meaning “the teacher-man”, instead of the complete sentence “The man is the teacherm.” Therefore, in order to disambiguate and make it clear that we mean the complete sentence, a disambiguating pronoun is usually (but not always) inserted between the subject and the comment. Disambiguating pronouns are detached pronouns that match the subject of the sentence in gender. With a disambiguating pronoun, the sentence above becomes:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ هُوَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ.\nʾarrajulu huwa -lmuɛallim.\n“The man is the teacherm.”\nThe disambiguating pronoun here is هُوَ huwa and is not translated.

So it is easier to start a sentence with “the man”.\nSo can we even have a sentence that has an indefinite subject? For example: \n\nA house is a building.\nA man is the teacher.\n\nYes, it is possible, but sentences where the subject is an indefinite noun are not as straightforward to express in Arabic.

Being a one-letter particle, it is joined to the word after it without any space between it and the next word.\nوَمَدْرَسَةٌ\nwamadrasatun\n“and a school”\nوَ wa meaning “and” does not change the state of the noun following it. Examples:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَسْجِدٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu masjidun wamadrasah.\n“The building is a mosque and a school.”\nIf there are more than two words, then in English, only the final word usually has “and” and the rest are separated by commas in writing.

    "section": "5.2 True prepositions",
    "text": "5.2 True prepositions\nTrue prepositions are particles. Particles are a class of words, like nouns and verbs. Particles don’t have the properties of nouns. Thus, they cannot be definite or indefinite. They cannot be preceded by ٱَلْ al nor may they be tanwīned. And they don’t have state (raised-state, propped-state, lowered-state).\nHere is a list of the more common true prepositions:\n\n\n\nPreposition\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nبِ bi\nwith, by, next to\n\n\nلِ li\nfor, to\n\n\nفِي fī\nin\n\n\nعَلَىٰ ɛalā\non\n\n\nإِلَىٰ ʾilā\nto, toward\n\n\nمِنْ min\nfrom\n\n\nعَنْ ɛan\nfrom, about\n\n\nكَ ka\nlike\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nPrepositions that are a single letter (like بِ bi, ل li, كَ ka) are joined to the following noun in writing. Example:\nبِقَلَمٍ\nbiqalamin\n“with a pen”\nلِرَجُلٍ\nlirajulin\n“for a man”\nكَٱبْنٍ\nka-bnin\n“like a son”\nWhen a single letter preposition comes before a definite noun with ٱَلْ al, the preposition is generally joined to the alif in the ٱَلْ al. The alif is now not pronounced (because as we know it has a connecting hamzah). Example:\nبِٱلْقَلَمِ\nbi-lqalami\n“with the pen”\nIf the noun begins with a connecting hamzah then the ل in ٱَلْ gets an kasrah ◌ِ instead of its usual sukūn ◌ْ. We described this in section @ref(the-definite-article-with-nouns-with-an-initial-connecting-hamzah). Example:\nكَٱلِٱبْنِ\nka-li-bni\n“like the son”\nThe only exception is the preposition لِ li. When joined to a definite noun with ٱَلْ al, the alif in ٱَلْ is dropped and we write the two lāms together. Example:\nلِلرَّجُلِ\nli-rrajuli\n“for the man”\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ\nli-ljāriyati\n“for the girl”\nلِلِٱبْنِ\nli-li-bni\n“for the son”\nHowever, in this case, if the noun too starts with a lām, then we drop the entire ٱَلْ al (in writing, not in meaning). This is to avoid having three lāms joined to each other. Example:\nٱَللُّعْبَةُ\nʾalluɛbatu\n“the toy”\nbecomes\nلِلُّعْبَةِ\nli-lluɛbati\n“for the toy”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) لِللُّعْبَةِ\nThis is also true for the phrase:\nلِلَّـٰهِ\nlillāhi\n“for Allāh”\nwhich is formed from لِ + ٱللَّـٰهِ\nThe prepositions عَلَىٰ ɛalā “on” and إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” have a long-ā vowel at the end but it is written with a dotless yāʾ ىٰ instead of an alif. (We have already learned that some words are written this way in section @ref(a-vowel-written-with-a-ya).)\nPrepositions that are composed of multiple letters are not joined to the following noun. Example:\nإِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ\nʾilā madrasatin\n“to a school”\nIf a preposition ends with a long vowel, then, as usual, it get shortened to a short vowel when it is followed by a word which begins with a connecting hamzah. Examples:\nفِي ٱلْبَيْتِ\nfi -lbayti\n“in the house”\nإِلَى ٱبْنٍ\nʾila -bnin\n“to a son”\nIf a preposition ends with a sukūn ◌ْ and it is followed by a word that begins with a connecting hamzah, then the sukūn is changed to a short vowel according to the following rules:\n\nThe ending of the preposition عَنْ ɛan gets an kasrah and becomes عَنِ ɛani. Examples:\nعَنِ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nɛani -rrajuli\n“from the man”\nعَنِ ٱبْنٍ\nɛani -bnin\n“from the son”\nThe ending of the preposition مِنْ min gets an fat·ḥah if followed by the ٱَلْ al of a definite noun. Otherwise it gets an kasrah if followed by any other connecting hamzah. Examples:\nمِنَ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nmina -rrajuli\n“from the man”\nمِنِ ٱبْنٍ\nmini -bnin\n“from a son”",

    "text": "5.4 Attached pronouns\nWe have already learned detached pronouns هُوَ, هِيَ, and أَنَا in section @ref(detached-pronouns). Detached pronouns are the equivalent of “he”, “she”, and “I”, etc. They are used in place of nouns that are in the raised-state.\nNow we will learn about attached pronouns. Attached pronouns are, more or less, the equivalent of “him”, “her”, and “me”, etc. They are used in place of nouns that are in the propped-state and the lowered-state. One place where attached pronouns are used is when the replace the noun directly following a preposition.\nThe singular attached pronouns are listed below. The detached pronouns are included as well for easy comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nDetached pronoun\nAttached pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee\nهُوَ huwa “him”\nهُ -hu “him”\n\n\nFem. absentee\nهِيَ hiya “her”\nهَا -hā “her”\n\n\nMasc. addressee\nأَنْتَ ʾanta “you1,m”\nكَ -ka “you1,m”\n\n\nFem. addressee\nأَنْتِ ʾanti “you1,f”\nكِ -ki “you1,f”\n\n\nSpeaker\nأَنَا ʾana “I”\nي “me”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Attached pronouns with prepositions\nAs mentioned above, one place the attached pronouns are used are after prepositions. Here are some notes regarding how they attach to prepositions:\n\nGenerally, these pronouns attach to the last letter of the preposition before it. Examples:\n\nمِنْكَ minka “from you”\nمَعَهُ maɛahu “with him”\nعَنْهَا ɛanhā “from her”\n\nThe ىٰ ā ending of prepositions become ◌َيْ -ay when attaching an attached pronoun. Examples:\n\nإِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to her”\nعَلَيْكَ ɛalayka “on youm”\n\nThe pronoun هُ -hu “him” becomes هِ hi when it is preceded by the vowels ◌ِ -i, ◌ِي -ī, or the semi-vowel ◌َيْ -ay. So we get\n\nبِهِ bihi “with him”\nفِيهِ fīhi “in him”\nإِلَيْهِ ʾilayhi “to him”\n\nThe attached pronoun for the speaker deserves special attention. The pronoun itself is the letter ي. But it has two variants:\n\n◌ِي -ī\n◌ِيَ -iya \n\nGenerally, both of these variants cause the final letter of the word before them, if a consonant, to have an kasrah ◌ِ, regardless of the whether or not that letter originally had an kasrah. Examples:\n\nلِي lī and لِيَ liya “for me”\nبِي bī and بِي biya “with/by me”\nمَعِي maɛī and مَعِيَ maɛiya “together with me”\nعِنْدِي ɛindī and عِنْدِيَ ɛindiya “at me”\n\nBetween these two, variants, ◌ِي -ī is more commonly used generally, except in the cases described in the next point, below:\nFor any word that ends with a long vowel (-ā, -ī, or -ū) or a semi-vowel (-ay or -aw), the variant ◌ِي -ī for the speaker attached pronoun is not used. Instead, only the variant يَ -ya may be used with such words.\nPrepositions that fall under this category are فِي fī, عَلَىٰ ɛalā, إِلَىٰ ʾilā, and لَدَىٰ ladā. Furthermore, the ىٰ -ā ending in these will become ◌َيْ ay instead when attaching the pronoun.\nIn addition, the pronoun يَ -ya will not cause the final letter of word before it to have an kasrah because it does that only to consonants, not to vowels or semivowels.\nSo we get:\n\nيَ + فِي = فِيَّ fiyya “in me”\nيَ + إِلَيْ = إِلَيَّ ʾilayya “to me”\nيَ + عَلَيْ = عَلَيَّ ɛalayya “on me”\nيَ + لَدَيْ = لَدَيَّ ladayya “at me”.\n\nThe preposition كَ ka “like” is not used with any attached pronoun. So, for example, we don’t say:\n\n\\(\\times\\) كَهُ kahu for “like him.”\n\nInstead, we will learn another method to express this meaning in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\nThe word “between”, because of its meaning, is typically used with two or more individuals. For example, “between us”, “between you and him”, etc. In Arabic, when the pseudo-preposition بَيْنَ bayna is used with a singular attached pronoun, it is repeated. For example,\n\nبَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ baynī wabaynaka “between me and you”",

Note that the preposition فِي fī “in” only puts the noun after it (ٱلْبَيْتِ ʾalbayti “the house”) in the lowered-state. It has no effect on the state of the noun before it (رَجُلٌ rajulun “a man”). In this case, it is in the raised-state.\nInstead of an indefnite noun, we can also put a definite noun in front of the prepositional phrase.

Examples:\nإِلَى ٱلمَدْرَسَةِ وَإِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ\nʾila -lbayti walmadrasati\n“to the school to and the house”\nإِلَى ٱلمَدْرَسَةِ وَٱلْبَيْتِ\nʾila -lbayti walmadrasati\n“to the school and the house”\nNote that when you don’t repeat the preposition, the second noun is still in the lowered-state.\nIn English, you have a similar option when you use pronouns instead of nouns. All of the following should be acceptable:\n“to the boy and me”\n“to the boy and to me”\n“to him and me”\n“to him and to me”\nIn Arabic, however, if one or more pronouns is used then the prepositions must be repeated. Examples:\nإِلَيَّ وَإِلَى ٱلْغُلَامِ\nʾilayya waʾila -lg͡hulāmi\n“to me and to the boy”\nإِلَيَّ وَإِلَيْهِ\nʾilayya waʾilayhi\n“to me and to him”",

    "section": "5.9 To have something",
    "text": "5.9 To have something\nEnglish uses the verb “have” or “has” to express that someone Arabic does not have a verb for “have” or “has”. In order to express sentences like\n“I have a book.”\n“The boy has a father.”\nArabic uses prepositions like\n\nلِ li “for”\nعِنْدَ ɛinda “at”\nلَدَىٰ ladā “at”\nمَعَ maɛa “together with”\n\nHere are some examples:\nلِلْغُلَامِ أَبٌ.\nli -lg͡hulāmi ʾab.\n“The boy has a father.” (literally: “For the boy is a father.”)\nعِنْدَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ.\nɛinda -rrajuli kitāb.\n“The man has a book.” (literally: “At the man is a book.”)\nمَعَ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ لُعْبَةٌ.\nmaɛa -ljāriyati luɛbah.\n“The girl has a toy.” (literally: “With the girl is a toy.”)\nHere are some notes that can help you choose which preposition to use to express “has” or “have”:\n\nلِ li “for” is used to express personal relationships, like “I have a friend”, “I have a son”, etc. It is also used when you wish to imply that you own the object. For example, the sentence\nلِلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ.\nli -rrajuli kitāb.\nimplies that the man owns a book. But it is possible that he has lent it to someone else so he does not actually have it on his person or at his house, etc.\nعِنْدَ ɛinda “at” is used to express that the person has the object in his possession, but not necessarily that he has it with him right now. For example the sentence\nعِنْدَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ.\nɛinda -rrajuli kitāb.\nimplies that the man has a book in his possession. But it is possible that it may not be with him right now. It may be at his house or elsewhere.\nلَدَىٰ ladā “at” is used to express that the person has the object in his possession and that he has it with him right now. For example the sentence\nلَدَى ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ.\nlada -rrajuli kitāb.\nimplies that the man has a book in his possession and that he has it with him right now.\nمَعَ maɛa “together with” is used to express that the person has the object with him right now. But it doesn’t necessarily imply ownership. For example, the sentence\nمَعَ ٱلرَّجُلِ كِتَابٌ.\nmaɛa -rrajuli kitāb.\nmeans that the man has a book with him right now. But it is possible that he does not own it and that someone else has lent it to him.\n\nThere is some degree of overlap in meaning and you will get a feeling of which preposition is more appropriate in which circumstance as you progress in your learning, if Allah wills. For now, if you find that the object can be used with all of these prepositions, you might go with عِنْدَ ɛinda as it is the more commonly used.",

    "section": "6.2 Arabic word roots",
    "text": "6.2 Arabic word roots\nWe take this opportunity to learn about Arabic roots. Native Arabic words, both nouns and verbs, are generally derived from roots. Most roots are comprised of three letters. A smaller number are comprised of four or more letters.\nWords are derived from their roots according to patterns. In traditional Arabic grammar studies, the root فعل is used as a paradigm for three-letter roots to showcase word and meaning patterns.\nSo for example, the word بَيْت bayt “a house” is derived from the root بيت. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can see that the pattern of the word بَيْت bayt is فَعْل faɛl. The أَمْر ʾamr “a matter” is derived from the root ءمر. Its pattern is also فَعْل faɛl.\nSimilarly, the word مَكْتَب maktab “a library” is derived from the root كتب. And مَلْعَب malɛab “a playground” is derived from the root لعب. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can see that the pattern of both these words is مَفْعَل mafɛal. Here, the letter م m is an extraneous letter added to form the words and is not part of their roots.\nNot only nouns, but verbs, too, are derived from roots. All verbs are derived from their roots in a fixed set of patterns called forms which are numbered 1 onward. For example, the past form 2 verb pattern is فَعَّلَ faɛɛala and the past form 3 verb pattern is فَاعَلَ fāɛala. There are approximately 9-10 forms that are in common usage. In addition, there are a few higher order forms (11 onward) that are less common. In this chapter will study the past form 1 verb only.",

    "text": "6.3 The form 1 past verb\nHere are some examples of past form 1 verbs in Arabic:\n\n\n\nRoot\nPast form 1 verb\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nفعل\nفَعَلَ faɛala\n“did”\n\n\nذهب\nذَهَبَ d͡hahaba\n“went”\n\n\nكتب\nكَتَبَ kataba\n“wrote”\n\n\nقرء\nقَرَأَ qaraʾa\n“read”\n\n\nجلس\nجَلَسَ jalasa\n“sat”\n\n\nسءل\nسَأَلَ saʾala\n“questioned”\n\n\nسكت\nسَكَتَ sakata\n“became quiet”\n\n\nجعل\nجَعَلَ jaɛala\n“made”\n\n\nعلم\nعَلِمَ ɛalima\n“knew”\n\n\nعمل\nعَمِلَ ɛamila\n“worked”\n\n\nكبر\nكَبُرَ kabura\n“grew”\n\n\n\nNote that فعل, in addition to being used as a paradigm root, also has a verb in its own right: فَعَلَ faɛala “did”.\nNote, also, that the past form 1 verb consists only of the three letters of the root. The first and the final letter always have an fat·ḥah while the middle letter’s vowel is variable. It may have an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or an ḍammah, depending on the verb. Using the paradigm root فعل, we can say that the form 1 verb occurs in the patterns فَعَلَ, فَعِلَ, and فَعُلَ.\nA good dictionary will tell us the middle vowel mark of a particular verb. However, as a trend, the fat·ḥah is the most common for the middle vowel mark, followed by the kasrah, while the ḍammah is the least common.\nInterestingly, there can exist multiple verbs from the same root, each with its own distinct meaning, that differ only in the vowel mark on the middle letter. An example of two such verbs is:\n\nحَسَبَ ḥasaba “calculated”\nحَسِبَ ḥasiba “deemed”\n\nYou can see above how the verb كَتَبَ kataba “wrote” is derived from the root كتب. We have already, by the way, learned another word derived from this root: the noun كِتَاب kitāb “a book”, which is on the pattern فِعَال fiɛāl. Note how both the verb and the noun derived from this root have a meaning that is common and has to do with writing or of something written. In a similar manner, you will often see that words derived from the same root generally share some common meaning, although this common meaning may not always be obvious or straightforward.",

    "section": "6.4 Verbal sentences",
    "text": "6.4 Verbal sentences\nWe have already learned of subject-comment sentences. Here we will learn of a new type of sentence called a verbal sentence. A verbal sentence is one that begins with a verb.\nWhen a verb is in a sentence, it requires a doer. The doer is a noun which represents the person who does the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence “The boy went.”, the noun “the boy” is the doer of the verb.\n\n6.4.1 Verbs with a masculine doer noun\nConsider the sentence:\n“The boy went.”\nIn order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulām.\n“The boy went.”\nذَهَبَ d͡hahaba “went” is the verb and ٱلْغُلَامُ alg͡hulāmu “the boy” is the doer. Note how the doer is in the raised-state. Also note that in English the doer comes before the verb whereas in Arabic the doer comes after the verb in sentence word order. We can state this as a rule of Arabic grammar:\nIn Arabic, every verb in a sentence shall have a doer noun. The doer noun shall be in the raised-state and shall come after the verb in sentence word order.\n\nIn the above example the doer noun was definite, but a doer may be indefinite too. Example:\nذَهَبَ رَجُلٌ إِلَىَ ٱلسُّوقِ.\nd͡hahaba rajulun ʾila -ssūq.\n“A man went to the market.”\nIn the above sentence, the doer noun رَجُلٌ rajulun is indfinite.\n\n\n6.4.2 Verbs with a feminine doer noun\nNow consider the sentence:\n“A girl went.”\nIn order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyah.\n“A girl went.”\nNote that we have modified the verb by adding on the letter تْ at the end. This تْ is used when the doer is ia feminine noun. It is called the تْ of femininity.\nIf the word following the noun begins with a connecting hamzah then we add a helper vowel to the تْ and it becomes تِ. Examples:\nجَلَسَتِ ٱلْهِرَّةُ عَلَى ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.\njalasati -lhirratu ɛala -lkursiyyi.\n“The catf sat on the chair.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلطِّفْلَةُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibati -ṭṭiflatu fi -lbayt.\n“The childf played in the house.”",

    "title": "6  The past verb",
    "section": "6.5 Verbs with doees",
    "text": "6.5 Verbs with doees\n\n6.5.1 The direct doee\nConsider the sentence:\n“The man wrote a book.”\nIn this sentence, “wrote” is the verb, “the man” is the doer, and “a book” is what we shall call the doee. In fact, it is what we shall call a direct doee because the verb directly takes the doee without an intervening preposition. A doee is the noun to whom the action of the verb is done.\nIn Arabic, we will express the sentence “The man wrote a book.” by saying:\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.\nkataba -rrajulu kitābā.\n“The man wrote a book.”\nNote how in Arabic the doee كِتَابًا kitāban “a book” is in the propped-state. This is because, in Arabic, verbs shall cause a direct doee to be in the propped-state. This is true whether the direct doee is definite or indefinite. Here is another example:\n\nسَأَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلْجَارِيَةَ.\nsaʾalati -lʾummu -ljāriyah.\n“The mother questioned the girl.”\nNote again how ٱلْجَارِيَةَ aljāriyata “the girl” is in the propped-state because it is a direct doee.\n\n\n6.5.2 Multiple direct doees\nSome verbs can take more than one direct doee. In this case, all direct doees shall be in the propped-state. For example,\nجَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُسْلِمًا.\njaɛala -llāhu -rrajula muslimā.\n“Allāh made the man a Muslim.”\nIn this sentence both ٱلرَّجُلَ arrajula “the man” and مُسْلِمًا musliman “a Muslim” are direct doees of the verb جَعَلَ jaɛala and therefore both are placed in the propped-state.\n\n\n6.5.3 The indirect doee\nInstead of, or in addition to, direct doees, some verbs take an indirect doee. An indirect doee is one before which there is a preposition. For example, in English we might say:\n“The man looked at the moon.”\nIn this sentence, “the moon” is an indirect doee because it is preceded by the preposition “at”. Similarly, in Arabic, we will say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ إِلَى ٱلْقَمَرِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu ʾila -lqamar.\n“The man looked at the moon.”\nIn this sentence ٱَلْقَمَرِ alqamari “the moon” is an indirect doee of the verb نَظَرَ naḍ͡hara “looked” because it is preceded by the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to”. The preposition, as usual, causes the word after it (the indirect doee ٱَلْقَمَرِ ʾalqamari) to be in the lowered-state, as opposed to the propped-state of the direct doee.\nNote also, that the verb “looked” in English used the preposition “at” whereas the Arabic verb نَظَرَ naḍ͡hara used the preopsition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” for the same meaning. This is very common and you should not expect Arabic to use exact counterparts of the prepositions used in English. In fact, everytime you learn a new verb, you should also learn the prepositions that go with it.\nIt is also possible for the same verb to take different prepositions with possibly different meanings. So, for example, we can say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْأَمْرِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu fi -lʾamri.\n“The man looked into the matter.” \nIt may also be possible for the same verb to take a direct doee. So we could also say:\nنَظَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمَكْتُوبَ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ.\nnaḍ͡hara -rrajulu -lmaktūba fi -lkitābi.\n“The man viewed what was written in the book.” \nA good dictionary will tell us which prepositions are used with indirect doees with a given verb and also whether it takes a direct doee.\nSome verbs take a direct doee and another indirect doee, both at the same time. For example,\nسَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾala -lg͡hulāmu -lmuɛallimata ɛan ʾamr.\n“The boy asked the teacherf about a matter.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةَ ʾalmuɛallimata “the teacherf” is the direct doee, and therefore it is in the propped-state. أَمْرٍ ʾamrin “a matter” is an indirect doee, and so it is in the lowered-state. The preposition عَنْ ɛan is translated, here, as “about”.\nIt is also possible that an English verb may take a direct doee, while the corresponding Arabic verb may only take an indirect doee. The reverse is also quite possible. For example,\nغَفَرَ ٱللَّـٰهُ لِلْمُسْلِمِ.\ng͡hafara -llāhu lilmuslimi.\n“Allāh forgave the Muslim.”\nThe verb “forgave” in English takes a direct doee for the person who is forgiven. In Arabic, however, the corresponding verb غَفَرَ g͡hafara “forgave” takes the forgiven person as an indirect doee, using the preposition لِ li.",

    "section": "6.6 Verbs with doer pronouns",
    "text": "6.6 Verbs with doer pronouns\nWe have learned that a pronoun is a special kind of noun that can be used to replace a definite noun. And we have already learned two category of pronouns in Arabic:\n\nDetached pronouns, like هُوَ, هِيَ, etc.\nAttached pronouns, like هُ, هَا, etc.\n\nNow we would like to replace the doer noun of a verb with a pronoun. For example, instead of saying:\n“The man went.”\nwe would like to say:\n“He went.”\nFor this we will have to learn a third category of pronoun pronouns called doer pronouns for past verbs. doer pronouns are of two types: (i) expressed and (ii) implied.\nHere we list the singular doer pronouns in Arabic.\n\n\n\nSingular participant\ndoer pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee (“he”)\nimplied\n\n\nFem. absentee (“she”)\nimplied\n\n\nMasc. addressee (“you1,m”)\nتَ -ta\n\n\nFem. addressee (“you1,f”)\nتِ -ti\n\n\nSpeaker (“I”)\nتُ -tu\n\n\n\nWe will now give an explanation of the above doer pronouns.\n\n6.6.1 doer pronouns for the singular absentee-participant (“he”/“she”)\nThe doer pronouns of the absentee-participant are the equivalent of “he” and “she”. For example, let’s try to replace the doer-noun “the man” in the sentence: “The man went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nd͡hahaba -rrajul.\n“The man went.”\nWhen we replace the doer noun ٱلرَّجُل ʾarrujul “the man” with the doer pronoun “he”, we get:\nذَهَبَ.\nd͡hahab.\n“[He] went.”\nAs you can see, all we did was omit the doer-noun ٱَلرَّجُل ʾarrujul, and we didn’t add any word to replace it as the doer pronoun. This is because the doer pronoun for “he” is implied and automatically comes into place when we omit the doer noun.\nThe doer pronoun for “she” is similarly implied. For example, if we replace the doer noun in the sentence:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ كِتَابًا.\nqaraʾati -ljāriyatu kitābā.\n“The girl read a book.”\nwe get:\nقَرَأَتْ كِتَابًا.\nqaraʾat kitābā.\n“[She] read a book.”\n\n6.6.1.1 Explanation of implied pronouns\nWhy do we have to go to all the trouble of saying that the doer-pronouns of the singular absentee-participants “he” and “she” are implied? Why can’t we simply say that there are no doer-pronouns for the singular absentee-participants?\nThe reason is that  we need to be able to state, as a rule of grammar, that every verb needs to have its own doer, whether expressed or implied. Later, if Allāh wills, when we study verbs with dual and plural doers we will see that this will make a difference in the formation of the verb. \n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Doer pronouns for the singular addressee (“you1”) and speaker (“I”) participants\nIt is only the doer pronouns for the singular absentee participant that are implied for past verbs. The doer pronouns for the singular addressee and speaker participants are expressed. The expressed doer pronouns are attached to the verb.\nHere we show how the expressed doer pronouns are attached to the verb using the root paradigm فعل. The middle root letter (ع) has an fat·ḥah ◌َ here but this vowel will vary for other verbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular participant\nDoer pronoun\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAddressee “you1,m”\nتَ -ta\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\n\n\nAddressee “you1,f”\nتِ -ti\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\n\n\nSpeaker “I”\nتُ -tu\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\n\n\n\nNote also how the expressed singular doer pronouns modify the verb by replacing the fat·ḥah ◌َ on its final letter by a sukūn ◌ْ.\nFurthermore, note how the doer pronoun for the addressed person “you” is differentiated for masculine and feminine doers whereas the doer pronoun for the speaking person “I” is the same for both genders.\nHere are some examples of sentences with expressed doer pronouns:\nكَتَبْتَ كِتَابًا.\nkatabta kitābā.\n“Youm wrote a book.”\nذَهَبْتُ.\nd͡hahabt.\n“I went.”\nThe above sentence ends with the doer pronoun, so the vowel-mark on the doer pronoun is not pronounced (d͡hahabt). So, how would be know which doer pronoun it is? That is, does the sentence say “I went.” or “Youm went.” or “Youf. went.”? The answer is that the sentence by itself is ambiguous and context would tell us which of the three options is intended.\nTake care to note that the singular doer pronouns modify the final letter of the basic verb, whereas the تْ of femininity does not. So make sure you see the difference in the following two sentences:\nقَرَأْتِ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nqaraʾti -lkitāb.\n“Youf read the book.”\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْكتَابَ.\nqaraʾati -lkitāb.\n“She read the book.”\n\n\n6.6.3 Assimilation of the doer pronoun\nIf the final letter of the root of a verb is ت, then it gets assimililated with the ت which is the doer pronoun and only one ت, representing both, is written. Consider the verb:\nسكت سَكَتَ sakata “became quiet”\nWhen we add a expressed doer pronoun to this verb, we get:\nسَكَتُّ\nsakattu\n“I became quiet”\nسَكَتَّ\nsakatta\n“You1,m became quiet”\nسَكَتِّ\nsakatti\n“You1,f became quiet”\nAssimilation is treated in more detail in chapter/appendix TODO.",

    "section": "6.7 Verbs with doee pronouns",
    "text": "6.7 Verbs with doee pronouns\nJust like doer nouns may be replaced with doer pronouns, so, too, may doee nouns be replaced with doee pronouns. Doee pronouns are also attached to the end of the verb but they don’t modify the vowel on the final letter of the verb. The doee pronouns are the same attached pronouns that are also used with prepositions:\n\n\n\nSingular participant\nDoee pronoun\n\n\n\n\nMasc. absentee\nهُ -hu “him”\n\n\nFem. absentee\nهَا -hā “her”\n\n\nMasc. addressee\nكَ -ka “you1,m”\n\n\nFem. addressee\nكِ -ki “you1,f”\n\n\nSpeaker\nي “me”\n\n\n\nHere are some notes regarding their usage:\n\nDoee pronouns shall always be attached to the verb. So if there is a doer noun then it shall be placed after the attached doee pronoun. For example:\nسَأَلَهُ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nsaʾalahu -lg͡hulām.\n“The boy asked him.”\nIf however, the doer is also a pronoun, then it shall be attached first to the verb and then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the doer pronoun. For example,\nسَأَلْتُكِ.\nsaʾaltuk.\n“I asked youf.”\nIf the doer pronoun is implied, then the doee pronoun shall be attached to the verb again directly with only a possible تْ of femininity intervening. For example:\nسَأَلَهَا.\nsaʾalahā.\n“He asked her.”\nسَأَلَتْكَ.\nsaʾalatk.\n“She asked youm.”\nIf the doee pronoun هُ -hu “him” is preceded by the vowels i, ī, or ay then it shall instead become هِ hi with no change in meaning. (We’ve already learned this rule.) For example,\nسَأَلْتِهِ.\nsaʾaltih\n“Youf asked him.”\nAn intervening ن is always used between the verb and the speaker-participant doee pronoun variants ◌ِي -ī and ◌ِيَ -iya. Remember that these pronouns force any consonant before it to have a kasrah ◌ِ. Therefore, the combination will be written as نِي -nī and نِيَ -niya respectively. For example:\nسَأَلَنِي رَجُلٌ.\nsaʾalanī rajul.\n“A man asked me.”\nسَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nsaʾalaniya -rrajul.\n“The man asked me.”\n\nIf there is an expressed doer pronoun, the intervening ن shall come after it so that the ن is always connected to the doee pronoun. For example,\nسَأَلْتَنِي.\nsaʾaltanī\n“Youm asked me.”\nBy the way, we have already seen this intervening ن before when it was used with some prepositions, e.g. مِنِّي minnī, عَنِّي ɛannī, and لَدُنِّي ladunnī \nThe variant ◌ِي -ī is, in general, more commonly used, However, when the noun following it begins with a connecting hamzah then the variant ◌ِيَ -ya is preferred. That is why we used the variant ◌ِيَ -ya when it was followed by a connecting hamzah (سَأَلَنِيَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.), and the variant ◌ِي -ī when it was not followed by a connecting hamzah (سَأَلَنِي رَجُلٌ.). But this preference is not mandatory. So it is allowed for ◌ِي -ī to be used when followed by a connecting hamzah. When this happens, the long vowel -ī will be shortened to -i in connecting it to the next word, although the ◌ِي is retained in writing. For example,\nسَأَلَنِي ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nsaʾalani -rrajul.\n“The man asked me.”",

    "text": "6.8 Multiple verbs for one doer\nIn this section we will use the verbs:\n\n\n\nRoot\nPast form 1 verb\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nدخل\nدَخَلَ dak͡hala\n“entered”\n\n\nخرج\nخَرَجَ k͡haraja\n“exited”\n\n\nءكل\nأَكَلَ ʾakala\n“ate”\n\n\nشرب\nشَرِبَ s͡hariba\n“drank”\n\n\n\nConsider, now, the sentence:\n“I entered the room, ate, drank, and exited.”\nThe doer in this sentence is the pronoun “I”. This same doer is doing the action of multiple verbs: “entered”, “ate”, “drank”, and “exited”. When we try to express this sentence in Arabic we must remember that every verb shall have its own doer, and that the doer shall occur after it in sentence word order. So we will say:\nدَخَلْتُ ٱلْغُرْفَةَ فَأَكَلْتُ فَشَرِبْتُ فَخَرَجْتُ.\ndak͡haltu -lg͡hurfata faʾakaltu fas͡haribtu fak͡harajt.\n“I entered the room and then I ate and then I drank and then I exited.”\nNote also, that we need to replace the commas by connecting particles like وَ wa- “and”, or فَ fa- “so”/“and then”, etc. We chose فَ fa- which implies consequence or subsequence between the individual events.\nLet’s now try this sentence with a doer noun instead of a doer pronoun:\n“The girl entered the room, ate, drank, and exited.”\nHere is our translation:\nدَخَلَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْغُرْفَةَ فَأَكَلَتْ فَشَرِبَتْ فَخَرَجَتْ.\ndak͡halati -ljāriyatu -lg͡hurfata faʾakalat fas͡haribat fak͡harajat.\n“The girl entered the room and then she ate and then she drank and then she exited.”\nEach verb again has its own doer, which is coming after the verb in sentence word order. The doer of the first verb دَخَلَ dak͡hala “entered” is the noun ٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ʾaljāriyatu “the girl”. The subsequent verbs all have doers too but they are the implied doer pronouns for the singular feminine absentee participant. That is why we don’t write them. Note also that every verb has the تْ of femininity attached to it to indicate its singular feminine absentee doer.",

    "section": "6.9 Order of words in a sentence",
    "text": "6.9 Order of words in a sentence\n\n6.9.1 Changing the order of words for emphasis\nIn Arabic, the doer always follows the verb. So the normal order of a sentence is verb-doer-doee. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.\nkataba -rrajulu kitābā.\n“The man wrote a book.”\nHowever, we will often come across sentences like:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.\nʾarrajulu kataba kitābā.\nIt may appear as if ٱَلرَّجُلُ arrajulu is the doer and it is coming before the verb كَتَبَ kataba. But actually, this is not the case. As a matter of fact, this sentence is basically a subject-comment sentence.\nHere ٱَلرَّجُلُ arrajulu “the man” is the subject of the sentence, and كَتَبَ كِتَابًا kataba kitāban “he wrote a book”, itself a verbal sentence with an implied doer pronoun, is the comment about the subject. So the translation of the sentence is technically:\n“The man, he wrote a book.”\nHowever, this can be an awkward translation so we will usually translate it as “The man wrote a book.” \nThe question arises: if both sentences above have the same translation, then why would we say ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا ʾarrajulu kataba kitāban instead of the more normal كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا kataba -rrajulu kitāban? The answer is that this change in the sentence’s word order is done in order to give more emphasis to the doer, as if to say:\n“The man wrote a book.”\nSo in Arabic, the order of words is generally more flexible than in English and this is often used to give emphasis to certain words.\n\n\n6.9.2 Verbs pull definite nouns towards them\nWhen a verb has a doer noun and a doee noun, the normal order of words in a sentence is: verb, doer noun, doee noun. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba -rrajulu -lkitāba.\n“The man wrote the book.”\nThere is a tendency, in Arabic, for verbs to pull definite nouns towards them. This means that if there are any indefinite nouns, they have a tendency to get pushed father away. So, for example, if a verb’s doer is an indefinite noun and the doee is a definite noun, the doee will often (but not always) precede the doer. For example,\nكَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ رَجُلٌ.\nkataba -lkitāba rajul.\n“A man wrote the book.”\nThe vowel-marks at the end of the nouns, and context, will tell us which is the doer and which is the doee. In this particular example, it was optional, and not mandatory to make the definite doee precede the doer in sentence word order. So we could have also said, instead:\nكَتَبَ رَجُلٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba rajuluni -lkitāb.\n“A man wrote the book.”\nNow let’s take a look at sentences with pronouns. Remember that pronouns are a category of nouns, and also (from section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns)) that they are definite nouns. In fact they are stronger in definiteness than words that are made definite using ٱَلْ. This because if when we say “The man wrote the book.” instead of “A man wrote the book.”, we assume that everyone knows which man we are referring to. Now if we replace “the man” with the pronoun “he”: “He wrote the book.”, then this assumption becomes stronger. “He” is, in a sense, more definite than “the man.”.\nSo now, when the direct doee noun ٱلْكِتَابَ ʾalkitāba “the book” is replaced with the pronoun “it”, the doee pronoun must be attached to the verb, and then the doer noun follows the doee pronoun:\nكَتَبَهُ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\nkatabahu -rrajulu.\n“The man wrote it.”\nThis can be seen as a mandatory case of the verb pulling the definite noun toward it.\nNow, consider a sentence with an indirect doee. Again, the normal order of words in a sentence is verb, doer noun, preposition, doee noun. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu ʾila -lmadrasah.\n“The boy went to the school.”\nNow, if we replace the indirect doee noun ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ. ʾalmadrasati “the school” with the pronoun “it”, the indirect doee pronoun هَا -hā “it” is attached, not to the verb, but to the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā thus: إِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to it”. So it possible to preserve the original order of words in the sentence:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَيْهَا.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu ʾilayhā.\n“The boy went to it.”\nWhile the above sentence is correct, it is in fact more common to place the preposition and doee pronoun إِلَيْهَا ʾilayhā “to it” right after the verb, and before the doer noun, thus:\nذَهَبَ إِلَيْهَا ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba ʾilayha -lg͡hulāmu.\n“The boy went to it.”\nThis is because the pronoun هَا -hā “it” is stronger in definiteness than ٱلْغُلَام ʾalg͡hulām “the boy”. So the verb has a stronger pull towards it. \nThis ordering of words due to the attractive pull of the verb is largely learned by experience. The more you read Arabic, the better feel you will get for it, if Allāh wills.",

    "text": "6.12 Separating doee pronouns from the verb\nFIXME: move to imperfect verb chapter\nWe have mentioned that doee pronouns are attached to the verb. Sometimes there is a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb. When separating the doee pronoun from the verb, it is instead attached to the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā. So then we get the following doee pronouns:\n\n\n\nPerson\nDoee pronoun\n\n\n\n\nAbsent person (masc.) “him”\nإِيَّاهُ ʾiyyāhu\n\n\nAbsent person (fem.) “her”\nإِيَّاهَا ʾiyyāhā\n\n\nAddressed person (masc.) “youmasc.”\nإِيَّاكَ ʾiyyāka\n\n\nAddressed person (fem.) “youfem.”\nإِيَّاكِ ʾiyyāki\n\n\nSpeaking person (masc. and fem.) “me”\nإِيَّايَ ʾiyyāya\n\n\n\nNote that for the speaking person “me”, there is no intervening ن between the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā and the doee pronoun. Note also that only يَ -ya is allowed to be attached to the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā. This is because ◌ِي -ī is not permitted to be used with words that end in a long vowel (-ā, -ī, or -ū) or a semi-vowel (-ay or -aw). And the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā ends with the long-vowel ā.\nBut we may ask why is there a need to separate the doee pronoun from the verb? This can occur for a couple of reasons:\n\nIf there are multiple doee pronouns, only one of them can be attached to the verb. Example,\nضَرَبَتْنِي وَإِيَّاهُ.\nḍarabatnī wa ʾiyyāhu.\n“She hit me and him.”\nIf the doee is placed before the verb for emphasis. Example,\nإِيَّايَ ضَرَبَتْ.\nʾiyyāya ḍarabat.\n“She hit me.”",

    "section": "7.5 Adjectival nouns in Arabic and genderizability",
    "text": "7.5 Adjectival nouns in Arabic and genderizability\n\nArabic does not have adjectives. It only has adjectival nouns.\nThe word صَغِير ṣag͡hīr is an example of an indefinite adjectival noun in Arabic. It describes the quality of being “small” or “little”. It can be used to denote any person, animal, or things that can be described as being small. Technically we could translate it as “a little onem” or “a small onem”.\nBeing a noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr, like all other nouns in Arabic, will have a grammatical gender. Since it does not end with a feminine marker like ة, we can state that صَغِير ṣag͡hīr is a masculine noun.\nAdjectival nouns, typically, are genderizable. This means that we can feminize صَغِير ṣag͡hīr (masc.) to get the feminine noun. We will feminize صَغِير ṣag͡hīr (masc.) with the feminine marker ة to get the feminine adjectival noun صَغِيرَة ṣag͡hīrah (fem.) “a little onef”.\nGenerally, the dictionary will typically only supply the masculine adjectival noun. And we are expected to know how to feminize it to get the feminine adjectival noun.\nAs opposed to adjectival nouns, common nouns are not genderizable. So, for example, if we know that the noun غُلَام g͡hulām “a boy” exists, we cannot assume that we can feminize it, by using the feminine marker ة, for example, getting: \\(\\times\\) غُلَامَة g͡hulāmah. This would be a misguided attempt to obtain the meaning for “a girl” in Standard Arabic. Instead, we have to look up the Arabic word for “a girl” in the dictionary separately, and we find that it is جَارِيَة jāriyah.\nMany times times, a masculine/feminine common noun pair will exist, that differ only by the feminine marker ة. For example:\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” and ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah “a daughter”.\nمُعَلِّم muɛallim “a teacherm” and مُعَلِّمَة muɛallimah “a teacherf”\n\nThis does not indicate that the common noun is genderizable. Rather, when the common noun masc./fem. pair has a meaning that is derived from a verb or an adjective (like مُعَلِّم/مُعَلِّمَة), then the masculine/feminine pair are co-derived as separate non-genderizable words. We will discuss this in more detail in later chapters, if Allāh wills.\nAnd when the common noun masc./fem. pair has a primitive (non-verbal and non-adjectival) meaning, (like ٱِبْن/ٱِبْنَة), then this is only a coincidence. We alluded to this in section @ref(related-nouns-for-male-and-female-animate-beings).\n\n7.5.1 Examples of Arabic adjectival nouns\nHere are some examples of Arabic adjectival nouns that we will use in this chapter.\n\n\n\nArabic adjectival noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nكَبِير kabīr\na big one\n\n\nصَغِير ṣag͡hīr\na small one\n\n\nطَيِّب ṭayyib\na good one\n\n\nقَدِيم qadīm\nan old one\n\n\nجَدِيد jadīd\na new one\n\n\nطَوِيل ṭawīl\na long/tall one\n\n\nوَاسِع wāsiɛ\na wide one\n\n\nعَرَبِيّ ɛarabiyy\nan Arab\n\n\nمَشْهُور mas͡h·hūr\na famous one",

    "text": "7.6 The describer and the describee in describee-describer phrases\nLet’s learn how describee-describer phrases are formed in Arabic.\nWe learned in section @ref(terminology-the-describer-and-the-describee) above that describee-describer phrases consist of a describer and a describee.\nIn English describee-describer phrases, like “the small house”, the adjective describer (“small”) comes before the describee (“house”). Also, only one definite article (“the”) is used before the entire noun-phrase.\nHere is the equivalent Arabic describee-describer phrase:\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe adjectival noun describer ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” comes after the describee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house”.\nBoth the adjectival noun describer ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” and the describee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” get the definite article ٱَلْ “the”.\nThe adjectival noun describer ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” is genderized to match the describee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” in gender.\nThe adjectival noun describer ٱَلصَّغِير ʾaṣṣag͡hīr “the small onem” matches the describee ٱَلْبَيْت ʾalbayt “the house” in state. In this example, they were both in the raised-state but we will see examples in the other states as well.\nThe word-for-word equivalence of the above describee-describer phrase is “the small-one house” but we will usually give the more natural translation: “the small house”\n\nLet’s try another example: let’s try to translate the sentence: “The little girl took a new book from the good mother.”\nHere is the sentence in Arabic:\nأَخَذَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ كِتَابًا جَدِيدًا مِنْ ٱلْأُمِّ ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ.\nʾak͡had͡hati -ljāriyatu -ṣṣag͡hīratu kitaban jadīdan mina -lʾummi -ṭṭayyibah.\n“The little girl took a new book from the good mother.”\nThis sentence has three describee-describer phrases. We will analyze each one individually:\n\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ\nʾaljāriyatu -ṣṣag͡hīratu\n“the little girl”\nIn this phrase the definite feminine noun ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ʾaljāriyatu is the doer of the verb أَخَذَ ʾak͡had͡ha “took”. Therefore it is in the raised-state. It is also the describee in the describee-describer phrase. Its describer ٱَلصَّغِيرَةُ ʾaṣṣag͡hīratu follows the describee and is made to match the describee in state (raised-state), gender (feminine), and definiteness (definite).\nكِتَابًا جَدِيدًا\nkitāban jadīdan\n“a new book”\nIn this phrase the indefinite masculine noun كِتَابًا kitāban is the direct doee of the verb أَخَذَ ʾak͡had͡ha “took”. Therefore it is in the propped-state. It is also the describee in the describee-describer phrase. Its describer جَدِيدًا jadīdan follows the describee and is made to match the describee in state (propped-state), gender (masculine), and definiteness (indefinite).\nٱَلْأُمِّ ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ\nʾalʾummi -ṭṭayyibati\n“the good mother”\nIn this phrase the definite feminine noun ٱلْأُمِّ ʾalʾummi is following the preposition مِنْ min “from”. Therefore it is in the lowered-state. It is also the describee in the describee-describer phrase. Its describer ٱَلطَيِّبَةِ ʾaṭṭayyibati follows the describee and is made to match the describee in state (lowered-state), gender (feminine), and definiteness (definite).\nNote carefully that the describer matches the describee in gender, not necessarily in having the same ة ending. The feminine adjectival noun describer ٱَلطَيِّبَة ʾaṭṭayyibah is still formed using the feminine marker ة, despite the feminine describee ٱَلْأُمّ not having the ة feminine marker.\n\n\nSometimes, a common noun of one gender is used to refer to persons of either gender. For example:\n\nthe noun شَخْص s͡hak͡hṣ is itself a masculine noun but it may be used to refer to both male and female persons.\n\nIf such a noun is a describee, then we will prefer to match the describer to the grammatical gender of the noun, not the physical gender of the person it is referring to. For example:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ شَخْصٌ طَيِّبٌ.\nʾaljāriyatu s͡hak͡hṣun ṭayyib.\n“The girl is a good person.”\nSee how we preferred to use the masculine adjectival noun طَيِّب ṭayyib instead of using the feminine طَيِّبَة ṭayyibah.",

    "text": "7.7 Adjectival nouns as the comment of a sentence\n\n7.7.1 Indefinite adjectival noun\nLet’s see how to use Arabic adjectival nouns as the comment of a sentence.\n\n\nIn the above sentence, the indefinite adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a small one” is used as the comment of a sentence. Its indefiniteness and raised-state is indicated by the tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ on its end.\nWhen an adjectival noun is the comment of a sentence, then it shall be genderized to match the gender of the subject noun. The subject noun in this case (ٱَلْبَيْت) is masculine. Therefore, the masculine adjectival noun (صَغِير) is chosen.\nTechnically, the translation of this sentence is “The house is a small one.” However, because Arabic has only adjectival nouns and not adjectives, it is how we can express the English sentence “The house is small.” Therefore we can also translate it into English as such.\nNow let’s try a sentence with a feminine subject:\nٱَلْجَارِيَةُ صَغِيرَة.\nʾaljāriyatu ṣag͡hīrah\n“The girl is a little onef.” = “The girl is little.”\nIn the above example the subject (ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl”) was feminine. Therefore, we feminized the masculine adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr with the feminine marker ة to get the feminine adjectival noun صَغِيرَة ṣag͡hīrah “a little onef” and used the feminine adjectival noun in the sentence.\n\n\n7.7.2 Definite adjectival noun\nLet’s see if a definite adjectival noun can be used in the comment. For example, we would like to say “The old tree is the big one.”\nThe subject of the sentence is ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmuiatu “the old tree”. And the comment is ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ ʾalkabīratu “the big one”. When we put the two together we get:\nٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ\nʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmatu -lkabīratu\nThe problem is that the above could also be interpreted as one phrase “the big old tree”, and not as the complete sentence “The old tree is the big one.” This is the same problem that we highlighted in section @ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info).\nThe solution, too, is the same. We insert a detached pronoun, that matches the gender of the subject, between the subject and the comment. So in order to get our intended meaning, we will say:\nٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْقَدِيمَةُ هِيَ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ.\nʾas͡hs͡hajaratu -lqadīmatu hiya -lkabīratu.\n“The old tree is the big one.”",

    "text": "7.8 Adjectival nouns used without a described noun\nWe have mentioned that adjectival nouns are just like other nouns that we have learned so far, in that they have gender, state, and definiteness. Can we then use an adjectival noun by itself and not when it is describing another noun?\nThe answer is yes, we can. So for example, you can say:\nشَرِبَ ٱلصَّغِيرُ حَلِيبًا.\ns͡hariba -ṣṣag͡hīru ḥalībā.\n“The little one drank some milk.”\nThe above is a correct sentence. But, by itself, it is not very clear. What do we mean by “the little one”? Is it a little boy, or a little cat, or something else? So, context would be needed to know what exactly is being denoted by the adjectival noun when it is used by itself independently.\nHere is the same sentence again, but this time with some clarifying context.\nحَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ. وَشَرِبَ ٱلصَّغِيرُ حَلِيبًا.\nḥamalati -lʾummu -ṣṣag͡hīra. was͡hariba -ṣṣag͡hīru ḥalībā.\n“The mother carried the little one.

    "section": "7.9 Adjectival nouns re-used as common nouns",
    "text": "7.9 Adjectival nouns re-used as common nouns\nSometimes, an adjectival noun, through much usage, acquires the meaning of a common noun. It then gets listed with this meaning in the dictionary. We actually just saw an example above. The adjectival noun صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a little one” is commonly used to mean “a baby”. Of course, context would be needed to know whether, in a particular sentence, it has its common noun meaning: “a baby”, or its general adjectival noun meaning: “a little one”.\nThe opposite of صَغِير ṣag͡hīr “a little one” is كَبِير kabīr “a big one”. It too has acquired the common noun meaning of “an elder person”. Here is an example of its usage:\nقَدِمَ ٱلْكَبِيرُ وَوَعَظَ ٱلْغُلَامَ.\nqadima -lkabīru wawaɛaḍ͡ha -lg͡hulāma.\n“The elder arrived and admonished the boy.”\nWhen an adjectival noun gets re-used as a common noun, it loses its genderizability. For example, the feminine adjectival noun حَسَنَة ḥasanah (fem.) “a good one” is re-used as a common noun meaning “a good deed”. So we can use it in a sentence:\nٱلصِّيَامُ حَسَنَةٌ.\nʾaṣṣiyāmu ḥasanah.\n“Fasting is a good deed.”\nThe subject in this sentence is the masculine noun ٱَلصِّيَام ʾaṣṣiyām “fasting”. And the comment is the feminine noun حَسَنَة ḥasanah “a good deed”. Note that the comment does not match the subject in gender. This is because it lost its genderizability since it is no longer acting as an adjectival noun “a good onef”, but rather as the common noun “a good deed”.\nWhat if we have the sentence:\nٱَلصَّدَقَةُ حَسَنَةٌ.\nʾaṣṣadaqatu ḥasanah.\nThe feminine gender of the subject ٱَلصَّدَقَة. ʾaṣṣadaqah “charity” now matches the gender of the comment حَسَنَة ḥasanah. So now, technically, the comment could be the adjectival noun, meaning “a good onef”. So the sentence could mean:\n“Charity is good.”\nOr the comment could be the common noun, meaning “a good deed”. Then the sentence would mean:\n“Charity is a good deed.”\nContext would be needed to tell us which meaning is intended.",

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nNouns are of two main categories of nouns, with regard to their endings in the different noun states:\nSo far we have been mostly studying fully-flexible nouns. In this chapter we will learn about semi-flexible nouns.\nHere is an example of the kind of nouns we have learned so far:\nAs you can see, the noun is tanwīned when it is indefinite, and also, the vowel mark on the last letter changes for each state that the noun is in. These kinds of nouns are called fully-flexible nouns. They are by far the most common type of noun.\nThere are some nouns, however, that are semi-flexible. Here is an example of a semi-flexible noun, صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ “a desert”:\nAs you can see, when صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ is indefinite, it is not tanwīned. Also, when it is indefinite and in the lowered-state, the vowel mark on its final letter is not ◌ِ, as you might expect but ◌َ . And so the noun looks identical in the propped-state and lowered-state when it is indefinite.\nWhen it is definite, however, it looks just like fully-flexible nouns.\nSo there are two differences between fully-flexible and semi-flexible nouns:\nThe other category of nouns are rigid nouns. Rigid nouns don’t change their endings due to their state. They are much fewer in number compared to flexible nouns. Pronouns are an example of rigid nouns.",

    "section": "8.2 Feminine markers",
    "text": "8.2 Feminine markers\nBefore we discuss semi-flexible nouns in more detail, we will discuss feminine markers. We already know of one feminine marker: the ة. When a singular noun ends with ة, then that is an indication, with very few exceptions, that it is a feminine noun. Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nFeminine noun\nMasculine noun from same root (if any)\n\n\n\n\nجري\nجَارِيَة “a girlf”\n–\n\n\nعلم\nعَالِمَة “a scholarf”\nعَالِم “a scholarm”\n\n\nكلب\nكَلْبَة “a dogf”\nكَلْب “a dogm”\n\n\nشجر\nشَجَرَة “a tree”\n–\n\n\nصغر\nصَغِيرَة adj. “smallf”\nصَغِير adj. “smallm”\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the feminine marker ة is never part of the noun’s root. It is thus considered extrinsic to the root. Also, sometimes, but not always, the feminine noun is formed by adding the feminine marker ة to the end of a masculine noun.\nIt is also important to note that ة is only a feminine marker for singular nouns. When we learn plurals, if Allāh wills, we will see that ة is used frequently with masculine plurals.\nNow we will learn of two more feminine markers: اء and ىٰ.\nHere are some examples of nouns that end with these two feminine markers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nFeminine noun\nMasculine noun (if any)\n\n\n\n\nصحر\nصَحْرَاء “a desert”\n–\n\n\nحمر\nحَمْرَاء adj. “redf”\nأَحْمَر adj. “redm”\n\n\nذكر\nذِكْرَىٰ “a remembrance”\n–\n\n\nغضب\nغَضْبَىٰ adj. “very angryf”\nغَضْبَان adj. “very angrym”\n\n\n\nWhen extrinsic to the word’s root, اء and ىٰ are feminine markers, just like ة. However, one important difference from ة is that sometimes اء and ىٰ may not be extrinsic to the word’s root. In this case, they will not be feminine markers, and the noun will regularly be a masculine noun. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nNoun\nPattern using paradigm فعل\n\n\n\n\nهدي\nٱلْهُدَىٰ (masc.) “the guidance”\nٱَلْفُعَل\n\n\nخبء\nخِبَاء (masc.) “a tent”\nفِعَال\n\n\n\nThese cases will become more clear, if Allāh wills, when we study weak roots (roots that contain a weak letter like ء، و، ي).\nOtherwise, when extrinsic to the word’s root, اء, and ىٰ are consistently feminine markers, just like ة.\nAlso, just like ة, اء and ىٰ are only feminine markers for singular nouns. We will see, if Allāh wills, that they are used frequently with masculine plurals.\nBy the way, another difference from ة is that when اء and ىٰ are feminine markers, and a masculine counterpart exists, then the feminine noun is not formed by simply adding the feminine marker to the end of the masculine noun. The masculine and feminine nouns are different internally as well. For example, the feminine noun حَمْرَاء adj. “redf” is not formed simply by adding the feminine marker اء to the end of the masculine noun أَحْمَر adj. “redm”.\nWe will discuss this in more detail below.",

    "section": "8.3 Categories of semi-flexible nouns",
    "text": "8.3 Categories of semi-flexible nouns\nWe now return to our discussion of semi-flexible nouns. Semi-flexible nouns, in terms of their formation, fall under different categories. We will discuss them below.\nWhen discussing semi-flexible nouns in isolation we will add the numeral 2 as a superscript to their ending, thus: 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2. This is to indicate their semi-flexibility. \n\n8.3.1 Nouns that end with an extrinsic اء\nIf a noun ends with an اء, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, then it shall be a semi-flexible noun.\nWe have already seen an example of such a noun above: 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”. The root of this noun is صحر. You can see that the ending اء is not part of the root. Therefore it is a semi-flexible noun.\nFurthermore, we have also learned that this اء, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, is a feminine marker for singular nouns, just like ة, except that ة does not generally make a noun semi-flexible.\nHere is an example sentence with this noun:\nذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ إِلَىٰ صَحْرَاءَ وَاسِعَةٍ.\nd͡hahaba -rrajulu ʾilā ṣaḥrāʾa wāsiɛah.\n“The man went to a wide desert.”\nNote that the vowel mark on the final letter of صَحْرَاءَ ṣaḥrāʾa is ◌َ, not ◌ٍ, even though it is indefinite and in the lowered-state (because it is preceded by the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to”). This is because it is a semi-flexible noun.\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 in this sentence is also a describee, whose describer is وَاسِعَةٍ wāsiɛatin “wide”. The final vowel mark ◌َ on the describee صَحْرَاءَ ṣaḥrāʾa has no effect on the final vowel mark on the describer وَاسِعَةٍ wāsiɛatin “wide”. All that matters in this regard is the state of the describee.\nNote, also, that the describer وَاسِعَة is feminine to match the gender of the describee 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2.\nNote, as well, that the describer وَاسِعَةٍ is tanwīned as it is indefinite and fully-flexible. The inability of its describee 2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 to be tanwīned (because of its semi-flexibility) does not affect the describer.\nAlso, beware, as we’ve already mentioned, that there are some words where the اء ending may be part of the word’s root, for example خِبَاء k͡hibāʾ “a tent” from the root خبء on the pattern خِبَاء. Such words will be fully flexible.  Also, for the same reason, اء in this word is not a feminine marker, and the word is masculine.\n\n\n8.3.2 Nouns that end with an extrinsic ىٰ\nIf a noun ends with an ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root, then it shall be a semi-flexible noun.\nWe’ve already seen an example of such a word: 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”. The root of this word is ذكر and it is on the pattern فِعْلَىٰ.\nWe’ve also learned that, similar to اء, this ىٰ, which is extrinsic to the word’s root, is a feminine marker for singular nouns.\nSince 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 already ends with the vowel-mark ◌ٰ, the last letter won’t have any additional vowel markers and therefore the word will appear the same in all states:\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\npropped-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\nlowered-state\nذِكْرَىٰ\nٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ\n\n\n\nTherefore, the state of such nouns cannot be determined by the vowel mark on their final letter, and has to be deduced otherwise by their function in the sentence. Nevertheless, these nouns are still included in the category of semi-flexible nouns, and not rigid nouns. This is because rigid nouns are closed set consisting only of pronouns and other similar words.\nHere is an example of this word in a sentence:\nٱَلْكِتَابُ ذِكْرَىٰ جَمِيلةٌ.\nʾalkitābu d͡hikrā jamīlah.\n“The book is a beautiful remembrance.”\nNote, again how the describer جَمِيلَة jamīlah is feminine and in the raised-state, in order to match the gender and state of the describee 2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2.\nBeware also that, just like in the case of اء, there are some words where ىٰ may be part of the word’s root, e.g. ٱَلْهُدَىٰ ʾalhudā “the guidance” whose root is هدي. Because here the ىٰ in ٱلْهُدَىٰ is part of the word’s root, therefore it shall not be a semi-flexible noun. So, when it is indefinite, it will be tanwīned: هُدًى hudan “a guidance”. Also, for the same reason, ىٰ in this word is not a feminine marker, and the word is masculine.\n\n\n8.3.3 Nouns on the pattern أَفْعَل\nIf a noun is on the pattern أَفْعَل ʾafɛal then it shall be a semi-flexible noun. By the way, there is no feminine marker on such words, so they will be masculine by default.\nMost colors and many physical characteristics fall into this pattern. Colors and physical characteristics are adjectival nouns. The masculine noun for such adjectival nouns is on the pattern أَفْعَل ʾafɛal. And the feminine adjectival noun is on the pattern فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ (which is itself a semi-flexible noun pattern because of the extrinsic اء ending). Here are some examples of such adjectival nouns:\n\n\n\nRoot\nMasc. Noun\nFem. noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nحمر\n2أَحْمَر\n2حَمْرَاء\nred\n\n\nسود\n2أَسْوَد\n2سَوْدَاء\nblack\n\n\nبيض\n2أَبْيَض\n2بَيْضَاء\nwhite\n\n\nعرج\n2أَعْرَج\n2عَرْجَاء\nlame\n\n\nحور\n2أَحْوَر\n2حَوْرَاء\nbeautiful eyed\n\n\nبكم\n2أَبْكَم\n2بَكْمَاء\nmute\n\n\n\nExample:\nلَبِسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ قَمِيصًا أَبْيَضَ.\nlabisa -rrajulu qamīṣan ʾabyaḍ.\n“The man wore a white shirt.”\n\n\n8.3.4 Adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان {Adjectival noun-an-diptote}\nThe letters ان may be an extrinsic ending for nouns. This ending is not a feminine marker so the noun would typically be masculine. This ending may cause the noun to be semi-flexible.\nThis category is more complicated than the previous ones. The following conditions must be satisfied for a word that ends with ان to be a semi-flexible noun:\n\nThe noun must be a adjectival noun on the pattern فَعْلَان. So the common noun ثُعْبَان t͡huɛbān “a serpent” of the root ثعي is a common noun and therefore, not a semi-flexible noun.\nThe ان must be extrinsic to the word’s root. So جَبَان jabānun “cowardly”, an adjectival noun of the root جبن, is not a semi-flexible noun.\nThe feminine of the adjectival noun shall not be formed by adding ة to the masculine noun. So نَدْمَان nadmān “regretful”, an adjectival noun from the root ندم, is not a semi-flexible noun, because its feminine is نَدْمَانَة nadmānah.\n\nIt is rare that this last condition fails. Most adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان are of the pattern فَعْلَان faɛlān and their feminine is of the pattern فَعْلَىٰ faɛlā (which is itself a semi-flexible noun pattern). These adjectival nouns typically have an emphatic meaning. The following are examples of semi-flexible adjectival nouns that fall into this category:\n\n\n\nRoot\nMasc. Noun\nFem. noun\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nغضب\n2غَضْبَان\n2غَضْبَىٰ\nvery angry\n\n\nعطش\n2عَطْشَان\n2عَطْشَىٰ\nvery thirsty\n\n\nجوع\n2جَوْعَان\n2جَوْعَىٰ\nvery hungry\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Nouns of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف\nNouns that are of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف are also semi-flexible nouns. Here each letter ف could be any letter of the alphabet.\nHere are some examples of these nouns:\n\n2مَسَاجِد masājid2 “mosques”\n2مَفَاتِيح mafātīḥ2 “keys”\n\nThese patterns are only used for plurals and we will study them in more detail in chapter @ref(broken-plurals) , if Allāh wills.",

    "section": "9.2 Forming the dual",
    "text": "9.2 Forming the dual\nThe dual is formed by appending the dual suffix ◌َانِ -āni when the noun is in the raised-state and ◌َيْنِ -ayni when the noun is in the propped-state or lowered-state. Definite nouns, which have ٱَلْ in their beginning are dualized the same way.\nFor example, when we dualize بَيْت bayt “a house” in order to say “houses2”, we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nبَيْتَانِ baytāni\nٱَلْبَيْتَانِ ʾalbaytāni\n\n\npropped-state and lowered-state\nبَيْتَيْنِ baytayni\nٱَلْبَيْتَيْنِ ʾalbaytayni\n\n\n\nNote that indefinite duals are not tanwīned. The only difference between definite and indefinite duals is the definite article ٱَلْ “the”.\nHere are examples of duals in sentences:\n\nraised-state:\nٱَلْكِتَابَانِ فِي ٱلْحَقِيبَةِ.\nʾalkitābāni fi -lḥaqībah.\n“The books2 are in the bag.”\npropped-state:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ كِتَابَيْنِ.\nqaraʾa -lg͡hulāmu kitābayn.\n“The boy read two books.”\nlowered-state:\nغَضِبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ عَلَى ٱلْجَارِيَتَيْنِ.\ng͡haḍibati -lʾummu ɛala -ljāriyatayn.\n“The mother became angry at the girls2.”  ### Nouns ending in ة\n\nIf a noun ends with a ة, then it is converted to a ت before appending the dual suffix. For example, dualizing شَجَرَة s͡hajarah “a tree”, we get “trees2”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\nIndefinite\nDefinite\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nشَجَرَتَانِ s͡hajaratāni\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَانِ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratāni\n\n\npropped-state and lowered-state\nشَجَرَتَيْنِ s͡hajaratayni\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَيْنِ ʾas͡hs͡hajaratayni\n\n\n\nExample:\nٱَلشَّجَرَتَانِ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ.\nʾas͡hs͡haratāni fi -lḥadīqah.\n“The trees2 are in the garden.”\nIf a feminine noun does end with a ة then it will simply be appended with ◌َانِ -āni and ◌َيْنِ -ayni. For example, dualizing أُمّ ʾumm “a mother” in order to get “mothers2”, we get:\n\nraised-state: أُمَّانِ ʾummāni\npropped-state and lowered-state: أُمَّيْنِ ʾummayni\n\nThere are some nouns that end with an alif before the ة, like فَتَاة fatāh “a young woman”. We will learn how to dualize these nouns later, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n9.2.1 Nouns ending with اء\nIf a noun ends with the feminine marker اء which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ء shall be replaced with a و when forming the dual. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nDual (raised-state)\nDual (propped-state and lowered-state)\n\n\n\n\nصحر\nصَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَانِ ṣaḥrāwāni\nصَحْرَاوَيْنِ ṣaḥrāwayni\n\n\nحمر\nحَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ “redf”\nحَمْرَاوَانِ ḥamrāwāni\nحَمْرَاوَيْنِ ḥamrāwayni\n\n\n\nThere are other words where the ء in the اء ending originates from the word’s root. Example:\n\nخبء خِبَاء (masc.) “a tent”, pattern: فِعَال\n\nWe will learn how to form duals of these words in later chapters, if Allāh wills. \n\n\n9.2.2 Nouns ending with ىٰ\nIf a noun ends with ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ىٰ shall be changed to a يَ when adding the dual suffixes. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nDual (raised-state)\nDual (propped-state and lowered-state)\n\n\n\n\nغضب\nغَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf”\nغَضْبَيَانِ g͡haḍbayāni\nغَضْبَيَيْنِ g͡haḍbayayni\n\n\nذكر\nذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَانِ d͡hikrayāni\nذِكْرَيَيْنِ d͡hikrayayni\n\n\n\nJust like in the case of اء, there are some words where ىٰ is not extrinsic to the word’s root. Example:\n\nهدي ٱلْهُدَىٰ (masc.) “the guidance”, pattern: ٱَلْفُعَل\n\nWe will learn how to form duals of these words in later chapters, if Allāh wills.",

This gives more emphasis to the subject. In this case, the verb shall follow the subject and will need a doer pronoun after it.\nٱَلرَّجُلَانِ ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nʾarrujalāni d͡hahabā ʾilā baytin.\n“The men2, they2 went to a house.”\n= “The men2 went to a house.”\nIf there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer in a verbal sentence, the doer noun will follow the first verb and the rest of the verbs will have doer pronouns. For example:\nأَكَلَ ٱلرَّجُلَانِ وَشَرِبَا وَذَهَبَا.\nʾakala -rrajulāni was͡haribā wad͡hahabā.\n“The men2 ate and they2 drank and they2 went.”\n= “The men2 ate and drank and went.”\nThe above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a subject-comment sentence.

    "text": "10.3 The āt sound plural\nThe āt sound plural is formed by adding the ending ات āt to the indefinite singular noun. \nHere is the āt sound plural of حَيَوَان ḥayawān “an animal”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nIndefinite ūn plural “animals”\nDefinite ūn plural “the animals”\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nحَيَوَانَاتٌ ḥayawānātun\nٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ ʾalḥayawānātu\n\n\npropped-state and lowered-state\nحَيَوَانَاتٍ ḥayawānātin\nٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ ʾalḥayawānāti\n\n\n\nNote that: \n\nUnlike the ūn sound plural, the āt sound plural is tanwīned when indefinite.

We will learn how to pluralize these nouns later, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n10.3.2 Nouns ending with اء\nConsistent with what we learned for duals in section @ref(duals-of-extrinsic-alif-mamduda), if a noun ends with the feminine marker اء which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ء shall be replaced with a و when forming the āt sound plural. Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nصحر\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَات ṣaḥrāwāt\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Nouns ending with ىٰ\nConsistent with what we learned for duals in section @ref(duals-of-extrinsic-alif-maqsura), If a noun ends with ىٰ which is extrinsic to the word’s root then the ىٰ shall be changed to a يَ when when forming the āt sound plural. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nذكر\n2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَات d͡hikrayāt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Common nouns of the patterns فَعْل/فَعْلَة, فِعْل/فِعْلَة, and فُعْل/فُعْلَة\nCommon nouns of the patterns فَعْل/فَعْلَة, فِعْل/فِعْلَة, and فُعْل/فُعْلَة are treated specially when forming their āt sound plural.\nIf a common noun is of these patterns and the middle root letter is not و or ي, and the middle and final root letters are not the same, then the word is modified internally when forming the āt sound plural.\nThere are two separate rules to consider:\n\nIf a common noun is of the pattern فَعْل faɛl or فَعْلَة faɛlah, then the sukūn on the middle letter shall be converted to an fat·ḥah ◌َ when forming the āt sound plural. For example:\n\nنَحْلَة naḥlah “a bee” becomes نَحَلَات naḥalāt “bees”, not \\(\\times\\) نَحْلَات naḥlāt.\nضَرْبَة ḍarbah “a strike” becomes ضَرَبَات ḍarabāt “strikes”, not \\(\\times\\) ضَرْبَات ḍarbāt.\nصَفْحَة ṣafḥah “a page” becomes صَفَحَات ṣafaḥāt “pages”, not \\(\\times\\) صَفْحَات ṣafḥāt.\n\nIf the middle root letter is و or ي, or the middle and final root letters are the same then this modification is not done. For example,\n\nجَوْزَة jawzah “a walnut” becomes جَوْزَات jawzāt.\nحَجَّة ḥajjah “a pilgrimage” becomes حَجَّات ḥajjāt.\n\nIf a common noun is of the pattern فِعْل fiɛl, فِعْلَة fiɛlah, فُعْل fuɛl, or فُعْلَة fuɛlah then the sukūn on the middle letter can, optionally, either:\n\nbe retained,\nbe converted to an fat·ḥah, or\nbe converted to the vowel mark on the first letter.\n\nFor example:\n\nظُلْمَة ḍ͡hulmah “a darkness” can become, optionally, either ظُلْمَات ḍ͡hulmāt or ظُلَمَات ḍ͡hulamāt, or ظُلُمَات ḍ͡hulumāt “darknesses”.\nكِسْرَة kisrah “a piece” can become, optionally, either كِسْرَات kisrāt or كِسَرَات kisarāt, or كِسِرَات kisirāt “pieces”.\n\n\nNote that this rule of changing the vowel mark is only true for common nouns. Adjectival nouns on these patterns will retain the sukūn when forming the āt sound plural. So صَعْب ṣaɛb and صَعْبَة ṣaɛbah “a difficult one” become only صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt, not \\(\\times\\) صَعَبَات ṣaɛabāt.\n\n\n10.3.5 Applicability of the āt sound plural\nWe had mentioned that the ūn sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for male intelligent beings. Conversely, the āt is used for both female intelligent beings, and for non-intelligent beings (both masculine and feminine) like animals, inanimate objects, and abstract concepts. Rarely, it is also used for male intelligent beings.",

    "section": "10.4 Conditions for forming the sound plural",
    "text": "10.4 Conditions for forming the sound plural\nMany times, a noun can form both an ūn sound plural and an āt sound plural.  However, there are many nouns that can form only one of the two sound plurals. And many nouns don’t form either sound plural; they only form broken plurals. (We will learn about broken plurals in the next chapter, if Allāh wills.) There are even nouns that can form both sound and broken plurals.\nHere we will learn some of the conditions which a noun needs to satisfy in order for it to form the sound plurals.\n\n10.4.1 Conditions for the ūn sound plural\nThe ūn sound plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for nouns that denote male intelligent beings. These guidelines will help you determine which nouns form the ūn sound plural.\nWe will treat common nouns and adjectival nouns separately.\n\n10.4.1.1 Common nouns\n\nWith very few exceptions (some of which we saw in section @ref(applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural)), common nouns denoting male intelligent beings are disqualified from forming the ūn sound plural if their feminine counterpart is not formed by adding a ة to the masculine noun.  So, غُلَام g͡hulām “a boy” is disqualified from forming a ūn sound plural because its feminine counterpart is جَارِيَة jāriyah “a girl”, not \\(\\times\\) غُلَامَة g͡hulāmah.\nEven if a common noun denotes a male intelligent being and its female counterpart is formed by adding a ة, further conditions are imposed that can restrict its having a ūn sound plural. We will explain these restrictions below:\nWe learned in section @ref(related-nouns-for-male-and-female-animate-beings) that, in terms of their meaning, nouns that denote animate beings are of two kinds:\n\nNouns that have a primitive meaning. That is, their meaning is not derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding ة to the masculine noun):\n\n\n\nArabic word\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\na son\n\n\nطِفْل ṭifl\na child\n\n\nإِنْسَان ʾinsān\na human being\n\n\nحُرّ ḥurr\na free man\n\n\n\nSuch nouns, in general, won’t be expected to form ūn sound plurals, unless the ūn sound plural is explicitly allowed in their dictionary definition.\nNouns that have a meaning that is derived from a verbal or adjectival meaning. Examples (for male intelligent beings whose feminine is formed by adding ة to the masculine noun):\n\n\n\nWord\nDefinition\nūn plural\n\n\n\n\nمُعَلِّم\na teacherm\nمُعَلِّمُونَ\n\n\nمُسْلِم\na Muslimm (one who submits)\nمُسْلِمُونَ\n\n\nكَافِر\na disbelieverm\nكَافِرُونَ\n\n\nلَاعِب\na playerm\nلَاعِبُونَ\n\n\n\nSuch nouns, in general, can be expected to form ūn sound plurals.\n\n\nThe above defintion of primitve and derived nouns, as we have explained it, is somewhat imprecise. For example, the word حُرّ ḥurr (masc.) “a free man” seems to have a meaning that is derived from the adjective “free” and it forms its feminine by adding ة to it thus: حُرَّة ḥurrah (fem.) “a free woman”. Yet it is considered a primitve noun, and thus does not form an ūn sound plural.\n\nOnce you become more familiar with Arabic word patterns, distinguishing between primitive and derived nouns will become clearer, if Allāh wills.\n\n\n10.4.1.2 Adjectival nouns\nIf an adjectival noun forms its feminine by adding the feminine marker ة to the masculine noun, then we may assume that it forms the ūn sound plural.\nMost adjectival nouns satisfy this condition. For example, consider the adjectival noun:\n\nكَبِير kabīr (masc.) “a big one”\n\nIt forms its feminine by adding a ة to the masculine noun, thus:\n\nكَبِيرَة kabīrah (fem.) “a big one”\n\nThe above condition is satisfied; therefore, كَبِير kabīr (masc.) “a big one” forms the ūn sound plural كَبِيرُونَ kabīrūna “big ones”.\nBy the way, it is only the masculine adjectival noun that will form the ūn sound plural. Nouns with a ة are not allowed to form the ūn sound plural.\nWe have come across two patterns on adjectival nouns that don’t form their feminine by adding ة to masculine noun. These are:\n\n2فَعْلَان faɛlān2, whose feminine is on the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ faɛlā2. Example: 2غَضْبَان g͡haḍbān2 (masc.) “very angry” whose feminine is 2غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā2.\n2أَفْعَل ʾafɛal2, whose feminine is on the pattern 2فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ2. Example: 2أَحْمَر ʾaḥmar2 (masc.) “red”, whose feminine is 2حَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ2.\n\nBecause the above two patterns don’t form their feminine by adding ة to the masculine noun, therefore the masculine nouns don’t form the ūn sound plural. We will see in chapter @broken_plurals, if Allāh wills, that they form broken plurals instead.\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Conditions for the āt sound plural\nJust like the ūn plural, there are conditions that should be fulfilled in order for a noun to form an āt plural. We provide the following guidelines to help you determine if a noun can form an āt plural.\n\n10.4.2.1 Nouns that end with a feminine marker\nGenerally, all nouns that end with a feminine marker like ة, اء, and ىٰ are able to form an āt plural.  Examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nāt sound plural\n\n\n\n\nحَسَنَة ḥasanah adj. “a good onef”\nحَسَنَات ḥasanāt\n\n\nحَسَنَة ḥasanah (common noun) “a good deed”\nحَسَنَات ḥasanāt\n\n\nصَدِيقَة ṣadīqah “a friendf”\nصَدِيقَات ṣadīqāt\n\n\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 “a desert”\nصَحْرَاوَات ṣaḥrāwāt\n\n\n2ذِكْرَىٰ d͡hikrā2 “a remembrance”\nذِكْرَيَات d͡hikrayāt\n\n\n\nThe following are exceptions to this general rule, and don’t form āt sound plurals:\n\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَاء which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2أَفْعَل. For example, حَمْرَاء ḥamrāʾ “redf”.\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2فَعْلَان. For example, غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf”.\nThe following exceptional nouns:\n\nأُمَّة ʾummah “a nation”\nأَمَة ʾamah “a female slave”\nشَفَة s͡hafah “a lip”\n\nThere are a few more such nouns, some of which we will introduce later.\n\nAll these exceptional nouns form broken plurals instead of the āt sound plural.\n\n\n10.4.2.2 Nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker\n\nCommon nouns\nCommon nouns that don’t end with a feminine marker will form the āt plural only if they don’t have a broken plural listed in the dictionary. Furthermore, it is preferred if the noun have five or more letters.\n\nحَيَوَان ḥayawān “an animal” forms the āt plural حَيَوَانَات ḥayawānāt “animals”.\nحَمَّام ḥammām forms the āt plural حَمَّامَات ḥammāmāt “bathrooms”. (The doubled م counts as two letters.)\n\n\n\nMasculine adjectival nouns\nMasculine adjectival nouns are permitted to form an āt sound plural, but only when they are applied to non-intelligent beings.\nFor example, if the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb “a difficult one” is applied to “books”, which is the plural of the masculine noun كِتَاب kitāb “a book”, then the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb is permitted to form the āt plural صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt “difficult ones”.\nBy the way, note that both the masculine adjectival noun صَعْب ṣaɛb, and its feminine صَعْبَة ṣaɛbah form the same āt sound plural صَعْبَات ṣaɛbāt.",

Examples:\n\nبِهِمْ bihimā “with them3,m”\nفِيهِنَّ fīhinna “in them3,f”\nإِلَيْهِمْ ʾilayhim “to them3,m”\n\nThe final sukūn on the مْ in the masculine plural pronouns (هُمْ hum, أَنْتُمْ ʾantum, and كُمْ -kum) becomes a ḍammah (هُمُ humu, أَنْتُمُ ʾantumu, andكُمُ -kumu respectively) when followed by a connecting hamzah.

    "section": "10.7 Verbs with plural doers",
    "text": "10.7 Verbs with plural doers\n\n10.7.1 Plural nouns for the doer\nWe learned that the past verb for a masculine doer is on the pattern فَعَلَ. And when the doer is feminine, the ت of femininity is attached to the verb thus: فَعَلَتْ. We have used these verbs with singular and dual doer nouns. The doer noun always comes after the verb and shall be in the raised-state. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu.\n“The boy went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatun\n“A girl went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامَانِ.\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmāni.\n“The boys2 went.”\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatāni.\n“Two girls went.”\nThese same verbs are used when the doer noun is a plural. Examples:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.\nd͡hahaba -lmuɛallimūn.\n“The teacherm3,m went.”\nذَهَبَتْ مُعَلِّمَاتٌ.\nd͡hahabat muɛallimāt.\n“Teachers3,f went.”\n\n\n10.7.2 Plural pronouns for the doer\nWe have already learned the singular and dual doer pronouns. They are repeated here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAbsentee sing. masc.\ninvisible\n“he”\nفَعَلَ faɛala\n\n\nAbsentee sing. fem.\ninvisible\n“she”\nفَعَلَتْ faɛalat\n\n\nAbsentee dual\n◌َا -ā\n“them2”\nmasc.: فَعَلَا faɛalā, fem: فَعَلَتَا faɛalatā\n\n\nAddressee sing. masc.\nتَ -ta\n“youm,2”\nفَعَلْتَ faɛalta\n\n\nAddressee sing. fem.\nتِ -ti\n“youf,2”\nفَعَلْتِ faɛalti\n\n\nAddressee dual\nتُمَا -tumā\n“you2”\nفَعَلْتُمَا faɛaltumā\n\n\nSpeaker sing.\nتُ -tu\n“I”\nفَعَلْتُ faɛaltu\n\n\nSpeaker dual\n–\n“us2”\n–\n\n\n\nNow we will learn the plural doer pronouns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplural participant\nDoer pronoun\nMeaning\nDoer pronoun with verb\n\n\n\n\nAbsentee pl. masc.\nو\n“they3,m”\nفَعَلُوا faɛalū\n\n\nAbsentee pl. fem.\nنَ -na\n“they3,f”\nفَعَلْنَ faɛalna\n\n\nAddressee pl. masc.\nتُمْ -tum\n“youm,3”\nفَعَلْتُمْ faɛaltum\n\n\nAddressee pl. fem.\nتُنَّ -tunna\n“youf,3”\nفَعَلْتُنَّ faɛaltunna\n\n\nSpeaker pl.\nنَا -nā\n“we”\nفَعَلْنَا faɛalnā\n\n\n\nNote the following regarding the plural doer pronouns:\n\nThe تْ of femininity does not attach to the absentee plural feminine doer pronoun نَ -na “they3,f” فَعَلْنَ. Example:\n\nذَهَبْنَ d͡hahabna “they3,f went”\n\nThis is different from the behavior of the absentee dual doer pronoun ◌َا -ā “them2,f” which, for a feminine doer, does attach to the تْ of femininity. Example:\n\nذَهَبَتَا d͡hahabatā “they2,f went”\n\nThe final sukūn on the مْ in the masculine plural doer pronoun تُمْ -tum becomes a ḍammah تُمُ -tumu when followed by a connecting hamzah. Examples:\n\nأَكَلْتُمْ خُبْزًا.\nʾakaltum k͡hubzā.\n“You3,m ate some bread.”\nأَكَلْتُمُ ٱلْخُبْزَ.\nʾakaltumu -lk͡hubz.\n“You3,m ate the bread.”\n\nThe absentee plural masculine verb doer pronoun “they3,m” و ū is written with a silent alif after it which is written only and not pronounced. This alif is dropped when a direct doee pronoun is attached. For example:\n\nضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.\nḍarabu -rrajul.\n“They3,m hit the man.\nضَرَبُوهُ.\nḍarabūh.\n“They3,m hit him.”\n\nThe plural masculine verb doer pronoun for the addressed person “you3,m” تُمْ -tum becomes تُمُو tumū when a direct doee pronoun is attached. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\nḍarabtumu -rrajul.\n“You3,m hit the man.”\nضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.\nḍarabtumūh.\n“Youpl. masc. hit him.”\n\nThe plural speaking participant doer pronoun نَا -nā is the same as the plural speaking participant attached pronoun نَا -nā. But you can tell them apart because the doer pronoun, when attached to the verb, causes the final letter of the verb to have a sukūn. Consider the following two sentences:\nسَأَلْنَا.\nsaʾalnā.\n“We asked.”\nسَأَلَنَا.\nsaʾalanā.\n“He asked us.”\n\n\n\n\n10.7.3 Sentence word order with plural doers\nAs we’ve mentioned, the doer, whether a noun or a pronoun, always comes after the verb. Here are a couple of examples of verbal sentences with plural doers:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nd͡hahaba -lmuɛallimūna ʾilā madrasah.\n“The teachers3,m went to a school.”\nذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nd͡hahabā ʾilā madrasah.\n“They3,m went to a school.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibati -ṣṣadīqātu fi -lbayt.\n“The friends3,f played in the house.”\nلَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nlaɛibna fi -lbayt.\n“They3,f played in the house.”\nThe above verbal sentences with plural doers can be rearranged to be a subject-comment sentences. This gives more emphasis to the subject. In this case, the verb shall follow the subject and will need a doer pronoun after it.\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَةٍ.\nʾalmuɛallimūna d͡hahabū ʾilā madrasah.\n“The teachers3,m, they3,m went to a school.” = “The teachers3,m went to a school.”\nٱلصَّدِيقَاتُ لَعِبْنَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ.\nʾaṣṣadīqātu laɛibna fi -lbayt.\n“The friends3,f, they3,f played in the house.” = “The friends3,f played in the house.”\nIf there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer in a verbal sentence, the doer noun will follow the first verb and the rest of the verbs will have doer pronouns. For example:\nأَكَلَ ٱللَّاعِبُونَ وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.\nʾakala -llāɛibūna was͡haribū wad͡hahabū.\n“The players3,m ate and they3,m drank and they3,m went.”\n= “The players3,m ate and drank and went.”\nThe above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a subject-comment sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have doer pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the subject of the sentence.\nٱَللَّاعِبُونَ أَكَلُوا وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.\nʾallāɛibūna ʾakalū was͡haribū wad͡hahabū.\n“The players3,m, they3,m ate and they3,m drank and they3,m went.”\n= “The players3,m ate and drank and went.”\nSimilarly,\nأَكَلَتِ ٱللَّاعِبَاتُ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.\nʾakalati -llāɛibātu was͡haribna wad͡hahabn.\n“The players3,f ate and they3,f drank and they3,f went.”\nand\nٱَللَّاعِبَاتُ أَكَلْنَ وَشَرِبْنَ وَذَهَبْنَ.\nʾallāɛibātu ʾakalna was͡haribna wad͡hahabn.\n“The players3,f, they3,f ate and they3,f drank and they3,f went.”\n= “The players3,f ate and drank and went.”\n\n\n\n10.7.4 Verbs with multiple doers mentioned individually\nIf there are multiple doers of a verb, and each is mentioned individually, then there is often more than one way to handle them. Here we will give the more common usage.\nIf the verb is followed by multiple doers, only the first is the true doer with respect to modifying the verb according to its gender and number. Examples:\nذَهَبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْغُلَامُ.\nd͡hahabati -lʾummu wa-lg͡hulāmu.\n“The mother and the boy went.”\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ وَٱلْأُمُّ .\nd͡hahaba -lg͡hulāmu wa -lʾummu.\n“The boy and the mother went.”\nIf the doers consist of different persons (speaking person, addressed person, and absent person), then they are placed in order of strength: The speaking person is stronger than the addressed person, who is stronger than the absent person. The verb doer pronoun of the first (true) doer is then used. Example:\nذَهَبْتُ أَنَا وَأَنْتَ وَهُوَ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾana waʾanta wahuwa.\n“I, you, and he went.”\nNote how the speaking person detached pronoun أَنَا ʾana is used in addition to the doer pronoun تُ -tu in order to add وَ wa “and” to it.\nIf the sentence is a subject-comment sentence, and the verb is in the comment, then the doer pronoun corresponding to the number of the subject is used. Examples:\nأنْتَ وَهُوَ ذَهَبْتُمَا.\nʾanta wahuwa d͡hahabtumā.\n“You1,m and he, you2 went.”\nأَنَا وَمُحَمَّدٌ ذَهَبْنَا.\nʾana wamuḥammadun d͡hahabnā.\n“I and Muḥammad, we went.”\n\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ذَهَبَتَا.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatu d͡hahabatā.\n“The mother and the girl went.”\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ ذَهَبْنَ.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatāni d͡hahabna.\n“The mother and the two girls, they3,f went.”\nIf the doers consist of both male and female persons, then the verb will have the masculine doer prenoun corresponding to the number of the doers. Example:\nٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ وَٱلْغُلَامُ ذَهَبُوا.\nʾalʾummu wa-ljāriyatu wa-lg͡hulāmu d͡hahabū.\n“The mother, the girl, and the boy, they3,m went.”",

    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter we introduced sound plurals, which are formed by appending suffixes to the singular noun. The singular noun in these plurals remains, more or less, intact when forming these plurals. The sound plurals correspond to English regular plurals which are formed by appending “s” to the singular noun. However, English has some plurals that are not formed by adding the plural ending “s”. Here are some examples,\nIn these plurals, the singular noun is altered to form the plural.\nArabic also forms such plurals. They are called broken plurals because the singular noun is not kept intact but its structure is, in most cases, altered, or “broken-up” when forming the plural.\nWhile English only forms such plurals for a handful of nouns, Arabic forms broken plurals for many nouns.",

    "section": "11.2 Review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns",
    "text": "11.2 Review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns\nBefore we begin our discussion about broken plurals, we will do a quick review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns. This will, if Allāh wills, facilitate the explanation of broken plurals.\nMost words in Arabic are formed from three letter roots. We use the paradigm root فعل to show word patterns. For example, the noun رَجُل rajul “a man” is formed from the root رجل on the pattern فَعُل faɛul.\nMost nouns in Arabic are fully-flexible. This means that, when indefinite, they are tanwīned and the indefinite lowered-state is shown by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ at the end of the noun. For example, رَجُل rajul “a man” and بَيْت bayt “a house” are fully-flexible nouns. So, you can see, below, that they are tanwīned, and the indefinite lowered-state is indicated by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ:\nذَهَبَ رَجُلٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.\nd͡hahaba rajulun ʾilā bayt.\n“A man went to a house.”\nSome nouns are semi-flexible. This means that they are not tanwīned, and also, the indefinite lowered-state is indicated by an fat·ḥah ◌َ. Examples of such nouns are:\n\n2غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā2 adj. (fem.) “a very angry onef” from the root غضب\n2صَحْرَاء ṣaḥrāʾ2 (fem.) “a desertf” from the root صحر\n\nذَهَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ غَضْبَىٰ إِلَىٰ صَحْرَاءَ.\nd͡hahabat jāriyatun g͡haḍbā ʾilā ṣaḥrāʾ.\n“A very angry girl went to a desert.”\nWhen definite, semi-flexible nouns are identical to fully-flexible nouns:\nذَهَبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْغَضْبَىٰ إِلَى ٱلصَّحْرَاءِ.\nd͡hahabati -ljāriyatu -lg͡haḍbā ʾila -ṣṣaḥrāʾ.\n“The very angry girl went to the desert.”\nAll nouns that have the endings اء and ىٰ, that are extrinsic to the word’s root, are semi-flexible. اء and ىٰ are also feminine markers for singular nouns, just like ة. (Except that ة does not, in general, make a noun semi-flexible.)\nIt is important to note that ة, اء, and ىٰ are only feminine markers for singular nouns. We will see that they are also endings for broken plural nouns and, in that case, they are not feminine markers. However, اء and ىٰ, when endings for broken plural nouns, will make the broken plural nouns semi-flexible, just as they do for singular nouns.\nNouns that are of the patterns فَفَافِف and فَفَافِيف are also semi-flexible nouns. Here each letter ف could be any letter of the alphabet. These are patterns for broken plurals, as we will see very soon. We had mentioned this in section @ref(fafafif-diptote).\nThis concludes our short review of word patterns and semi-flexible nouns. We will use these concepts in our discussion of broken plurals.",

We will expand on this in a subsequent section.\nSome patterns of the broken plural are also patterns singular nouns. For example, the pattern فِعَال fiɛāl has both singular nouns, like كِتَاب kitāb “a book” and broken plurals, like رِجَال rijāl “men”\nThe broken plural patterns فِعْلَان fiɛlān and فُعْلَان fuɛlān are fully-flexible nouns. Although they end with the ان ending which is extrinsic to the root, they are not semi-flexible nouns. Only singular adjectival nouns that end with an extrinsic ان on the pattern فَعْلَان, and that also fulfil the other conitions listed in section @ref(adjectival noun-an-diptote), are semi-flexible.\nThere is often a correlation between the pattern of a singular noun and the pattern of its plural.\nSometimes this correlation is very strong:\n\nAll singular nouns of the patterns 2أَفْعَل ʾafɛal2 and 2فَعْلَاء faɛlāʾ that denote colors and physical characteristics, have broken plurals on the pattern فُعْل fuɛl. Example:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\n2أَحْمَر, 2حَمْرَاء “red”\nحُمْر\n\n\n2أَبْكَم, 2بَكْمَاء “mute”\nبُكْم\n\n\n\nSingular nouns that have four or more consonant letters (excluding ة) regularly form their broken plurals on the patterns 2فَفَافِف and 2فَفَافِيف. The pattern 2فَفَافِيف is used when there is an intermendiate long vowel between the consonants. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nإِصْبَع “a finger”\n2أَصَابِع\n\n\nمِفْتَاح “a key”\n2مَفَاتِيح\n\n\n\nSingular nouns of the patterns فِعْلَة fiɛlah and فُعْلَة fuɛlah regularly form their broken plurals on the pattern فِعَل fiɛal and فُعَل fuɛal respectively. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nقِطْعَة “a piece”\nقِطَع\n\n\nرُكْبَة “a knee”\nرُكَب\n\n\n\n\nOther times, this correlation is more like a tendency:\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَعِيلَة faɛīlah tend to form broken plurals on the pattern 2فَعَائِل faɛāʾil2. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nحَدِيقَة “a garden”\n2حَدَائِق\n\n\nحَقِيبَة “a bag”\n2حَقَائِب\n\n\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَاعِل fāɛil, that denote male intelligent beings, tend to form broken plurals on the pattern فُعَّل fuɛɛal, فُعَّال fuɛɛāl, and فَعَلَة faɛalah. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nغَائِب “absent”\nغُيَّب\n\n\nقَارِئ “a readerm”\nقُرَّاء\n\n\nقَاتِل “a killerm”\nقَتَلَة\n\n\n\nSingular nouns on the pattern فَاعِل fāɛil and فَاعِلَة fāɛilah, that don’t denote male intelligent beings, tend to form broken plurals on the pattern فَوَاعِل fawāɛil. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nصَاحِبَة “a companionf”\n2صَوَاحِب\n\n\nعَامِل “a factor”\n2عَوَامِل\n\n\n\nفَارِس fāris “a horseman” with the plural 2فَوَارِس is one of a number of exceptions.\n\nSome words have roots that have the same letter repeated in the root. These are called doubled roots.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord\nPattern\n\n\n\n\nدبّ\nدُبّ “a bear”\nفُعْل\n\n\nحلّ\nمَحَلَّة “a locality”\nمَفْعَلَة\n\n\nأمّ\nإِمَام “a leader”\nفِعَال\n\n\nحقّ\nحَقّ “a truth, a right”\nفَعْل\n\n\nهرّ\nهِرّ “a catm”\nفِعْل\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss doubled roots in detail in chapter @ref(doubled-roots). For now we will mention the following:\n\nThe repeated letter in the word root may get doubled or separated in the word’s pattern. Frequently, the repeated letter may be doubled in the singular, and separated in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nحَقّ “a truth, a right”\nحُقُوق\n\n\nدُبّ “a bear”\nدِبَبَة\n\n\nهِرّ “a catm”\nهِرَرَة\n\n\n\nThe reverse also occurs, where the repeated letter may be separated in the singular, and doubled in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nإِمَام “a leaderm”\nأَئِمَّة\n\n\n\nThe doubled letter may modify the basic word pattern somewhat. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nشدّ\n2أَفْعِلَاء\n\\(\\times\\) 2أَشْدِدَاء\n2أَشِدَّاء\n\n\nحلّ\n2مَفَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) 2مَحَالِل\n2مَحَالّ\n\n\nصمّ\n2أَفْعَل\n\\(\\times\\) 2أَصْمَم\n2أَصَمّ\n\n\n\n\nWe have previously learned that the endings ة, اء, and ىٰ that are extrinsic to the word’s root are feminine markers for singular nouns. These extrinsic endings also occur for broken plurals but there, they are not feminine markers.\nIn fact, in a sort of role reversal, the endings ة in a broken plural tends to indicate that the singular is a masculine noun. And the اء ending is only for broken plurals of male intelligent beings. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nلِسَان “a tongue”\nأَلْسِنَة\n\n\nهِرّ “a catm”\nهِرَرَة\n\n\nأَمِير “a commanderm”\nأُمَرَاء\n\n\nصَدِيق “a friendm”\nأَصْدِقَاء\n\n\n\nThere often exist multiple broken plurals for the same singular noun. Many times, in fact, a singular noun may have a sound plural in addition to one or more broken plurals. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nشَهْر\nأَشْهُر, شُهُور\n\n\nعَيْن\nأَعْيُن, عُيُون, أَعْيَان\n\n\nعَامِل\nعَامِلُونَ, 2عَوَامِل, عَمَلَة, عُمَّال\n\n\n\nWe will discuss how to manage these multiple plurals in a subsequent section.\nOccasionally, multiple singular nouns will share the same broken plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nمَكْتَب “an office”\n2مَكَاتِب\n\n\nمَكْتَبَة “a library”\n2مَكَاتِب\n\n\n\nContext will then tell us which of two meanings is intended.\nThe letters ء, ا, و, and ي are considered weak letters. Words that one or more these weak letters in their roots are called defective words. We will discuss defective words more completely in later chapters, if Allāh wills. For now, we will note the following:\n\nWeak letters often get interchanged with one another when going from a singular to a plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأرخ\nتَأْرِيخ\n2تَوَارِيخ\n\n\nنوق\nنَاقَة\nنُوق\n\n\nثور\nثَوْر\nثِيرَان\n\n\n\nWeak letters can affect surrounding vowels. For example:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nبيض\nفُعْل\n\\(\\times\\) بُيْض\nبِيض\n\n\n\nThe weak letter ي, when followed by the ىٰ ending, usually modifies (in writing) it to an ِʾalif instead. The pronunciation is the same. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nهدي\n2فَعَالَىٰ\n\\(\\times\\) 2هَدَايَىٰ\n2هَدَايَا\n\n\n\nA ي at the end of a word, in some states, gets omitted and replaced by a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ on the preceding letter. This happens even when the ي is extrinsic to the root, and even if the word is semi-flexible (and thus would not normally be tanwīned). Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nWord pattern\nExpected word\nActual word\n\n\n\n\nقضي\nفَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) قَاضِي\nقَاضٍ\n\n\nجري\n2فَوَاعِل\n\\(\\times\\) 2جَوَارِي\n2جَوَارٍ\n\n\nليل\n2فَعَالِي\n\\(\\times\\) 2لَيَالِي\n2لَيَالٍ\n\n\n\nWeak letters can also get omitted in the singular and resurface in the plural. Examples:\n\n\n\nRoot\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأخو\nأَخ\nإِخْوَان, إِخْوَة\n\n\nأمو\nأَمَة\nإِمَاء\n\n\n\n\nIf there are more than four consonant letters in a word, then only four of them are selected to form the broken plural. For example:\n\n\n\nSingular\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nعَنْكَبُوت “a spider”\n2عَنَاكِب\n\n\n\nSome words have individual irrgularities as well and we will discuss them below:\n\nThe word ٱِمْرَأَة and its plural نِسَاء are both irregular and we will discuss them separately in chapter @ref(irregular-nouns).\nThe broken plural 2أَشْيَاء ʾas͡hyāʾ (of the singular noun شَيْء s͡hayʾ “a thing”) is irregular in that it is semi-flexible. Otherwise its pattern أَفْعَال ʾafɛāl is regularly fully-flexible.\nThe broken plural of the singular noun مَلَك malak “an angel” is مَلَائِكَة malāʾikah. It is on the pattern فَعَالِلَة faɛālilah. But it is unusual in that the plural has an extra letter ء that is missing in the singular. This is because the singular has a lesser-used variant: مَلْأَك malʾak that is used to form the plural.\nThe broken plural of the singular noun دِينَار “a dīnār” is 2دَنَانِير. It is on the pattern 2فَعَالِيل. It is irregular in that there are two ن’s in the plural whereas the singular only has one.\nThe root of بِئْر biʾr “a (water) well” is بأر. The pattern of its broken plural is أَفْعَال. Based on its root letters, its plural on this pattern ought regularly to have been أَبْآر ʾabʾār. And this plural exists but is not very commonly used. Instead, in forming the plural, the root letters ب and أ get swapped irregularly, and the more commonly used plural is actually آبَار ’ʾābār.\n\nThere are other words as well with similar irregularities.",

    "text": "11.4 Co-existence of multiple broken plurals\nWe noted that there are often multiple broken plurals for the same singular noun. Many singular nouns even have a sound plural in addition to one or more broken plurals. Here are some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nMeanings\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nجِدَار\na wall\nجُدُر, جُدْرَان\n\n\nشَهْر\na month\nأَشْهُر, شُهُور\n\n\nضَعِيف\na weak onem\nضِعَاف, 2ضُعَفَاء\n\n\nأَمْر\na matter; a command\nأُمُور, 2أَوَامِر\n\n\nعَيْن\nan eye; a (water) spring; an eminent person\nأَعْيُن, عُيُون, أَعْيَان\n\n\nعَامِل\na worker; a labourer; a factor\nعَامِلُونَ, 2عَوَامِل, عَمَلَة, عُمَّال\n\n\n\nWe will deal with the co-existence of sound and broken plurals in the next section. In this section, we will explain the existence of multiple broken plurals, and when one of them is preferred or required to be used over the other. Basically, there could be a few things going on:\n\nSometimes it is more or less optional which of the multiple broken plurals to use. For example, the singular noun جِدَار has two broken plurals: جُدُر, جُدْرَان Either could be used, more or less, interchangeably.\nSometimes, the usage of one of the plurals may be restricted. For example, ضِعَاف and ضُعَفَاء are both broken plurals of the masculine adjectival noun ضَعِيف “a weak onem”. For male intelligent beings, like “weak men”, either of the two plurals could be used. But remember that broken plurals that end with an extrinsic اء ending may only be used for male intelligent beings. So the plural ضُعَفَاء may only be used for male intelligent beings like “men” or “boys”, and not for masculine nouns that denote non-intelligent beings like “lions” or “pens”, etc.\nInterestingly, ضِعَاف is also shared as the broken plural for the feminine adjectival noun ضَعِيفَة “a weak onef”. So it can be used for plurals of feminine nouns, both for female intelligent beings like “women” and “girls”, and for feminie nouns that denote non-intelligent beings like “trees”.\nOther times, the singular has multiple distinct meanings, and each of these distinct meanings is associated with its own broken plural(s). Here are some examples:\n\nThe word أَمْر ʾamr has two distinct meanings, each with it’s own plural:\n\n“a matter”. This has the broken plural أُمُور ʾumūr.\n“a command”. This has the broken plural 2أَوَامِر ʾawāmir2.\n\nThe word عَيْن ʾayn has multiple distinct meanings. There are three main meanings, and they share the broken plural with each other in the following way:\n\n“an eye”. This meaning primarily uses the plural أَعْيُن ʾaɛyun but it may also use the plural عُيُون ɛuyūn, and rarely also the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n“a (water) spring”. This meaning primarily uses the plural عُيُون ɛuyūn but it may also use the plural أَعْيُن ʾaɛyun, and rarely also the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n“an eminent person”. This meaning only uses the plural أَعْيَان ʾaɛyān.\n\nThe word عَامِل ɛāmil has the following meanings and plurals:\n\n“a workerm”. Generally, this has the plural عُمَّال ɛummāl.\n“a labourerm”. This uses the plural عَمَلَة ɛamalah.\n“a factor”. This uses the plural 2عَوَامِل ɛawāmil2.\n\n\nArabic has what are known as plurals of fewness. These are specific patterns that may (sometimes, but not always) be used when the persons or things denoted by the plural are only a few (ten or less) and not many. These patterns are:\n\nفِعْلَة fiɛlah\nأَفْعُل ʾafɛul\nأَفْعَال ʾafɛāl\nأَفْعِلَة ʾafɛilah\n\nFor example:\n\nشَهْر s͡hahr “a month”, plurals: أَشْهُر, شُهُور. The plural أَشْهُر could be used when the number of months are only a few (ten or less), and the plural شُهُور could be used when the number of months are large.\nThe plurals أَعْيُن and عُيُون of the word عَيْن could also possibly be used similarly in this manner for both meanings: “an eye” and “a (water) spring”. (But not for the meaning “an eminent person” which only uses the plural أَعْيَان).\n\nOf course, this distinction only applies when the singular noun has additional plurals, not just one from the above four patterns. If a noun has only one of the about four plural patterns then it may be used indiscriminately and will not indicate any limitation in number.",

The sound plural is then, generally, reserved for certain verbal usages. (We will study these in later chapters, if Allāh wills.)\nSo, for example, قَتَلَة is preferred over قَاتِلُونَ generally for the meaning: “killers”.\n\n\n11.5.2 āt plurals and broken plurals\nāt plurals are used for both female intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings. We will discuss each of these separately.\n\n11.5.2.1 Female intelligent beings\nRemember from section @ref(conditions-for-the-at-plural) that, generally, all nouns that end with feminine markers (ة, اء, and ىٰ) can form the āt sound plural.\nThere are some nouns that are excepted from this statement. These nouns only have broken plurals and don’t form sound plurals. For female intelligent beings, these nouns are:\n\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَاء which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2أَفْعَل. For example, حور حَوْرَاء ḥawrāʾ “a beautiful eyed onef” uses the broken plural حُور ḥūr\nAdjectival nouns of the pattern 2فَعْلَىٰ which is the feminine of the masculine adjectival noun pattern 2فَعْلَان. For example, غضب غَضْبَىٰ g͡haḍbā “very angryf” uses the broken plural غِضَاب g͡hiḍāb.\nThe following exceptional nouns:\n\nٱِمْرَأَة “a woman”, broken plural: نِسَاء\nأَمَة “a slavef”, broken plural: إِمَاء\nأُمَّة “a nation”, broken plural: أُمَم\n\n\nIn the case of these nouns we have no choice but to use the broken plural.\nFor other nouns that denote female intelligent beings, the use of the āt sound plural is preferred over any broken plurals that the noun may have.\nSo, for example, the use of the āt sound plural صَغِيرَات is preferred over the broken plural صِغَار for the adjectival noun صَغِيرَة “a small onef”. However, both are permitted.\nThe following are excepted from this general statement:\n\nأُنْثَىٰ “a female”, plural: إِنَاث. The āt sound plural is almost unused for this word.\nBroken plurals of the patterns:\n\n2فَوَاعِل fawāɛil2\n2فَعَائِل faɛāʾil2\n\nThese broken plural patterns are, in fact, predominantly used for female intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings, and only rarely for male intelligent beings. So the broken plural 2جَوَارٍ “girls” may be used freely as the plural of جَارِيَة “a girl” and is not preferred over by جَارِيَات. Similarly, 2صَوَاحِب may freely be used as the plural of صَاحِبَة.\nOnly a few nouns denoting male intelligent beings have broken plurals on these patterns, like:\n\nفَارِس “a horseman”, plural: 2فَوَارِس\nخَلِيفَة “a successor”, plural: 2خَلَائِف\n\n\nIn conclusion, with the general preference of using the āt sound plural over the broken plural for female intelligent beings, you will find that نِسَاء nisāʾ “women” is the only widely found broken plural for female intelligent beings in normal usage.\n\n\n11.5.2.2 Non-intelligent beings\nFor non-intelligent beings, the broken plural is preferred for use over āt sound plurals.\nSo, for example, 2حَدَائِق ḥadāʾiq2 is preferred over حَدِيقَات ḥadīqāt as the plural of حَدِيقَة, though both are correct.",

    "section": "11.6 Usage of plurals",
    "text": "11.6 Usage of plurals\nThe treatment of plurals in sentences is quite complicated. Here we will give a simplified explanation that should suffice for basic usage, until we give a fuller treatment in (TODO: give chapter reference).\nWe will discuss the plurals of intelligent beings and non-intelligent beings separately.\n\n11.6.1 Plurals of intelligent beings in descriptive noun-phrases\nConsistent with what we have learned so far, when the describee in a noun-phrase is plural, then the describer comes after it, and matches it in state, definiteness, gender, and number.\nEither or both of the describer and the describee may be sound plurals or broken plurals.\nHere are some examples:\nلَعِبَ ٱلطِّفْلُ ٱلصَّغِيرُ مَعَ ٱلْغِلْمَانِ ٱلْكِبَارِ.\nlaɛiba -ṭṭiflu -ṣṣag͡hīru maɛa -lg͡hilmāni -lkibār.\n“The small child played with the big boys.”\nأَخَذَ ٱلتِّلْمِيذُ ٱلْعِلْمَ عَنِ ٱلْمُعَلِّمِينَ ٱلْكِرَامِ.\nʾak͡had͡ha -ttilmīd͡hu -lɛilma ɛani -lmuɛallimīna -lkirām.\n“The pupil took knowledge from the noble teachers.”\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ صَوَاحِبُ طَيِّبَاتٌ.\nliljāriyati ṣawāhibu ṭayyibāt.\n“The girl has good companionsf.”\nفِي ٱلسُّوقِ تُجَّارٌ صَادِقُونَ.\nfi -ssūqi tujjārun ṣadiqūn.\n“In the market are honest traders.”\nخَدَمَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلصَّالِحُ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْفُقَرَاءَ ٱلضِّعَافَ مِنَ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ ٱلصِّغَارِ.\nk͡hadama -rrajulu -ṣṣāliḥu -lg͡haniyyu -lfuqarāʾa -ḍḍiɛāfa mina -lyatāmā -ṣṣig͡hār.\n“The rich righteous man served the weak poor ones from the little orphans.”\n\n\n11.6.2 Plurals of intelligent beings in subject-comment sentences\nIf the subject of a sentence is a plural denoting intelligent beings then the comment typically matches it in being a plural. This is especially the case if the comment is an adjectival noun. For example:\nٱلْغِلْمَانُ أَطْفَالٌ طَيِّبُونَ.\nʾalg͡hilmānu ʾaṭfālun ṭayyibūn.\n“The boys are good children.”\nٱَلرِّجَالُ أَغْنِيَاءُ.\nʾarrijālu ʾag͡hniyāʾ.\n“The men are rich.”\nٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ عَالِمَاتٌ.\nʾalmuɛallimātu ɛālimāt,\n“The teachersf are scholarsf.”\nSometimes the comment may not match the subject in plurality because of the meaning of the sentence. For example:\nٱَلْمُسْلِمُونَ أَمَّةٌ.\nʾalmuslimūna ʾummah.\n“The Muslims are a nation.”\nٱَلْجِيرَانُ ٱلطَّيِّبُونَ نِعْمَةٌ مِنَ ٱللَّـٰهِ.\nʾaljīrānu -ṭṭayyibūna niɛmatun mina -llāh.\n“Good neighbors are a blessing from Allah.”\n\nThe use of detached pronouns is consistent with what we learned in section @ref(detached-plural-pronouns). Examples:\nأَنْتُنَّ نِسَاءٌ كَرِيمَاتٌ.\nʾantunna nisāʾun karīmāt.\n“You3,f are generous women.”\nأَنْتُمْ شُبَّانٌ شُجْعَانٌ.\nʾantum s͡hubbānun s͡hujɛānun\n“Youm,3 are courageous young men.”\nٱَلشَّيَاطِينُ هُمُ ٱلْمَلَاعِنُ.\nʾas͡hs͡hayāṭīnu humu -lmalāɛīn.\n“The devils are the accursed ones.”\nهُنَّ نِسَاءٌ غَنِيَّاتٌ.\nhunna nisāʾun g͡haniyyāt.\n“They3,f are rich women.”\nنَحْنُ غِلْمَانٌ أَصْدِقَاءُ.\nnaḥnu g͡hilmānun ʾaṣdiqāʾ.\n“We are boys who are friends.”\n\n\n11.6.3 Plurals of intelligent beings with verbs\nWe have already studied verbs with sound plurals in section (ref). The same discussion applies to broken plurals as well. Here are a couple of examples:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلنِّسَاءُ وَكَتَبْنَ.\nqaraʾati -nnisāʾu wakatabn.\n“The women read and wrote.”\nٱَلْغِلْمَانُ لَعِبُوا بِكُرَةٍ حَمْرَاءَ.\nʾalg͡hilmānu laɛibū bikuratin ḥamrāʾ.\n“The boys, they played with a red ball.”\nطَبَخَتِ ٱلنِّسَاءُ طَعَامًا لِلرِّجَال فَأَكَلُوهُ وَشَكَرُوهُنَّ.\nṭabak͡hati -nnisāʾu ṭaɛāman lirrijāli faʾakalūhu was͡hakarūhunn.\n“The women prepared some food for the men, so they3,m ate it and they3,m thanked them3,f.\nظَلَمَ ٱلْجَبَابِرَةُ ٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَقَتَلُوهُمْ.\nḍ͡halama -ljabābiratu -lmasākīna waqatalūhum.\n“The tyrants wronged the needy ones3,m and killed them3,m.”\n\n\n11.6.4 Usage of plurals of non-intelligent beings\nWe now turn our attention to plurals of non-intelligent beings. The treatment of plurals of non-intelligent beings is very different from everything we have learned so far. In this basic, simplified, explanation: regardless of the grammatical or physical gender of the singular noun, plurals of non-intelligent beings are treated, for the purposes of matching adjectival nouns and pronouns, as grammatically feminine singular.\n\n\nSo, for example, the noun بَيت bayt denotes the inanimate object “a house”. It’s plural is بُيُوت. This plural is treated as a feminine singular noun. This is despite the fact that the singular noun بَيْت bayt “a house” is grammatically masculine. See how the بُيُوت buyūt is used in the examples below:\nٱَلْبُيُوتُ كَبِيرَةٌ.\n “The houses are big.”\nسَكَنُوا فِي بُيُوتٍ صَغِيرَةٍ.\n “They3,m lived in small houses.”\nسَقَطَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ.\n“The houses fell.”\nٱَلْبُيُوتُ سَقَطَتْ.\n “The houses, they fell.”\nهِيَ بُيُوتٌ لِلْفُقَرَاءِ.\n “They are houses for the poor.”\nPlurals of inanimate objects and animals (both male and female) are treated the same way. It doesn’t matter what the grammatical or physical gender of the singular is or whether it has a sound or broken plural. Examples:\nهِيَ ثِيرَانٌ وَحْشَةٌ.\n “They are wild bulls.”\nٱَلْهِرَرَةُ شَرِبَتِ ٱلْحَلِيبَ.\n “The catsm, they drank the milk.”\nٱَلْهِرَرُ شَرِبَتِ ٱلْحَلِيبَ.\n “The catsf, they drank the milk.”\nٱَلسُّفُنُ طَوِيلَة.\n “The ships are tall.”\nفِي ٱلصُّنْدُوقُ أَشْيَاءُ عَجِيبَةٌ.\n “In the box are wonderful things.”\n(Note how 2أَشْيَاء is indefinite but is not tanwīned. This is because it is irregularly semi-flexible.)\nBy the way, this rule only applies to adjectival nouns in the describee or the comment. A common noun in the describer or comment will continue match the describee or subject in gender and number.\nFor example, if you say:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هِيَ ٱلْحَسَنَةُ.\n“The righteous acts are the good ones.”\nthen حَسَنَة may only be the feminine adjectival noun “a good one”.\nIf instead you want to use حَسَنَة with its common noun meaning of “a good deed”, then you have the use the plural:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هِيَ ٱلْحَسَنَاتُ.\n“The acts are the good deeds.”\nThe plural هِي may continue to be used instead of هُنَّ, although the latter is also valid:\nٱَلْأَفْعَالُ ٱلصَّالِحَةُ هُنَّ ٱلْحَسَنَاتُ.\n“The acts are the good deeds.”\nSimilarly, if an adjectival noun connoting a non-intelligent being is used not as a describer or an comment in a sentence, then it should be pluralized to indicate plurality.\nٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ صَغِيرَةٌ وَكَبِيرَةٌ. ٱَلْكَبِيرَاتُ وَحْشَةٌ.\n“The animals are big and small. The big ones are wild.”\nIn the second sentence above, we could not have said (for the same meaning):\n\\(\\times\\) ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ صَغِيرَةٌ وَكَبِيرَةٌ. ٱَلْكَبِيرَةُ وَحْشَةٌ.\n\nIt is important to note that treating non-intelligent beings as grammatically feminine is only for the plural. Singular and dual nouns for non-intelligent beings are treated according to the gender of singular noun, as we have learned in previous chapters. So, for example,\nٱَلْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ.\n“The house is big.”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ٱَلْبَيْتُ كَبِيرَة.\nأَكَلَ ٱلْأَسَدَانِ ٱلظَّبْيَ.\n“The lions2 ate the gazelle.”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) أَكَلَتِ ٱلْأَسَدَانِ ٱلظَّبْيَ.",

    "section": "12.4 Definiteness of the annexation",
    "text": "12.4 Definiteness of the annexation\nConsider again the annexation expression we have been using so far:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\n“the boy’s book”\nThe base noun ٱَلْغُلَام is definite because it is prefixed by ٱَلْ “the”. Therefore we have translated it as “the boy”. The annexe noun كِتَاب is not made definite by ٱَلْ. Nor is it made indefinite by tanwīn.  Rather, its definiteness is determined by the base noun. Because the base noun ٱَلْغُلَام is definite, therefore the annexe noun كِتَاب is also definite. The entire annexation is definite. \nConsider now the case when the base noun is indefinite.\nكِتَابُ غُلَامٍ\n“a boy’s book”\nIn the above example, the base noun غُلَامٍ is indefinite because it is tanwīned and because it does not prefixed by ٱَلْ. Therefore we have translated it as “a boy”. The annexe noun كِتَاب is neither tanwīned, nor does it have ٱَلْ. Its definiteness is, again, determined by the base noun. Because the base noun غُلَامٍ is indefinite, therefore the annexe noun كِتَاب is also indefinite. The entire annexation is indefinite.\nWe will see soon, if Allāh wills, why the definiteness of the annexe noun is important.\n\nHere are some examples of definite and indefinite annexations.\nلَبِسَ ٱلطِّفْلُ قَمِيصَ رَجُلٍ.\n“The child wore a man’s shirt.”\nأَخَذَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْجَيْشِ رَايَةَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَرَفَعَهَا.\n“The army’s commander took the king’s flag and raised it.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ.\n“The man sat in a tree’s shade.”\n\n12.4.1 Translating the annexation using “of”\nSo far we have been using the English “’s” to translate the Arabic annexation. Examples:\nبَيْتُ رَجُلٍ\n“a man’s house”\nبَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the man’s house”\nInstead of using “’s” we may use “of” as well. For example:\nبَيْتُ رَجُلٍ\n“a/the house of a man”\nبَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“a/the house of the man”\nNote that the annexe noun “house” may be prefixed with either “a” or “the”. This will depend on what is more natural in English. Often time both will fit. Here are some examples:\nلَبِسَ ٱلطِّفْلُ قَمِيصَ رَجُلٍ.\n“The child wore a/the shirt of a man.”\nأَخَذَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْجَيْشِ رَايَةَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَرَفَعَهَا.\n“The commander of the army took the flag of the king and raised it.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ.\n“The man sat in the shade of a tree.”\nفَتَحَ ٱللِّصُّ شُبَّاكَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَدَخَلَ ٱلْبَيْتَ.\n“The thief opened a/the window of the house and entered the house.”\nIt is important to understand that translating the annexe noun into English with “a” or “the” is purely for the reason of obtaining a natural translation. This does not affect whether or not the annexe noun is grammatically considered definite in Arabic.\nAs we mentioned earlier, the definiteness of the annexe noun in Arabic depends only on the definiteness of the base noun. If the base noun is definite then the annexe noun shall be considered definite as well. And if the base noun is indefinite then the annexe noun shall be considered indefinite as well.\nThe need to maintain this distinction will become apparent in the next section.\nIf the base noun is definite, and it is desired to make the annexe noun grammatically indefinite, then it is necassary to break the annexation, and use a prepositional phrase instead, usually with the preposition لِ, which, here, will mean “of”. Example:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ لِلرَّجُلِ.\n“The boy went to a house of the man.”\nفَتَحَ ٱللِّصُّ شُبَّاكًّا مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَدَخَلَ ٱلْبَيْتَ.\n“The thief opened a window of the house and entered the house.”",

    "text": "12.5 Broken plurals and āt sound plurals in annexations {#broken-plurals-and-at-sound-plurals-in-annexations}\nThere is no special rules for broken plurals and āt sound plurals in annexations. They behave just like singular nouns. Remember only that āt plurals end with ◌ٍ and ◌ِ in the propped-state.

    "section": "12.6 Describers in an annexation",
    "text": "12.6 Describers in an annexation\n\n12.6.1 Describing the base noun\nConsider the following expression:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ\n“the girl’s book”\nNow say that we want to form an descriptive noun-phrase “the small girl’s book”. Basically, we want to describe the base noun ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl” with the adjectival noun صَغِير “a small one”. Here is how we will express this in Arabic:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ ٱلصَّغِيرَةِ\n“the small girl’s book”\nIn the manner we are already familiar with, we place the describer صَغِير “a small one” after the describee ٱَلْجَارِيَة “the girl” and match the describer with the describee in definiteness, state, gender and number (singular, dual, or plural).\nSimilarly, if we had an indefinite annexation, we would get:\nكِتَابُ جَارِيَةٍِ صَغِيرَةٍ\n“a small girl’s book”\nHere are some more examples:\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ فِي حَدِيقَةِ ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The girl played in the garden of the big house.”\nقَرَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ سُورَةَ ٱلْقُرْآنِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ.\n“The boy read the sūrah of the Noble Qurʾān.”\nجَلَسَ ٱلرَّجُلُ فِي ظِلِّ شَجَرَةٍ عَرِيضَةٍ وَسِيعَةٍ.\n“The man sat in the shade of a wide broad tree.”\n\n\n12.6.2 Describing the annexe noun\nConsider, again, the same annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ\n“the girl’s book”\nSay, now, that we want to describe the annexe noun كِتَاب “book” with the adjectival noun صَغِير “a small one”. Normally, nothing can come between the annexe noun and the base noun in an annexation. So, the describer needs to be placed, again, after the base noun. However, this time it will match the annexe noun, not the base noun, in state, definiteness, gender, and number. So we get:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْجَارِيَةِ ٱلصَّغِيرُ\n“the girl’s small book”\nNote how the describer ٱَلصَّغِيرُ matches the annexe noun كِتَابُ in state and gender. Note also how the describer is definite with an ٱَلْ. This is because it is matching the annexe noun كِتَابُ in definiteness. The annexe noun كِتَاب is definite, not with ٱَلْ, but rather because of the definite base noun ٱَلْجَارِيَةِ “the girl”. We’ve already learned this rule in section @ref(definiteness-of-the-annexation) above.\nSimilarly, if we describe the annexe noun كِتَاب in an indefinite annexation, we get:\nكِتَابُ جَارِيَةٍ صَغِيرٌ\n“a girl’s small book”\nThis time the describer صَغِيرٌ is indefinite with a tanwīned ḍammah ◌ٌ. This is because the annexe noun كِتَابُ is indefinite. It is indefinite because base noun جَارِيَةٍ “a girl” is indefinite.\nNow, you might be foreseeing a problem. What if the annexe noun and the base noun have the same gender, and the annexe noun too is in the lowered-state? For example, in the sentence:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The boy went to the big/old man’s house.”\nor\n“The boy went to the man’s big house.”\nHow do we know whether the describer كَبِير is meant to describe the annexe noun بَيْتِ or the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل? The annexe noun بَيْتِ and the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل are both masculine, singular, definite, and in the lowered-state.\nThe answer is that in such cases, context will have to be clear to tell us which of the two meanings is intended. If the context makes it clear then there is no harm in using such a sentence for either of the two meanings. \nAlso, sometimes, the meaning of the describer is such that it will likely apply to only one of the two nouns. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ.\n“The boy went to a noble/generous man’s house.”\nIn the sentence above the describer كَرِيم “noble/generous” is likely to apply to a man, and not to a house.\nIf, however, the context is not clear, and the meaning of the describer can apply to both the annexe noun and the base noun, then the describer is likely to apply to the base noun and not to the annexe noun. So then, this interpretation is more likely:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ ٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ.\n“The boy went to the big/old man’s house.”\nIn order to apply a describer to the annexe noun in such a case, it is better to break the annexation and form a prepositional phrase instead, usually with the preposition لِ, which, here, will mean “of”. Example:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ لِلرَّجُلِ .\n“The boy went to the big house of the man.”\nHere are some more examples:\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ بِكُرَةِ ٱلْغُلَامِ ٱلْحَمرَاءِ.\n“The girl played with the boy’s red ball.”\n(Note that حَمْرَاء feminine to match كُرَة.)\nسَقَطَتْ وَرَقَةُ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ ٱلْخَضْرَاءُ عَلَىٰ مَاءِ ٱلنَّعْرِ ٱلْعَرِيضِ.\n“The green leaf of the tree fell on the water of the broad river.”\n(Note that خَضْرَاء is in the raised-state to match وَرَقَة)\nحَمَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ حَقِيبَةَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ ٱلثَّقِيلَةَ.\n“The boy carried the heavy school-bag.”\n(literally: the heavy bag of the school).\nكَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ عَلَىٰ صَفْحَةِ كِتَابٍ بَيْضَاءَ.\n“The man wrote on the white page of a book.”\n(Note that بَيْضَاءَ is feminine to match صَفْحَة. However, also note that it has an a-mark ◌َ in the lowered-state because it is semi-flexible.)",

It is in the lowered-state because it is preceded by the preposition مِنْ “from”. Nevertheless, it takes an kasrah مِنْ صَحْرَاءِ أَرْضٍ, not an fat·ḥah, which would be incorrect: \\(\\times\\) مِنْ صَحْرَاءَ أَرْضٍ.",

    "text": "12.8 Annexations with more than two nouns\nSo far we have seen annexations with two nouns. Annexations may be arbitrarily long. Here is an example of a noun-chain with more than two nouns:\n\n\nThe above annexation consists of three nouns. It may be divided into two sub-annexations:\n\nمِفْتَاحُ بَابِ “door’s key”. Its annexe noun \\(a_1\\) is مِفْتَاح and its base noun \\(b_1\\) is بَابِ.\nبَابِ ٱلْبَيْتِ “the house’s door”. Its annexe noun \\(a_2\\) is بَابِ and its base noun \\(b_2\\) is ٱلْبَيْتِ.\n\nThe noun بَاب “door” is common to both sub-annexations. It is the base noun of the first sub-annexation مِفْتَاحُ بَابِ “door’s key”. At the same time, it is also the annexe noun of the second sub-annexation بَابِ ٱلْبَيْتِ “the house’s door”.\nOnly the final base noun may have ٱَلْ or be tanwīned. If the final base noun has ٱَلْ (as above) then all the nouns in the annexation are definite.\nAnd if the final base noun is indefinite, as in the example below, then all the nouns in the annexation are indefinite.\nمِفْتَاحُ بَابِ بَيْتٍ\n“a house’s door’s key”\nAll the nouns except the first annexe noun must be in the lowered-state.

    "section": "12.9 Pronouns as base nouns",
    "text": "12.9 Pronouns as base nouns\nConsider the expression:\n“his book”\nThis expression is very similar to the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\n“the boy’s book”\nThe difference is that we would like to replace the base noun ٱَلْغُلَام “the boy” with the pronoun “his”. For this we use the attached pronoun هُ. When we place this pronoun as the base noun, we get:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nThis annexation follows the same rules as the other annexations we have been studying so far:\n\nThe annexe noun may be in any state, depending on its function in the sentence.\nThe base noun is in the lowered-state. But because the base noun is a pronoun, and pronouns are rigid nouns (see section @ref(rigidity-of-pronouns) that don’t change their ending based on their state, therefore it’s lowered-state will not be apparent.\n\nHere are some examples of this annexation used in sentences:\nكِتَابُهُ ثَقِيلٌ.\n“His book is heavy”\nقَرَأَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابَهُ.\n“The man read his book.”\nكَتَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ فِي كِتَابهِ.\n“The teacherm wrote in his book.”\nIf the annexe noun ends with ة then it is converted to a ت when annexing it to an attached pronoun. For example:\nذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَتِهِمْ.\n“They went to their school.”\nHere are some more examples of annexing to the different attached pronouns:\nدَخَلْتَ بَيْتَكَ.\n“You1,m entered your1,m house.”\nأَكَلَتَا طَعَامَهُمَا.\n“They2,f ate their2 food.”\nقَدِمْتُ إِلَىٰ مَدِينَتِكُمْ\n“I have arrived to your3,m city.”\nهُوَ إِمَامُ مَسْجِدِنَا.\n“He is the ʾImām of our mosque.”\nIf the annexe noun is semi-flexible then it gets a ◌ِ in the lowered-state, as we’ve already learned. Example with the semi-flexible broken plural 2حَدَائِق “gardens”.\nلَعِبْنَ فِي حَدَائِقِهِنَّ.\n“They3,f played in their3,f gardens.”\nIf an annexe noun ends with ىٰ then it gets converted to an alif when annexing it to an attached pronoun. Example with 2فَتَاوَىٰ “legal opinions”:\nكَتَبَ تَلَامِذَةُ ٱلشَّيْخِ فَتَاوَاهُ فِي كُتُبِهِمْ.\n“The pupils of the religious scholar wrote down his legal opinions in their books.”\nFor the singular speaker-participant there are two variants for the attached pronoun:\n\nي -ī\nيَ -ya\n\nThe first (ي -ī) is more commonly used. Example:\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابِي\n“I read my book.”\nأَقْلَامِي قَصِيرَة.\n“My pens are short.”\nIf, however, the annexe noun ends in a long vowel or a semi-vowel then (ي -ī) is disallowed and only (يَ -ya) shall be used. Example with the semi-flexible broken plural 2هَدَايَا “gifts”:\nأَعْجَبَتْهُمْ هَدَايَايَ.\n“My gifts pleased them.”\n\n12.9.1 Describers with annexations to pronouns\nConsider the annexation:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nThe annexe noun is كِتَاب and the base noun is the pronoun ه. We would like add a describer to this expression. Remember from section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns) that pronouns are definite nouns. That makes the annexe noun كِتَاب also definite. Therefore, any describer for this annexation will need to be definite too.\nHere is a new rule: Pronouns may not be describees. That is: they are not allowed to have describers. Even in English you may say:\n“The good boy went.”\nbut you can’t say:\n\\(\\times\\) “The good he went.”\nSo, any describers for the annexation must necessarily only describe the annexe noun, not the base pronoun. Example:\nكِتَابُهُ الأَحْمَرُ\n“his red book”\nHere are some more examples:\nكَتَبْتُ بِقَلَمِيَ ٱلْأَسْوَدِ\n“I wrote with my black pen.”\nحَمَلَ غِلْمَانُ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ حَقَائبَهُمُ ٱلثَّقِيلَة إِلَىٰ مَدْرَسَتِهِمُ ٱلْبَعِيدَةِ.\n“The village boys carried their heavy bags to their distant school.”\n(literally: the village’s boys.)",

    "text": "12.10 Duals and ūn sound plurals in annexations {#duals-and-sound-un-plurals-in-annexations}\nWe have already dealt with broken plurals and āt sound plurals in annexations in section @ref(broken-plurals-and-at-sound-plurals-in-annexations).\nIn this section we will deal with duals and ūn sound plurals in annexations.\n\n12.10.1 Duals and ūn sound plurals as base nouns\nAs base noun, duals and ūn sound plurals behave no differently than other nouns. Being base nouns they will be in the lowered-state and this shall be indicated by:\n\n◌َيْنِ -ayni for duals\n◌ِينَ -īna for ūn sound plurals\n\nHere are some examples:\nلَجِئَ ٱلْمَظْلُومُنَ ٱلضُّعَفَاءُ فِي بِلَادِ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ ٱلْآمِنَةِ.\n“The weak wronged ones took refuge in the secure lands of the Muslims.”\nأُخُتُ ٱلْغُلَامَيْنِ ٱلطَّوِيلَيْنِ صَغِيرَةِ.\n“The tall boys’2 sister is little.”\nهِيَ طَالِبَةُ مُعَلِّمَتَيْنِ كَرِيمَتَيْنِ.\n“She is the studentf of noble teachers2,f.”\n\n\n12.10.2 Duals and ūn sound plurals as annexe nouns\nWhen duals and ūn sound plurals are annexe nouns, then their final ن is treated as a sort of tanwīn and is, therefore, deleted before annexing them to a base noun. For example:\nبَيْتَا ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the man’s houses2”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) بَيْتَانِ ٱلرَّجُلِ\nNote, also, that because the base noun ٱَلرَّجُلِ begins with a connecting hamzah ٱ, therefore the long vowel ā at the end of بَيْتَا is pronounced as a short vowel a, thus:\nbayta -rrajuli\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) baytā -rrajuli\nIf the dual annexe noun were in the lowered-state then the final ي gets an kasrah ◌ِ if there is following connecting hamzah. Example:\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيِ ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nqaraʾtu kitābayi -rrajul\n“I read the man’s books2.”\nHere are some more examples including ūn sound plurals:\nمُعَلِّمُو ٱلْغُلَامِ كِرَامٌ.\nmuɛallimu -lg͡hulāmi kirām.\n“The boy’s teachers3 are noble.”\n(Note that there is no silent alif after مُعَلِّمُو as there is after a verb with a plural absentee-participant doer pronoun, e.g. لَعِبُوا “they3,m played”)\nلَعِبَ ٱبْنَا ٱلرَّجُلِ مَعَ لَاعِبِي مَدِينَتِهِمْ.\nlaɛiba -bna -rrajuli maɛa lāɛibī madīnatihim.\n“The man’s sons2 played with the players of their city.”\n\n12.10.2.1 Annexing duals and ūn sound plurals to pronouns\nDuals and ūn sound plurals can be annexed to attached pronouns, and in this case too, they will lose their final ن. Examples:\nمُعَلِّمُونَا طَيِّبُونَ.\n“Our teachers3,m are good.”\nلَعِبَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَةُ مَعَ صَدِيقَتَيْهَا\n“The girl played with her friends2,f.”\nبَيْتَايَ كَبِيرَانِ.\n“My houses2 are big.”\n(Note that only the يَ variant is allowed to be used because of بَيْتَا ending with a long vowel.)\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيَّ\n(Note how كِتَابَيْ + يَ becomes كِتَابَيَّ.)\nThere are also two special cases in this category and we will examine them below:\n\nAnnexing an ūn sound plural to the singular speaker participant pronoun\nWhen an ūn sound plural is annexed to the singular speaker participant pronoun, then again, only the يَ variant can be used. However, in addition, the expression will appear the same regardless of the state of the annexe noun. So for all states (raised-state, propped-state, and lowered-state), we will get:\nمُعَلِّمِيَّ\nWe don’t say \\(\\times\\) مُعَلِّمُويَ for the raised-state. Examples:\nمُعَلِّمِيَّ كِرَامٌ.\n“My teachers3,m are noble.”\n(raised-state)\nسَأَلْتُ مُعَلِّمِيَّ\n“I asked my teachers3,m.”\n(propped-state)\nأَخَذْتُ كِتَابًا مِنْ مُعَلِّمِيَّ\n“I took a book from my teachers3,m.”\n(lowered-state)\n\n\nAnnexing an dual noun to a dual pronoun\n\nWhen a dual noun is to be annexed to a dual pronoun, then the dual annexe noun is often converted to a plural. For example, instead of saying\nنَظَرْتُ إِلَىٰ رَأْسَيْهِمَا “I looked at their2 heads2.”\nit is in fact, more common, to say\nنَظَرْتُ إِلَىٰ رُؤُوسِهِمَا “I looked at their2 heads3.”\nAlthough the former is also correct. This is because the annexation of a dual to a dual is considered burdensome upon the tongue to utter, and so the plural is prefered.",

In this sentence there are two annexe nouns and one base noun.\nIn order to express this in Arabic, we will say:\nقَلَمُ ٱلْغُلَامِ وَكِتَابُهُ\nqalamu -lg͡hulāmi wakitābuhu\n“the boy’s pen and his book” = “the boy’s pen and book”\nNote that the annexation is not broken by the insertion of وَ wa “and”. Rather a second annexation is used and the two are separated by وَ wa “and”. This is the preferred way of expressing such expressions.\nThere is another, less preferred way of expressing this. And this is by breaking the first annexation and inserting وَ wa “and”:\nقَلَمُ وَكِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ\nqalamu wakitābu -lg͡hulāmi\n“the boy’s pen and book”\nThis second method is not considered as eloquent. Some even consider it incorrect. So we advise you to use the first method whenever possible.\n\n12.11.1.1 With pronouns\nIf the base noun in the first annexation is replaced with a pronoun then only the first method is allowed.

    "text": "12.12 Annexation to a sentence\nSo far we have studied the annexation of an annexe noun to a base noun. It is also possible to have an annnexation where the base noun is replaced by a sentence or a clause. For example,\n\n\nThe word يَوْم is the annexe noun and is used as an adverb or time. The entire sentence خَرَجْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ. occupies the place of the base noun. We will study the adverb of time in chapter (give ref), if Allāh wills, where such annexations are common.\nAnnexation to a sentence also occurs besides adverbs.1 For another example, see section (ref to idaafah to a أن يفعلَ).",

    "text": "12.13 Numbers from one to ten\nArabic numbers are complicated and we will treat them more fully in chapter (give ref), if Allāh wills. For now, we will give a short preview of the numbers from one to ten.\n\n12.13.1 The number one\nThe word for the number “one” is وَاحِد wāḥid. It is an adjectival noun and can be used as a describer. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابًا وَاحِدًا.\n“I read one book.”\nAs usual, when the described noun is feminine, then the describer too وَاحِد is feminized:\nأَكَلْتُ تَمْرَةً وَاحِدَةً.\n“I ate one date.”\nOften, as in English, using the number وَاحِد “one” is optional. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابً.\n“I read a book.”\n\n\n12.13.2 The number two\nThe number for “one” وَاحِد is a singular noun. Correspondingly, the number for “two” ٱثْنَانِ it͡hnāni is a dual noun. It too can be used as describer. For example,\nدَخَلَ رَجْلَانِ ٱثْنَانِ.\ndak͡hala rajulāni -t͡hnān\n“Two men entered.”\nIn the the propped-state and lowered-state, it becomes ٱثْنَيْنِ it͡hnayni. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ كِتَابَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ.\nqaraʾtu kitābayni -t͡hnayn\n“I read two books.”\nWhen feminized it becomes ٱثْنَتَانِ it͡hnatāni. For example,\nدَخَلَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ ٱثْنَتَانِ وَأَكَلَتَا تَمْرَتَيْنِ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ.\ndak͡hala jāriyatāni -t͡hnatāni waʾakalatā tamratayni -t͡hnatayn.\n“Two girls entered and ate two dates.”\nAs with وَاحِد “one”, the use of the number two is optional because its meaning is inherent in the dual. For example,\nدَخَلَتْ جَارِيَتَانِ وَأَكَلَتَا تَمْرَتَيْنِ.\ndak͡hala jāriyatāni waʾakalatā tamratayn.\n“Two girls entered and ate two dates.”\n\n\n12.13.3 The numbers from three to ten\nWe saw that the number وَاحِد “one” is a singular noun, and that the number ٱثْنَانِ it͡hnāni “two” is a dual noun.\nSo it should come as no surprise that the numbers three to ten are treated as plural nouns. (We say treated as plurals because they’re not technically plurals. For example, they don’t conform to the broken plural patterns. But let’s not worry about that for now.)\nNow, remember that ة is a feminine marker for singular nouns, but not for plural nouns. In fact, recall that there is almost a role reversal for ة in plural nouns, where it tends to occur for plurals of masculine nouns, and is missing for plurals of feminine nouns. For example, the plural of هِرّ “a male cat” is هِرَرَة, and the plural of هِرَّة “a female cat” is هِرَر, We will now see this role reversal of ة in the numbers three to ten. When a number from 3–10 is used for a masculine noun then it shall have ة and when it is used for a feminine noun then it shall not have ة. Here then are the numbers from 3–10:\n\n\n\nNumber\nMasculine\nFeminine\n\n\n\n\nthree\nثَلَاثَة\nثَلَاث\n\n\nfour\nأَرْبَعَة\nأَرْبَع\n\n\nfive\nخَمْسَة\nخَمْس\n\n\nsix\nسِتَّة\nسِتّ\n\n\nseven\nسَبْعَة\nسَبْع\n\n\neight\nثَمَانِيَة\nثَمَانِي\n\n\nnine\nتِسْعَة\nتِسْع\n\n\nten\nعَشَرَة\nعَشْر\n\n\n\nThe number 10 is irregular in that the masculine number has a fat·ḥah on the ش (عَشَرَة ɛas͡harah). Whereas the feminine number has a sukūn on the ش (عَشْر ɛas͡hr).\nConsistent with the numbers 1 and 2, the numbers from 3–10 may be used as describers. But they are more often used as annexe nouns. As mentioned earlier, we will treat numbers more fully later, if Allāh wills. But here are some examples for now:\nلِلْمَرْأَةِ ثَلَاثَةُ أَبْنَاءٍ وَأَرْبَعُ بَنَاتٍ.\nlilmarʾati t͡halāt͡hatu ʾabnāʾin waʾarbaɛu banāt.\n“The woman has three sons and four daughters.”\nوَضَعْتُ عَشَرَةَ أَقْلَامٍ فِي عَشْرِ حَقِيبَاتٍ.\nwaḍaɛtu ɛas͡harata ʾaqlāmin fī ɛas͡hri ḥaqībāt.\n“I put ten pens in ten bags.”\nThe feminine number ثَمَانِي “eight” has a final weak letter ي. As we will learn in chapter (give ref), this final letter cannot take a kasrah or a ḍammah. For example,\nأَكَلَتْ ثَمَانِي هِرَرٍ ثَمَانِيَ كِسَرَاتٍ مِنَ ٱللَّحْمِ فِي ثَمَانِي سَاعَاتٍ.\nʾakalat t͡hamānī hirarin t͡hamāniya kisarātin mina -llaḥmi fī t͡hamānī sāɛāt.\n“Eight catsf ate eight pieces of meat in eight hours.”",

    "section": "13.2 The five nouns",
    "text": "13.2 The five nouns\nThere are five nouns in Arabic which are irregular in the same basic way. Collectively, they are called “the five nouns”. They behave a little differently from regular nouns in how they display their state. \n\n13.2.1 أَبٌ ʾab, أَخٌ ʾak͡h, and حَمٌ ḥam\nThe first three nouns that we will talk about are:\n\nأَب ʾab “a father” (root: أبو)\nأَخ ʾak͡h “a brother” (root: أخو)\nحَم ḥam “a father-in-law” (root: حمو)\n\nThe final root letter of all three of these nouns is و. However, irregularly, it is omitted in most formations of the word. It does resurface in some cases as we will describe below.\nWithout the final root letter و, these nouns display their state like regular nouns. Here are some examples:\nلِلْجَارِيَةِ أَبٌ كَبِيرٌ وَأَخٌ صَغِيرٌ.\nliljāriyati ʾabun kabīrun waʾak͡hun ṣag͡hīr\n“The girl has an old father and a young brother.”\nضَرَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ أَخًا لَهُ.\nḍaraba -lg͡hulāmu ʾak͡han lahu.\n“The boy beat a brother of his.”\nٱَلْحَمُ وَٱلْأَبُ فِي بَيْتِ ٱلْأَخِ.\nʾalḥamu walʾabu fī bayti -lʾak͡h.\n“The father-in-law and the father are in the brother’s house.”\nWhere the nouns behave irregularly is when they are an annexe noun in an annexation. Then instead of displaying their state with ◌ُ, ◌َ, and ◌ِ, they display their state using the long vowels و ū, ا ā, and ي ī instead. Here are some examples:\nهُوَ أَخُو ٱلْجَارِيَةِ.\nhuwa ʾak͡hu -ljāriyah\n“He is the girl’s brother.” \nسَأَلْتُ أَبَا صَدِيقِي عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾaltu ʾabā ṣadīqī ɛan ʾamr.\n“I asked my friend’s father about a matter.”\n\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ حَمِي ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ḥami -rrajul.\n“I went to the man’s father-in-law’s house.”\nWhen these nouns are annexed to attached pronouns, then in most cases they will behave as above. So, for example,\nأَبُوهُ\nʾabūhu\n“his father” (raised-state).\nأَخَانَا\nʾak͡hānā\n“our brother” (propped-state).\nHowever, if the attached pronoun is ي (for the singular speaker participant), then in that case, the attached pronoun ي attaches to the annexe noun directly, without any intervening long vowel:\n\nأَخِي\nʾak͡hī\n“my brother” (raised-state, propped-state, and lowered-state).\nأَبِي\nʾabī\n“my father” (raised-state, propped-state, and lowered-state).\nحَمِي\nḥamī\n“my father-in-law” (raised-state, propped-state, and lowered-state).\nHere are some more examples in sentences:\nأَخُوهُ طَوِيلٌ وَأَخُوهَا قَصِيرٌ وَأَخِي كَبِيرٌ.\nʾak͡hūhu ṭawīlun waʾak͡hūhā qaṣīrun waʾak͡hī kabīr.\n“His brother is tall and her brother is short and my brother is big.”\nسَأَلَ أَخَاهُمْ وَأَخَانَا.\nsaʾaltu ʾak͡hāhum waʾak͡hānā.\n“I asked theirm,3+ brother and our brother.”\nشَكَرَ أَخِي أَبِي.\ns͡hakara ʾak͡hī ʾabī.\n“My brother thanked my father.”\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَخِيهِنَّ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ʾak͡hīhinn.\n“I went to theirf,3+ brother’s house.”\nThe above irregular behavior of these three nouns is only when they are annexe nouns. When they happen to be base nouns in annexations, then they again they behave like regular nouns and their state is displayed by the short vowel marks ◌ُ, ◌َ, and ◌ِ, when definite, and by tanwīn ◌ٌ, ◌ً, and ◌ٍ, when indefinite. . Examples:\nبَيْتُ ٱلْأَخِ كَبِيرٌ.\nbaytu -lʾak͡hi kabīr.\n“The brother’s house is big.”\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَخٍ.\nd͡hahabtu ʾilā bayti ʾak͡h.\n“I went to a brother’s house.”\nWhen these nouns form their duals and plurals, then the final root letter و is resurfaces. In forming the broken plural, the final root letter و, being a weak letter, sometimes converts to a ء. The following table shows their duals and plurals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nDual (raised-state)\nDual (propped-state and lowered-state)\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nأَب ʾab\nأَبَوَانِ ʾabawāni\nأَبَوَيْنِ ʾabawayni\nآبَاء ʾābāʾ\n\n\nأَخ ʾak͡h\nأَخَوَانِ ʾak͡hawāni\nأَخَوَيْنِ ʾak͡hawayni\nإِخْوَة ʾik͡hwah, إِخْوَان ʾik͡hwān\n\n\nحَم ḥam\nحَمَوَانِ ḥamawāni\nحَمَوَيْنِ ḥamawayni\nأَحْمَاء ʾaḥmāʾ\n\n\n\nOne special note regarding the dual أَبَوَانِ/أَبَوَيْنِ: in addition to meaning “two fathers”, they can also mean “both parents”, i.e., “a father and a mother”. Here are examples of these words in sentences:\nذَهَبَ ٱلْأَخَوَانِ إِلَى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\nd͡hahaba -lʾak͡hawāni fi -lmasjidi.\n“The brothers2 went to the mosque.”\nسَأَلْتُ أَخَوَيَّ عَنْ أَمْرٍ\nsaʾaltu ʾak͡hawayya ɛan ʾamrin.\n“I asked my brothers2 about a matter.”\nشَكَرْتُ لِأَبَوَيْهِ\ns͡hakartu liʾabawayhi.\n“I thanked his parents.”\n\n\n13.2.2 ذُو d͡hū and ذَات d͡hāt\nThe fourth irregular noun from “the five nouns” is the masculine noun ذُو d͡hū and its feminine counterpart ذَات and d͡hāt. The words ذُو d͡hū and ذَات d͡hāt mean “owner of” or “possessor of”.\nSo, for example, ذُو ٱلْمَالِ d͡hu -lmāli means “possessorm of wealth” or “wealthy personm”. The singular, dual, and plural of ذُو d͡hū in all three states is shown in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nSingular\nDual\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nذُو d͡hū\nذَوَا d͡hawā\nذَوُو d͡hawū\n\n\npropped-state\nذَا d͡hā\nذَوَيْ d͡haway\nذَوِي d͡hawī\n\n\nlowered-state\nذِي d͡hī\nsame as propped-state\nsame as propped-state\n\n\n\nThe noun ذُو d͡hū and its duals and plurals are only ever used as annexe nouns in annexations. Furthermore, they may not be annexed to pronouns. Here are some examples:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ ذُو ٱلْمَالِ.\nʾarrujulu d͡hu -lmāl.\n“The man is the possessor of wealth.” = “This man is wealthy.”\nThe word ذَات is the feminine of ذُو. When used as an annexe noun, its states, duals, and plurals are as in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nSingular\nDual\nPlural\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nذَاتُ d͡hātu\nذَوَاتَا d͡hawātā\nذَوَاتُ d͡hawātu\n\n\npropped-state\nذَاتَ d͡hāta\nذَوَاتَيْ d͡hawātay\nذَوَاتِ d͡hawāti\n\n\nlowered-state\nذَاتِ d͡hāti\nsame as propped-state\nsame as propped-state\n\n\n\nExamples:\nهَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةُ ذَاتُ ثَمَرٍ كَثِيرٍ.\nhād͡hihi -s͡hs͡hajaratu d͡hātu t͡hamarin kat͡hīrin.\n“This tree is the possessor of much fruit.” = “This tree is very fruitful.”\nAs opposed to ذُو which is only an annexe noun, ذَات may be used a noun in its own right. In this case it means “personality” or “essence”. This usage is often found in theological or philosophical works. And, as such, unlike ذُو which can’t be annexed to attached pronouns, ذَات can be annexed to attached pronouns. Examples:\n\n\n13.2.3 فَم fam\nThe fifth of “the five nouns” is فَم fam “a mouth”. It is the most irregular of “the five nouns”.\nIn some ways, the word فَم fam is regular. It is only irregular when it is a singular annexe noun. Let’s first see its regular bahavior.\nعَلَى ٱلْوَجْهِ فَمٌ وَفِي ٱلْفَمِ لِسَانٌ.\nɛala -lwajhi famun wafi -lfami lisān\n“On the face is a mouth, and in the mounth is a tongue.”\nIt is a base noun in an annexation regularly:\nنَطَقَ لِسَانُ ٱلْفَمِ.\nnaṭaqa lisānu -lfam.\n“The mouth’s tongue articulated [speech].”\nIt forms duals regularly, which are used in annexations regularly\nفَمَا ٱلنَّهْرَيْنِ كَبِيرَانِ.\nfama -nnahrayni kabīrāni.\n“The mouths2 of the rivers2 are big.”\nLet’s now see its irregular behavior.\nWhen فَم is a singular annexe noun, then it is usual for it to follow the example of the rest of the five nouns.\n\nHere is how it will appear as a singular annexe noun in the three states:\n\n\n\nraised-state\npropped-state\nlowered-state\n\n\n\n\nفُو fū\nفَا fā\nفِي fī\n\n\n\nExamples of usage:\nفُو ٱلنَّهْرِ كَبِيرٌ.\nfu -nnahri kabīr.\n“The mouth of the river is big.”\nفُوهَا جَمِيلٌ.\nfūhā jamīl.\n“Her mouth is beautiful.”\nفَتَحَ فَاهُ.\nfataḥa fāh.\n“He opened his mouth.”\nجَعَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لُقْمَةَ طَعَامٍ فِي فِي ٱبْنَتِهَا.\njaɛalati -lʾummu luqmata ṭaɛāmin fī fi -bnatihā.\n“The mother put a morsel of food in her daughter’s mouth.”\nWhen the attached pronoun for the speaking person ي is attached to فُو fū, فَا fā, or فِي fī the combination is always فِيَّ fiyya in all three states. Examples:\nفِيَّ مَفْتُوحٌ.\nfiyya maftūh.\n“My mouth is open.”\nفَتَحْتُ فِيَّ.\nfataḥtu fiyy.\n“I opened my mouth.”\nأَكَلْتُ بِفِيَّ.\nʾakaltu bifiyy.\n“I ate with my mouth.”\nIn addition to the above irregular behavior, it is permissible, but less common, to treat فَم regularly as an annexe noun in an annexation. So it is permissible to also say:\nفَمُ ٱلنَّهْرِ كَبِيرٌ.\nfamu -nnahri kabīr.\n“The river’s mouth is big.”\nفَمِي مَفْتُوحٌ.\nfamī maftūhun.\n“My mouth is open.”\nفَمُهَا جَمِيلٌ.\nfamuhā jamīlun.\n“Her mouth is beautiful.”\nفَتَحَ فَمَهُ.\nfataḥa famahu.\n“He opened his mouth.”\nجَعَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لُقْمَةَ طَعَامٍ فِي فَمِ ٱبْنَتِهَا.\njaɛalati -lʾummu luqmata ṭaɛāmin fī fami -bnatihā.\n“The mother put a morsel of food in her daughter’s mouth.”\n\nThe other irregularity of فَم fam “a mouth” is that its broken plural is أَفْواه ʾafwāh.\nNote that the letter م has not been used to form the broken plural, and instead a و, and a ه are used to form it.",

    "section": "13.3 Other irregular nouns",
    "text": "13.3 Other irregular nouns\nThere are more nouns that have irregularity in their own ways. We will discuss them below.\n\n13.3.1 أُولُو ʾulū and أُولَات ʾulāt\nأُولُو ʾulū (first syllable has a short vowel with a silent و) means “peoplem of”. It is only used as a masculine plural annexe noun, similar in meaning to ذَوُو d͡hawū which we discussed in section @ref(zu) above. There is no singular or dual of this noun.\nHere is its form in the different states:\n\n\n\nraised-state\na-and lowered-state\n\n\n\n\nأُولُو ʾulū\nأُولِي ʾulī\n\n\n\nExample:\nلِأُولِي ٱلْأَرْحَامِ حُقُوقٌ.\nliʾuli -lʾarḥāmi ḥuqūq.\n“The people of the wombs (i.e. blood relatives) have rights.”\nThe feminine counterpart of أُولُو ʾulū is أُولَات ʾulāt “women of”. The first syllable again has a short vowel with a silent و.\n\n\n\nraised-state\na-and lowered-state\n\n\n\n\nأُولَاتُ ʾulātu\nأُولَاتِ ʾulāti\n\n\n\nلِأُولَاتِ ٱلْحَمْلِ حُقُوقٌ عَلَىٰ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ.\nliʾulāti -lḥamli ḥuqūq ɛalā buɛūlatihinn.\n“The women of pregnancy (i.e. pregnant women) have rights upon their husbands.”\n\n\n13.3.2 أُمّ ʾumm\nThe noun أُمّ ʾumm “a mother” forms two āt sound plural variants:\n\nأُمَّهَات ʾummahāt\nأُمَّات ʾummāt\n\nThe first variant أُمَّهَات ʾummahāt is more commonly used. Example:\nأُمَّاهَاتُ ٱلْغِلْمَانِ طَيِّبَاتٌ.\nʾummahātu -lg͡hilmāni ṭayyibāt.\n“The boys’ mothers are good.”\n\n\n13.3.3 سَنَة sanah\nThe noun سَنَة sanah “a year” forms both an āt sound plural and an ūn sound plural. (Remember from section @ref(applicability-of-the-un-sound-plural) that a few nouns that don’t denote male intelligent beings have ūn sound plurals.)\nIn both plurals, the singular noun is modified irregularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nāt sound plural\nūn sound plural (raised-state)\nūn sound plural (propped-state and lowered-state)\n\n\n\n\nسَنَة sanah\nسَنَوَات sanawāt\nسِنُونَ sinūna\nسِنِينَ sinīna\n\n\n\nEither of the two plurals may be used interchangeably. Here are some examples:\n\n\n13.3.4 مَاء māʾ\nمَاء māʾ “a water” forms its broken plural irregularly: مِيَاه miyāh “waters”.\n\n\n13.3.5 شَفَة s͡hafah\nشَفَة s͡hafah “a lip” forms its broken plural irregularly: شِفَاه s͡hifāh “lips”.\nAlso, despite ending in the feminine marker ة, it does not form an āt sound plural.\n\n\n13.3.6 ٱِبْن ʾibn, ٱِبْنَة ʾibnah, and بِنْت bint\nThe noun ٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” is from the root بنو. It has two feminine counterparts:\n\nٱِبْنَة ʾibnah\nبِنْت bint\n\nwhich mean “a daughter”.\nٱِبْن ʾibn “a son” forms both a broken plural and an ūn sound plural.\nIts broken plural is أَبْنَاء ʾabnāʾ “sons”.\nIn forming the ūn sound plural, the singular noun is modified irregularly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingular\nūn sound plural (raised-state)\nūn sound plural (propped-state and lowered-state)\n\n\n\n\nٱِبْن ʾibn\nبَنُونَ banūna\nبَنِينَ banīna\n\n\n\nThe feminine ٱِبْنَة and بِنْت “a daughter” form the irregular āt sound plural بَنَات banāt “daughters”. Note that بَنَات banāt is not a broken plural from the root بنت. Therefore, it obeys the rules of āt sound plurals and does not end with ◌َ or ◌ً in the propped-state.\nHere are some examples using these nouns:\n\n\n\n13.3.7 نَاس nās, and أُنَاس ʾunās\nنَاس nās and أُنَاس ʾunās are from the root أنس. They both mean “a people”.\nWhen indefinite, only أُنَاس ʾunās tends to be used, and نَاس nās tends to be unused.\nWhen definite, only ٱَلنَّاس ʾannās tends to be used, and ٱَلْأُنَاس ʾalʾunās is unused.\nHere are some examples using these nouns:\n\n\n13.3.8 The nouns ٱِمْرَأ and ٱِمْرَأَة\nThe nouns ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ (masc.) “a man, a person” and ٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah (fem.) “a woman” are quite irregular.\nFirstly, ٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah “a woman” is, from the perspective, of its meaning, the feminine counterpart of رَجُل rajul “a man (male human being)”.\nٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ, on the other hand, only means “a man” in a general sense. For example, in the sentence “A man is only as good as his word.” It can also be translated as “a person”.\nSecondly, ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ “a man, a person” has no plural. نَاس/أُنَاس “a people” and قَوْم “a population” may be used when a plural is required.\nٱِمْرَأَة ʾimraʾah “a woman” irregularly forms the broken plurals نِسَاء nisāʾ and نِسْوَة niswah “women”. The former (نِسَاء nisāʾ) is more commonly used.\nLike شَفَة s͡hafah it also, despite ending in the feminine marker ة, does not form an āt sound plural.\nThirdly, both nouns are very irregular in how they become definite nouns with ٱَلْ. When ٱَلْ is prefixed to these nouns to make them definite, they lose the initial connecting hamzah and change their internal vowels. This table shows what we mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nDefinite of ٱِمْرَأ\nDefinite of ٱِمْرَأَة\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nٱَلْمَرْءُ ʾalmarʾu\nٱَلْمَرْأَةُ ʾalmarʾatu\n\n\npropped-state\nٱَلْمَرْءَ ʾalmarʾa\nٱَلْمَرْأَةَ ʾalmarʾata\n\n\nlowered-state\nٱَلْمَرْءِ ʾalmarʾi\nٱَلْمَرْأَةِ ʾalmarʾati\n\n\n\nThe masculine noun ٱِمْرَأ ʾimraʾ has an additional irregularity. When it is indefinite, it irregularly displays its state, not only on its final letter ء, but also on the letter before it ر.\nIt is also permissible for it to behave regularly by displaying its state on its final letter only, but this is not as commonly used.\nThis table shows what we mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nRegular indefinite (less common)\nIrregular indefinite (more common)\n\n\n\n\nraised-state\nٱِمْرَأٌ ʾimraʾun\nٱِمْرُؤٌ ʾimruʾun\n\n\npropped-state\nٱِمْرَءًا ʾimraʾan\nٱِمْرَءًا ʾimraʾan\n\n\nlowered-state\nٱِمْرَأٍ ʾimraʾin\nٱِمْرِئٍ ʾimriʾin\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of these nouns:",

    "section": "14.4 Flexibility of proper nouns",
    "text": "14.4 Flexibility of proper nouns\nIn this section we will discuss the flexibility of proper nouns. For now, we will deal only with proper nouns that do not begin with ٱَلْ. In terms of their flexibility, proper nouns consist of two types:\n\nFully-flexible proper nouns.\nSemi-flexible proper nouns.\n\nWe will treat each of them below.\n\n14.4.1 Fully-flexible proper nouns\n\nFor names that don’t begin with ٱَلْ, the default assumption is that they are fully-flexible, unless they fall into one of the categories of semi-flexible nouns (which we will study soon).\nExamples of fully-flexible names are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nمُحَمَّد\nMuḥammad\nمُعَاذ\nMuɛād͡h\n\n\nنُوح\nNūh\nسَعْد\nSaɛd\n\n\nشُعَيْب\nS͡huɛayb\nعَمَّار\nƐammār\n\n\nعَلِيّ\nƐalī\nحَسَّان\nḤassān\n\n\nزَيْد\nZayd\nسَعِيد\nSaɛīd\n\n\nأَنَس\nAnas\nأُحُد\nUḥud (a mountain)\n\n\n\nThese are all masculine names.\nExamples of sentences with fully-flexible proper nouns:\nزَيْدٌ غُلَامٌ طَيِّبٌّ.\nzaydun g͡hulāmun ṭayyib\n“Zayd is a good boy.”\nشَكَرَ أَنَسٌ عَلِيًّا.\ns͡hakara ʾanasun ɛaliyyā.\n“Anas thanked Ɛalī.”\nلَبِسَ سَعِيدٌ قَمِيصَ نُوحٍ ٱلأَخْضَرَ.\nlabisa saɛīdun qamīṣa nūḥini -lʾak͡hḍar.\n“Saɛīd wore Nūḥ’s green shirt.”\n\n\n14.4.2 Semi-flexible proper nouns\nThe rules for the semi-flexibility of proper nouns are a little different from the rules for the semi-flexibility of common nouns and adjectival nouns that we learned in chapter @ref(semi-flexible-nouns). Proper nouns shall be semi-flexible if they fall under one of the categories below. Note that the categories are not mutually exclusive. That is: some semi-flexible proper nouns will fall into more than one category.\n\n14.4.2.1 Names ending with ة\nAll names ending with ة shall be semi-flexible. This rule is specific to proper nouns. We have already seen that common nouns and adjectival nouns that end ith ة are fully-flexible.\nMost such proper nouns are feminine names. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2خَدِيجَة\nK͡hadījah\n2مَيْمُونَة\nMaymūnah\n\n\n2فَاطِمَة\nFaṭimah\n2صَفِيَّة\nṢafiyyah\n\n\n2عَائِشَة\nƐāʾis͡hah\n2خَوْلَة\nK͡hawlah\n\n\n2سُمَيَّة\nSumayyah\n2جَمِيلَة\nJamīlah\n\n\n2حَفْصَة\nḤafṣah\n2آسِيَة\nĀsiyah\n\n\n\nHowever, some masculine names may end with ة too:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2حَمْزَة\nḤamzah\n2مُعَاوِيَة\nMuɛāwiyah\n\n\n2أُسَامَة\nUsāmah\n2عِكْرِمَة\nƐikrimah\n\n\n2طَلْحَة\nṬalḥah\n2عُبَادَة\nƐubādah\n\n\n\nExample:\nطَلْحَةُ ٱلْطَّوِيلُ بَعْلُ جَمِيلَةَ ٱلْكَرِيمَةِ.\n“The tall Ṭalḥah is the husband of the generous Jamīlah.”\n\n\n14.4.2.2 Names ending with an extrinsic اء or ىٰ\nSimilar to common nouns and adjectival nouns, all names ending with an extrinsic اء or ىٰ shall be semi-flexible. These are usually feminine names. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2أَسْمَاء\nAsmāʾ\n2لَيْلَىٰ\nLaylā\n\n\n2دَرْدَاء\nDardāʾ\n2سَلْمَىٰ\nSalmā\n\n\n\nExamples in sentences:\nذَهَبَتْ سَلْمَىٰ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَسْمَاءَ.\n“Salmā went tp Asmāʾ’s house.”\nSentence word order is usually pretty flexible. For stylistic reasons, it is permissible for a direct doee to precede the doer. For example,\nسَأَلَتْ دَرْدَاءَ أَسْمَاءُ.\n“Asmāʾ asked Dardāʾ”\nBut because words that end with ىٰ never display any state, then for these words the sentence word order becomes more rigid. So the following sentence:\nسَأَلَتْ لَيْلَىٰ سَلْمَىٰ.\nwould usually only mean “Laylā asked Salmā.”\n\n\n14.4.2.3 Names ending with an extrinsic ان\nAll names ending with an extrinsic ان will be semi-flexible.\nThis is somewhat different from the rule we learnt for common noun and adjectival nouns in section @ref(adjectival noun-an-diptote). There only adjectival nouns of the pattern فَعْلَان and whose feminine was not formed by adding ة to it were considered semi-flexible nouns.\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2عُثْمَان\nƐut͡hmān\n2رَمَضَان\nRamaḍān\n\n\n2سُفْيَان\nSufyān\n2شَعْبَان\nS͡haɛbān\n\n\n\nExample:\nجَلَس عُثْمَانُ مَعَ سُفْيَانَ فِي رَمَضَانَ.\n“Ɛut͡hmān sat with Sufyān in Ramaḍān.”\n\n\n14.4.2.4 Names on the pattern أَفْعَل\nAll names on the pattern أَفْعَل shall be semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2أَحْمَد\nAḥmad\n2أَسْعَد\nAsɛad\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2.5 Names of the pattern فُعَل\nNames of the pattern فُعَل shall be semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n\n\n2عُمَر\nƐumar\n2مُضَر\nMuḍar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2.6 Names that are originally verbs\nNames that are originally verbs are semi-flexible. Examples:\n\n2يَزِيد Yazīd “He increases”\n2يَعِيش Yaɛīs͡h “He lives”\n\nTheir origin as verbs will be apparent when we study resembling verbs.\n\n\n14.4.2.7 Names of foreign origin\nNames of foreign origin are generally semi-flexible. These include the names of angels, many of the previous prophets and messengers, and other persons. Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2جِبْرِيل\nJibrīl\n2زَكَرِيَّا\nZakariyyā\n\n\n2إِبْرَاهِيم\nIbrāhīm\n2يَحْيَىٰ\nYaḥyā\n\n\n2إِسْمَاعِيل\nIsmāɛīl\n2هَاجَر\nHājar\n\n\n2إِسْحَاق\nIs·ḥāq\n2مَرْيَم\nMaryam\n\n\n2يَعْقُوب\nYaɛqūb\n2يَأْجُوج\nYaʾjūj\n\n\n2يُوسُف\nYūsuf\n2مَأْجُوج\nMaʾjūj\n\n\n2يُونُس\nYūnus\n2إِبْلِيس\nIblīs\n\n\n2إِدْرِيس\nIdrīs\n2فِرْعَون\nPharoah\n\n\n2أَيُّوب\nAyyūb\n2هِرْقَل\nHeraclius\n\n\n2مُوسَىٰ\nMūsā\n2كِسْرَىٰ\nChosroes\n\n\n2عِيسَىٰ\nƐīsā\n2قَيْصَر\nCaesar\n\n\n\nNote that 2فِرْعَون “Pharoah” as 2قَيْصَر “Caesar”, despite being titles, are treated as proper names.\nThe only exception to this rule is a masculine name of foreign origin that comprises of only three letters, and whose middle letter has an sukūn. Such a name will be fully-flexible. Example:\n\nنُوح Nūḥ\n\n\n\n14.4.2.8 Feminine names\nAll feminine names, regardless of their origin, or their ending, shall be semi-flexible. We have already given examples of semi-flexible feminine names that end with ة, اء, and ىٰ, so we will provide other examples here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2زَيْنَب\nZaynab\n2مَرْيَم\nMaryam\n\n\n2سُعَاد\nSuɛād\n2هَاجَر\nHājar\n\n\n\nThe only exception to this rule is a feminine name of native Arabic origin, that comprises of only three letters, and whose middle letter has an sukūn. Such a name is permitted to be optionally fully-flexible or semi-flexible. Examples:\n\nهِنْد Hind\nدَعْد Daɛd\n\nExample of usage:\nذَهَبَتْ هِنْدٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ دَعْدٍ.\nor\nذَهَبَتْ هِنْدُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ دَعْدَ.\n“Hind went to Daɛd’s house.",

    "section": "14.7 The Replacement",
    "text": "14.7 The Replacement\nBefore we proceed with our discussion on proper nouns, we will take a short digression to discuss a grammatical concept called the replacement. We will only give a short preview here and will treat it fully in chapter @ref(the-replacement-chapter).\nA replacement is a word that follows another word, the replacee, and replaces it from the perspective of the grammar of the sentence. The replacement is put in the same state as the replacee. Here is an example of a sentence with a replacement and a replacee:\n\nIn the above sentence, the word كِتَابًا “a book” is the replacement of شَيْـًٔا “something”. Therefore, it is put in the same propped-state.\nThe replacement is frequently used with proper nouns. For example,\nذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ عَمِّهِ عَلِيٍّ.\n“The boy went to his uncle Ɛalī’s house.”\nIn this sentence, the name عَلِيّ Ɛalī is the replacement of the replacee عَمّ “uncle”. Note, again, that the replacement comes after the replacee and matches it in state. However, the replacement does not need to come directly after the replacee. We can see that there is the pronoun ه “his” between them.\nHere is another example:\nسَأَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ مُعَاذٌ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَ سَعْدًا.\n“The student Muɛād͡h asked the teacher Saɛd.”",

    "section": "14.8 Annexed names",
    "text": "14.8 Annexed names\nSo far we have only dealt with proper nouns that are single words. There are some proper nouns that may be formed from two words that are in an annexation. These belong to different categories:\n\n14.8.1 “Slave of” names\nSome names are formed by annexing the noun عَبْد ɛabd “a slave” to one of the names of Allāh. The most common of these names are:\n\nعَبْد ٱللَّـٰه Ɛabd Allāh “the Slave of Allāh”\nعَبْد ٱلرَّحْمَـٰن Ɛabd al-Raḥmān “the Slave of the Most Merciful”\n\nAs usual, the base noun shall always be in the lowered-state. And the state of the annexe noun عَبْد is variable, depending on it’s function in the sentence. Example:\nعَبْدُ ٱللَّـٰهِ هُوَ أَخُو عَبْدِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ. “Ɛabd Allāh is the brother of Ɛabd al-Raḥmān.”\n\n\n14.8.2 “Parent of” names\nIt is common to call a man, not by his own given name, but rather by calling him the father of one of his children, usually his first born son. For example, if a man named أَحْمَد “Aḥmad” had a son named زَيْد “Zayd”, he may be called أَبُو زَيْد Abū Zayd “Zayd’s father”. Example of usage in a sentence:\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ أَبِي زَيْدٍ.\n“I went to Abū Zayd’s house.”\n(Note how زَيْدٍ has a tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ in the lowered-state because it is fully-flexible.)\nWhile using the name of first-born son is more common, a daughter’s name could be used as well. Example,\nسَأَلْتُ أَبَا رُقَيَّةَ سُؤالًا.\n“I asked Abū Ruqayyah a question.”\n(Note how رُقَيَّةَ has an fat·ḥah ◌َ in the lowered-state because it is semi-flexible.)\nWomen, too, are similarly called as the mother of one of their children. For example, the wife of the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him) 2أُمّ حَبِيبَة Umm Ḥabībah was called thus because she had a daughter named 2حَبِيبَة from a previous marriage. \nBy the way, a person need not literally be a father or a mother to be called in such a way. These names may be applied as nicknames.\nFor example, the Companion of the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him) was called 2أَبُو هُرَيرَة Abū Hurayrah because it is reported that he used to have a pet kitten (هُرَيْرَة). Here is an example of this name in a sentence.\nأَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ صَحَابِيٌّ جَلِيلٌ.\n“Abū Hurayrah is a great Companion.”\n(Note how هُرَيْرَةَ is now considered a semi-flexible proper noun even though it may originally have been derived from the common noun “a kitten”.)\nSimilarly, the Companion أَبُو بَكْرٍ Abū Bakr is not known to have a son named بَكْر.\nIt is often the case that a “parent of” name overtakes the actual given name of person in popularity, and becomes the person’s name for all intents and purposes. Such is indeed the case for the Companions أَبُو بَكْرٍ Abū Bakr and 2أَبُو هُرَيرَة Abū Hurayrah.\n\n\n14.8.3 “Son of” names\nIn a manner similar to “parent of” names, a person may be referred to as the son of his parent. For example, the Companion 2عُمَر Ɛumar had a son named عَبْد ٱللَّـٰه Ɛabd Allāh. He is commonly known as 2ٱِبْن عُمَر Ibn Ɛumar “Ɛumar’s son”.\nAttributing a son to his father is most common. But attributing him to a mother or other ancestor is also possible.\nExamples:\n\nthe Companion عَمَّار was affectionately called 2ٱِبْن سُمَيَّة Ibn Sumayyah “Sumayyah’s son” by the Prophet (may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him). His mother Sumayyah was an early martyr in Islām.\nthe famous scholar ٱِبْن كَثِير Ibn Kat͡hīr is referred to by his grandfather’s name كَثِير Kat͡hīr.\na human being is called 2ٱِبْن آدَم based on his being a descendent of the first man, the Prophet Adam.\n\n\n14.8.3.1 Full names\nThe full name of a person is formed by putting his given name first, and then his “son of” name after it as a replacement. Here is an example of a full name:\nزَيْدُ بْنُ عَلِيٍّ\nZayd the son of Ɛalī\nNote some peculiarities of the full name:\n\nThe name زَيْد “Zayd” has lost its tanwīn.\nThe word بْن “son” is not written with its initial connecting hamzah ٱ.\n\nThese peculiarities are only when forming a full name in this manner. Consider for example the following sentence:\nزَيْدٌ ٱبْنُ عَلِيٍّ.\n“Zayd is the son of Ɛalī.”\nIn the above example, the name زَيْدٌ is tanwīned and ٱبْن is written with its connecting hamzah ٱ. Therefore this is not an expression of the full name in a replacee-replacement format. Rather, ٱبْنُ أَحْمَدَ here is the comment of the sentence.\nFor women, the word بِنْت is used instead of بْن.\nExample:\nقَرَأَتِ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ كِتَابَ ٱلطَّالِبَةِ زَيْنَبَ بِنْتِ أَحْمَدَ.\n“The teacher read the book of the student Zaynab the daughter of Aḥmad.”\nThe names of multiple forefathers may be strung together in this way separated by بْن. For example:\nٱِسْمُ نَبِيِّنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ ٱللَّـٰهِ بْنِ عَبْدِ ٱلْمُطَّلِبِ.\n“Our prophet’s name is Muḥammad the son of Ɛabd Allāh the son of Ɛabd al-Muṭṭalib.”\n(Note that the second بْنِ is in the lowered-state to match the state of the annexe noun عَبْدِ in عَبْدِ ٱللّـٰه.)\nWe will deal with complete full names in section @ref(complete-full-names) below.\n\n\n\n14.8.4 Other annexed names\nOther words besides عَبْد, أَب, أُمّ, and ٱِبْن may be used in annexed names too. Here are some examples:\n\nذُو ٱلْقَرْنَينِ D͡hu l-Qarnayn “He of the two horns”\nمَدِينَة ٱلنَّبِي madinatu -nnabiyyi “The City of the Prophet”, frequently reduced to simply ٱَلْمَدِينَة “al-Madīnah”.\nContext is used to infer whether by ٱَلْمَدِينَة is meant “al-Madīnah” or “the city”.\nٱمْرُؤُ ٱلْقَيْس Imruʾ al-Qays “The man of al-Qays”, a pre-Islāmic poet.",

Sometimes, this is systematic, as we will lear in section @ref(calling-names-with-al).

For example, 2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl is a name of the Prophet 2يَعْقُوب Yaɛqūb. The ūn sound plural بَنُونَ “sons/children” is annexed to the name 2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl to get the name of the tribe 2بَنُو إِسْرَائِيل Banū Isrāʾīl “the children of Isrāʾīl”. In the propped-state and lowered-state, this becomes 2بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل Banī Isrāʾīl.\nNot all tribe names have بَنُونَ “sons” annexed to them, but many do. And often it is optional to keep or drop the annexed بَنُونَ. Examples:\n\nقُرَيْش Qurays͡h usually does not have بَنُونَ annexed to it.\nبَنُو تَمِيم Banū Tamīm may optionally drop the annexed بَنُونَ and be called simply تَمِيم Tamīm.\n\n\n14.11.1 Flexibility of tribe names\nThe flexibility of tribe names depends on the name. Here are some examples:\n\n2إِسْرَائِيل Isrāʾīl is a name of foreign origin and is therefore semi-flexible. Example:\nبَعَثَ ٱللَّـٰهُ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ.\n“Allāh sent Mūsā to the children of Isrāʾīl.”\nقُرَيْش Qurays͡h and تَمِيم Tamīm are native Arabic masculine names and are therefore fully-flexible. Example:\nقُرَيشٌ وَبَنُو تَمِيمٍ قَبِيلَتَانِ.\n“Qurays͡h and Banū Tamīm are tribes2.”\n2هَوَازِن Hawāzin is on the semi-flexible noun pattern 2فَفَافِف and is therefore semi-flexible.\n\n\n\n14.11.2 Gender of tribe names\nTribe names are unusual in that they are treated as both singular feminine and plural masculine. If the tribe name is the doer of a verb then it is usually treated as singular feminine. Otherwise, for example, if it comes before the verb, then the plural masculine pronouns are used for it.\nExample:\nسَكَنَتْ قُرَيْشٌ مَكَّةَ وَعَبَدُوا ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.\n“Qurays͡h dwelled in Makkah and they worshipped idols.”",

For example,\nسَأَلَ رَجُلٌ ٱلْإِمَامَ مَالِكًا عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\n“A man asked Imām Mālik about a matter.”\nIn the above sentence, the title ٱَلْإِمَامَ Imām is a replacee and the name مَالِكًا Mālik is the replacement.\nSome titles are formed from annexations.

For example:\n\nMount Everest\nthe river Nile\nthe city of Damascus\n\nIn Arabic, the titles for these objects usually don’t occur as replacees as they do for persons. Rather, the title is annexed to the proper noun in an annexation.

Duals and plurals are also allowed, again with the same rule:\nيَا رِجَالُ، قَدْ حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ.\nyā rijālu qad ḥadat͡ha ʾamrun.\n“O you men, a matter has occurred.”\nNote how the word رِجَالُ rijālu “men” is not tanwīned because the word is used to call out to the specific persons.\nSimilarly,\nيَا لَاعِبَانِ بَدَأْتُمَا ٱللَّعِبَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُمَا ٱلْعَمَلَ.\nyā lāɛibāni badaʾtuma -llaɛiba wamā faɛaltuma -lɛamal.\n“O you players2, you have started playing and you have not done the work.”\n\n\n15.2.3 Using single word definite common nouns\nWhen using a common noun to call out to a person, especially if the common noun is a title, it is often desired to make the common noun definite with ٱَلْ. In this case, the particle يَا yā is modified to أَيُّهَا ʾayyuhā, or sometimes يَا أَيُّهَا yā ʾayyuhā. Examples:\nيَا أَيُّهَا ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ، قَدْ فَعَلْتُ ٱلْوَاجِبَ.\nyā ʾayyuha -lʾustād͡hu, qad faɛaltu -lwājiba\n“O you the Professor, I have done the obligatory [work].”\nأَنَا سَقِيمٌ أَيُّهَا ٱلطَّبِيبُ.\nʾana saqīmun, ʾayyuha -ṭṭabību.\n“I am ill, O you the Doctor.”\nIf the person being called out to is feminine, then أَيُّهَا ʾayyuhā is modified to أَيَّتُهَا ʾayyatuhā. For example:\nأَيَّتُهَا ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ، هَـٰذَا كِتَابِي.\nʾayyatuha -lmuɛallimatu, hād͡hā kitābi.\n“O you the teacherf, this is my book.”\n\n\n15.2.4 Using multiple words\nThe above discussion pertains to calling out to the addressed person with a single word. Often times a person’s name may consist of multiple words. For example:\n\nعَبْدُ ٱللَّـٰهِ\nɛabdu -llāhi\n“Ɛabd Allāh”\nأَبُو بَكْرٍ\nʾabū bakrin\n“Abū Bakr”\nصَلَاحُ ٱلدِّينِ\nṣalāḥu -ddīni\n“Salāḥ ad-Dīn”\n\nIn this case, then instead of the raised-state, the word is put into the propped-state. Furthermore, the tanwīn, if any, is preserved. Examples:\nمَا عَرَفْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ، يَا عَبْدَ ٱللَّـٰهِ.\nmā ɛaraftu d͡hālika -rrajula, yā ɛabda -llāhi.\n“I have not recognized that man, O Ɛabd Allāh.”\nيَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ، أَنْتَ رَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ.\nyā ʾabā bakrin, ʾanta rajulun karīmun\n“O Abū Bakr, You are a noble man.”\nيَا صَلَاحَ ٱلدِّينِ، صَبَرْتَ فَنَصَرَكَ ٱللَّـٰهُ.\nyā ṣalāḥa -ddīni, ṣabarta fanaṣaraka -llāhu.\n“O Salāḥ ad-Dīn, you were patient so Allāh gave you victory.”\nIf, instead of a personal name, a noun phrase consisting of multiple words is used to call out to a person, then in this case as well, the first noun shall be in the propped-state. Examples:\nيَا أَمِيرَ ٱلْمُؤمِنِينَ، قَدْ حَضَرَ ٱلْقَوْمُ.\nyā ʾamīra -lmuʾminīna, qad ḥaḍara -lqawmu.\n“O Commander of the Believers, the people are present.”\nيَا ٱبْنَ أَخِي، قَدْ سَقَطَ قَلَمُكَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.\nya -bna ʾak͡hī, qad saqaṭa qalamuka.\n“O my nephew, your pen has fallen on the ground.”\nيَا تَلَامِيذَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ، ٱلْعِلْمُ أَمَانَةٌ.\nyā talāmīd͡ha -lmadrasati, -lɛilmu ʾamānatun.\n“O pupils of the school, knowledge is a trust.”\nWhen multiple words are used to call out to a person, the second word in the noun-chain may be a pronoun. Here too, the first noun shall be in the propped-state. Examples:\nيَا أَبانا\nyā ʾabānā\n“O our father”",

    "section": "16.5 The pointing noun phrase",
    "text": "16.5 The pointing noun phrase\nRemember from chapter @ref(adjectival nouns-and-descriptive-noun-phrases) that a descriptive noun-phrase consists of a describer and a describee. The describer follows the describer and matches it in definiteness, state, gender, and number.\nHere is an example of a descriptive noun-phrase in a sentence.\n\nWe will now see how this same descriptive noun-phrase can be used with pointing nouns.\n\n16.5.1 Pointing to a single noun\nWe will first deal with nouns that are single words, like ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ above. In section @ref(pointing-to-an-annexation) below, we will deal with nouns that are part of an annexation, like كِتَابَيِ ٱلرَّجُلِ.\n\n16.5.1.1 The pointed-to noun noun is definite with ٱَلْ\nJust like an adjectival noun, a pointing noun can be a describer in a noun-phrase. But remember from section @ref(definiteness-of-pointing nouns) above that pointing nouns are definite. So, if a pointing noun is a describer in a noun-phrase, the describee has to be definite too. Example:\n\nIn the above example, the pointed-to noun noun ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ is the describee in a descriptive noun-phrase. It is definite, in the propped-state, masculine, and dual.\nThe pointing noun هَـٰذَيْنِ is its describer. It follows the describee and matches it being dual, in the propped-state, masculine, and dual.\nAs a special case, when the pointed-to noun noun has ٱَلْ (as in this case: ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ), then the order of the pointing noun and the pointed-to noun noun is permitted to be reversed. \nThe pointing noun is then a replacee (see section @ref(the-replacement)), and the pointed-to noun noun is its replacement.\nExample:\n\nIn the above example, the pointing noun هَـٰذَيْنِ is a replacee. It is definite, in the propped-state, masculine, and dual.\nThe pointed-to noun noun ٱَلْكِتَابَيْنِ is its replacement. It follows the replacee and matches it being dual, in the propped-state, masculine, and dual.\nAs a matter of fact, even though both orders are permitted, this reverse order of placing the pointing noun first and following it with the pointed-to noun noun is more common.\nHere are some more examples of pointing noun phrases when the pointed-to noun noun is definite with ٱَلْ:\nهَـٰذَا ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ إِمَامٌ.\nٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ هَـٰذَا إِمَامٌ.\n“This noble man is an imām.”\n\n\n16.5.1.2 The pointed-to noun noun is a proper noun\nRemember that proper noun are definite nouns, even though they usually don’t begin with ٱَلْ. For example:\n\n\n\nزَيْد\nZayd\nٱَلْحَارِث\nal-Ḥārit͡h\n\n\n2زَيْنَب\nZaynab\nقُرَيْش\nQurays͡h\n\n\n\nSuch names may also be part of a pointing noun phrase. If they don’t begin with ٱَلْ then only the [pointed-to noun noun first, then pointing noun] order is permitted. Example:\nزَيْدٌ هَـٰذَا أَخُو زَيْنَبَ تِلْكَ.\n“This Zayd is that Zaynab’s brother.”\nقُرَيْشٌ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ سَكَنُوا بِمَكَّةَ.\n“These Qurays͡h dwelled in Makkah.”\nIf the name begins with ٱَلْ then both orders are permitted.\nهَـٰذَا ٱلْحَارِث\nٱلْحَارِث هَـٰذَا\n“this al-Ḥārit͡h”\n\n\n\n\n16.5.2 Pointing to an annexation\nConsider the following expression:\n“the man’s book”\nWe can apply the pointing noun “this” to either “the book” or to “the man” in a pointing noun phrase. So we have two options:\n\n“the book of this man”\n“this book of the man”\n\nSimilarly, consider the following expression:\n“Zayd’s book”\nWe can, again, apply the pointing noun “this” to either “the book” or to “Zayd”:\n\n“the book of this Zayd”\n“this book of Zayd”\n\nIn this section we will learn how to construct these pointing noun phrases in Arabic. Arabic uses annexations to express the above meanings. So we will discuss annexations like:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\nand\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ\n“the book of Zayd”\nNote that both the above annexations are definite because their base nouns are definite.\nIndefinite annexations like كِتَاب رَجُلٍ “a man’s book” cannot be used in pointing noun phrases.\n\n16.5.2.1 The definite base noun begins with ٱَلْ\nWe will first consider annexations where the definite base noun begins with ٱَلْ, like:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\n\n16.5.2.1.1 Pointing to the base noun\nWe would like to express the phrase:\n“the book of this man”\nIn order to point to the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل “the man” with the pointing noun هَـٰذَا “this-onem”, we can put the pointing noun either before or after the base noun, thus:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“the book of this man”\nBoth these pointing noun phrases give the same meaning: “the book of this man”. However, the first phrase كِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ is preferred, consistent with what we learned in section @ref(phrase-single-pointed-to-noun-with-al), above.\nThe second phrase كِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا, although correct, would only rarely be used with this meaning. (In fact, it has another meaning: “this book of the man” which we will learn in section @ref(pointing-to-the-annexe-noun), below.)\nHere is how these phrases could be used in complete sentences:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ جَدِيدٌ.\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا جَدِيدٌ.\n“The book of this man is new.”\nBefore we give more examples, let’s analyze these phrases in detail.\nConsider the first pointing noun phrase:\n\nAs you can see the pointing noun هَـٰذَا has taken the place of ٱَلرَّجُل as the base noun in the annexation. In addition to being the base noun, هَـٰذَا is also a replacee, whose replacement is ٱَلرَّجُل. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the book of this-one: the man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“the book of this man”\nConsider, now, the second pointing noun phrase:\n\nٱَلرَّجُل, here, keeps its place as the base noun in the annexation. In addition to being the base noun, ٱَلرَّجُل is also a describee, whose describer is the pointing noun هَـٰذَا. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the book of the this-one man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“the book of this man”\n\n\n16.5.2.1.2 Pointing to the annexe noun\nConsider, again, the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ\n“the book of the man”\nWe have already discussed how to point to the base noun ٱَلرَّجُل in a pointing noun phrase. Now, we would like to point to the annexe noun كِتَاب in a pointing noun phrase.\nIn other words, we would like to express the meaning:\n“this book of the man”\n\nThe way to express this in Arabic is\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the man”\nBut wait! Didn’t we see in section @ref(pointing-to-the-base-noun) above that this expression has the meaning “the book of this man”?\nIt turns out that this expression supports both meanings.\nBut it will generally only be used for the meaning: “this book of the man”\nIn order to express “the book of this man” we will typically use the expression كِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّجُلِ.\nLet’s analyze the expression كِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا “this book of the man” in detail:\n\nكِتَاب, here, is both and annexe noun and a describee. Its describer is the pointing noun هَـٰذَا. The literal, word-for-word, translation of this phrase is:\n“the this-one book of the man”\nThe more natural translation is:\n“this book of the man”\nHere is this pointing noun phrase in a complete sentence:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا أَخْضَر.\n“This book of the man is green.”\n\nAmbiguity of this phrase\nA quick note about the ambiguity of this expression:\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the man” (usual)\n“the book of this man” (rare)\nThe ambiguity of whether the pointing noun هَـٰذَا points to the annexe noun كِتَابُ or the base noun ٱلرَّجُلِ only exists because the annexe noun and the base noun match each other in gender and number: singular masculine. If the annexe noun and the base noun were different in gender and number, then there would be no ambiguity. Examples:\nكِتَابَا ٱلرَّجُلِ هَـٰذَانِ\n“these books2 of the man”\nكِتَابُ ٱلرَّجُلَيْنِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the men2”\nكِتَابُ ٱلْمَرْأَةِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of the woman”\nكِتَابُ ٱلْمَرْأَةِ هَـٰذِهِ\n“the book of this woman”\nHere are some more examples of pointing to annexe nouns:\n\n\n\n16.5.2.1.3 The base noun is a proper noun beginning with ٱَلْ\nConsider the annexation:\nكِتَابُ ٱلزُّبَيْرِ\n“the book of al-Zubayr”\nWe can apply the preceding discussion of pointing to the annexe noun and base noun to this annexation as well. So we get:\nكِتَابُ هَـٰذَا ٱلزُّبَيْرِ\n“the book of this al-Zubayr”\nكِتَابُ ٱلزُّبَيْرِ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of al-Zubayr” (usual)\n“the book of this al-Zubayr” (rare)\n\n\n\n16.5.2.2 The definite base noun does not begin with ٱَلْ\nConsider, now, that the base noun is definite but does not begin with ٱَلْ. There are two such types of nouns that we will discuss:\n\nProper nouns not beginning with ٱَلْ\nPronouns\n\n\n16.5.2.2.1 The base noun is a proper noun not beginning with ٱَلْ\n\nWe will first deal with proper nouns that don’t begin with ٱَلْ. Consider the annexation:\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ\n“the book of Zayd”\nBecause the base noun زَيْد does not begin with ٱَلْ, any pointing nouns can come only after the entire annexation, thus:\nكِتَابُ زَيْدٍ هَـٰذَا\nIn theory, this supports two meanings:\n\n“this book of Zayd”\n“the book of this Zayd”\n\nIn practice, however, the first meaning (“this book of Zayd”) is much more likely. Pointing to a proper noun in a pointing noun phrase (“the book of this Zayd”) is uncommon, generally.\n\n\n16.5.2.2.2 The base noun is a pronoun\nWe have learned, in section @ref(definiteness-of-pronouns), that pronouns are always definite, despite not beginning with ٱَلْ.\nWe have also learned, in section @ref(pronouns-as-base-nouns), that a pronoun may be a base noun in an annexation. Example:\nكِتَابُهُ\n“his book”\nNeither the annexe noun كِتَاب, nor the attached pronoun هُ begin with ٱَلْ. So if we want to add the pointing noun هَـٰذَا to this annexation to form a pointing noun phrase, then we have to place it at the end, after the annexation, thus:\nكِتَابُهُ هَـٰذَا\nThe pointing noun هَـٰذَا, here, is a describee. But what is its describer?\nWe have also learned, in section @ref(describers-with-annexations-to-pronouns) that pronouns may not be describees in a descriptive noun phrase.\nSo, we are left with only one option: the annexe noun كِتَاب is the desceibee. And the meaning of the phrase is:\nكِتَابُهُ هَـٰذَا\n“this book of his”\n\nHere are some more examples:",

    "section": "16.6 Pointing nouns as subjects",
    "text": "16.6 Pointing nouns as subjects\nBesides their use in pointing noun phrases, pointing nouns are very often used as the subject of a sentence. For example:\n\nThe pointing noun is (usually) made to match the comment in number and gender. Examples:\nهَاتَانِ جَارِيَتَانِ.\n“These are girls2.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ مُعَلِّمُونَ.\n“Those are teachers.”\nهَـٰؤُلَاءِ أَقْلَامٌ.\n“These are pens.”\nتِلْكَ بُيُوتٌ.\n“Those are houses.”\nهَـٰذَانِ صَغِيرَانِ.\n“These are small ones2.”\nThe comment may be a single word (as above) or more complex (as below):\nذَ ٰلِكَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْمُؤِْمِنِينَ.\n“That is the commander of the believers.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ أَكَلْنَ ٱلطَّعَامَ..\n“Those-ones ate3,f the food.”\nهَـٰذَا ثَوْبُ رَجُلٍ.\n“This is a man’s garment.”\nهَـٰذِهِ كُتُبُهُ.\n“These are his books.”\nهَـٰذَانِ بَيْتَانِ كَبِيرَانِ..\n“These are big houses2.”\nIf the comment is a noun that begins with ٱَلْ then it may be placed after the pointing noun subject in the same manner:\n\nWhile the this is permitted and correct, it may be sometimes confused with for the pointing noun phrase “this man”. So, in the same way that we learned in section @ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info), we insert a detached pronoun between the subject and the comment, thus:\nهَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.\n“This is the man.”\nHere are some more examples:\nهَاتَانِ هُمَا ٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ.\n“These are the girls2.”\nأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.\n“Those are the teachers.”\nهَـٰؤُلَاءِ هُنَّ ٱلْأَقْلَامٌ.\n“These are the pens.”\nتِلْكَ هِيَ ٱلْبُيُوتٌ.\n“Those are the houses.”\nهَـٰذَانِ هُمَ ٱلصَّغِيرَانِ.\n“These are the small ones2.”\n\n16.6.1 Mismatched pointing noun subject\nWhen the pointing noun is a subject we usually match its number and gender with the number and gender of the comment, as we have been doing so far. However, when the pointing noun subject refers to a noun in a previous sentence, then we may prefer to match to the previous noun than to the the following comment. Example:\nبَلَغَنَا خَبَرُ ٱلْمَطَرِ عَلَى ٱلْجَبَالِ. ذَ ٰلِكَ بُشْرَىٰ لِلزُّرَّاعِ.\n“The news of the rain on the mountains has reached us. That is a good tiding for the sowers.”\nNote that the second sentence’s subject and comment mismatch:\nذَ ٰلِكَ بُشْرَىٰ\n“That is a good tiding.”\nThe comment بُشٌرَىٰ “a good tiding” is a feminine noun but the subject ذَ ٰلِكَ is masculine. This is because ذَ ٰلِكَ is actually referring to خَبَر in the previous sentence which is a masculine noun.",

So we can have,\n\nكَتَبَ kataba “he wrote”\nعَمِلَ ɛamila “he worked”\nكَبُرَ kabura “he became big”\n\nSimilarly, the vowel on the middle letter in an resembling verb can also vary depending on the verb. Generally, this will need to be looked up in a dictionary and memorized. But there are the following rules which limit the variation:\n\nIf the past verb has an fat·ḥah on the middle letter, the resembling verb’s middle letter can have either an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or an ḍammah, depending on the verb. For example,\n\nكَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ kataba yaktubu “he wrote, he writes”\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ d͡hahaba yad͡h·habu “he went, he goes”\nكَشَفَ يَكْشِفُ kas͡hafa yaks͡hifu “he uncovered, he uncovers”\n\nIf the past verb has an kasrah on the middle letter, the resembling verb’s middle letter will usually have an fat·ḥah. Rarely, for a few verbs, it may be an kasrah instead. For example,\n\nعَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ ɛamila yaɛmalu “he worked, he works”\nحَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ ḥasiba yaḥsibu “he deemed, he deems” \n\nIf the past verb has an ḍammah on the middle letter, the resembling verb’s middle letter shall have a ḍammah. For example,\n\nكَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ kabura yakburu “he grew big, he grows big”\n\n\nIt is possible for some resembling verbs to have more than option for the vowel mark on the middle letter. Both variants give the same meaning for the verb. For example, the past verb حَسِبَ ḥasiba “he deemed” has as its incomplete-verb both يَحْسِبُ yaḥsibu and يَحْسَبُ yaḥsabu.",

    "section": "17.4 Verb state",
    "text": "17.4 Verb state\nAs you know, nouns in Arabic have a state that is determined by the function of the noun in the sentence. For example, consider the following sentence:\nسَأَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلرَّجُلَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ.\nsaʾala -lg͡hulāmu -rrajula ʾan s͡hayʾin.\n“The boy asked the man about something.”\nIn the above sentence, ٱَلْغُلَامُ ʾalg͡hulāmu is the doer of the verb so it is in the raised-state and this is indicated by the ḍammah on its final letter. ٱَلرَّجُلَ ʾarrujala is the direct doee of the verb so it is in the propped-state and this is indicated by the fat·ḥah on its final letter. شَيْءٍ s͡hayʾin is directly preceded by a preposition so it is in the lowered-state and this is indicated by the tanwīned kasrah ◌ٍ on its final letter. The ending of the past verb سَأَلَ is not determined based on the function of the verb in the sentence, and therefore, it does not have any state. (Its ending can change depending on whether a pronoun is attached to it but this is not related to the function of the verb in the sentence and does not represent any state.)\nAs opposed to past verbs, which don’t have any state, resembling verbs do have a state which is determinined by the function of the verb in a sentence. Similar to nouns, the state of an resembling verb is indicated by the vowel mark or suffix at the end of the verb.\nResembling verbs have three states, just like nouns. These states are called:\n\nThe raised-state\nThe propped-state\nThe clipped-state\n\nTwo of the states have their names in common with nouns: the raised-state and the propped-state. The the clipped-state is named differently.\nThe ḍammah on the final letter of يَفُعَلُ yafɛalu indicates that it is in the raised-state. We will study only the raised-state of resembling verbs in this chapter. And we will study the propped-state and clipped-state in later chapters if Allāh wills.",

This is the same behavior as with past verbs. For example:\nيَجْلِسُ ٱلرِّجَالُ وَيَأْكُلُونَ وَيَشْرَبُونَ.\nyajlisu -rrijālu wa yaʾkulūna wa yas͡hrabūna.\n“The men sit and (they) eat and (they) drink.”",

This is by means of the particles سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa that can be placed before the verb. They provide a meaning of “will” or “will soon”. سَـ sa-, being a single letter particle, is attached to the verb.\nFor example,\nسَيَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nsayad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\nand\nسَوْفَ يَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ\nsawfa yad͡h·habu -rrajulu.\n“The man will go.” or\n“Soon the man will go.”\nThe difference in usage of سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa can be thought of as one of emphasis. سَوْفَ sawfa is more emphatic than سَـ sa-.

We will often give a new verb in the format:\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا “to go”\nThe past verb for the singular masculine absentee participant “he”, the corresponding resembling verb, and their maṣdar are given together, in sequence. The maṣdar is given in the propped-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if Allāh wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: “to go”.",

    "section": "18.2 Patterns of the maṣdar for form 1 verbs",
    "text": "18.2 Patterns of the maṣdar for form 1 verbs\nThe patterns of the maṣdar for form 1 verbs are very variable. It is best to learn the maṣdar when you learn a new verb. Having said that, there are some general trends which may be useful to keep in mind:\n\nIf the verb takes a direct doee, then the past verb must necessarily be of the pattern فَعَلَ faɛala or فَعِلَ faɛila (because past verbs of the pattern فَعُلَ faɛula never take a direct doee). In this case:\n\nThe maṣdar for many verbs, in general, tends to be فَعْل faɛl. Examples:\n\nفَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا “to open (هـ s.th.)”\nأَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا “to take (هـ s.th.)”\nحَمِدَ يَحْمَدُ حَمْدًا “to praise (ه s.o.)”\n\n\nIf the verb does not take a direct doee, then:\n\nIf the past verb is of the pattern فَعِلَ faɛila, then:\n\nIf the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the maṣdar tends to be, in general, of the pattern فَعَل faɛal. Examples:\n\nتَعِبَ يَتْعَبُ تَعَبًا “to become tired”\nجَزِعَ يَجْزَعُ جَزَعًا “to be impatient”\nأَسِفَ يَأْسَفُ أَسَفًا “to be sorrowful”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes being a color, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فُعْلَة fuɛlah. Examples:\n\nخَضِرَ يَخْضَرُ خُضْرَةً “to be green”\nسَمِرَ يَسْمَرُ سُمْرَةً “to be brown”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some work or effort, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُول fuɛūl. Example:\n\nقَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ قُدُومًا “to arrive”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some static quality, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُولَة fuɛūlah. Example:\n\nيَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَة “to be dry”\n\n\nIf the past verb is of the pattern فَعَلَ faɛala, then:\n\nIf the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the maṣdar tends to be, in general, of the pattern فُعُول fuɛūl. Examples:\n\nقَعَدَ يَقْعُدُ قُعُودًا “to sit, stay back”\nسَجَدَ يَسْجُدُ سُجُودًا “to prostrate down”\nخَضَعَ يَخْضَعُ خُضُوعًا “to be humble”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes an ailment, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فُعَال fuɛāl. Examples:\n\nسَعَلَ يَسْعُلُ سُعَالً “to cough”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes travelling, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فَعِيل faɛīl. Examples:\n\nرَحَلَ يَرْحَلُ رَحِيلًا “to depart”\n\nIf, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes a sound, then the maṣdar is usually of the pattern فَعِيل faɛīl or فُعَال fuɛāl, or both. Examples:\n\nصَرَخَ يَصْرُخُ صَرِيخًا وَصُرَاخًا “to scream”\n\n\n\nIf the verb denotes a craft or a profession or a rank, then the maṣdar is often of the pattern فِعَالَة fiɛālah. Examples:\n\nتَجَرَ يَتْجُرُ تِجَارَةً “to trade”\nأَمِرَ يَأْمَرُ إِمَارَةً “to be a commander”\n\nIf the past verb is of the pattern فَعُلَ faɛula, then the maṣdar tends to be of the pattern فُعُولَة fuɛūlah or فَعَالَة faɛālah. Examples:\n\nصَعُبَ يَصْعُبُ صُعُوبَةً “to be difficult”\nشَجُعَ يَشْجُعُ شَجَاعَةً “to be brave”\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these are only general trends and there are many verbs that have maṣdars which don’t fall under the above rules.",

    "title": "18  The maṣdar",
    "section": "18.3 Usage of the maṣdar",
    "text": "18.3 Usage of the maṣdar\n\n18.3.1 State and definiteness\nThe maṣdar has properties of a noun, like state and definiteness. But it gives the meaning of a verb. For example, consider the verb أَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا “to eat”. We can use its maṣdar in a sentence like this:\nفَرَغَ زَيْدٌ مِنَ ٱلْأَكْلِ.\nfarag͡ha zaydun mina -lʾakli.\n“Zayd got done with eating.”\nNote how the maṣdar ٱلْأَكْلِ ʾalʾakli gives the meaning of the action of the verb “eating”. But since it is a noun, it obeys the rules for nouns, like being in the lowered-state when preceded by the preposition مِنْ min.\nAnother point worth noting is that we have made it definite by saying ٱَلْأَكْلِ ʾalʾakli instead of saying أَكْلٍ ʾaklin for the meaning of “eating”. This is because, as we explained in section @ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns), the definite noun is usually used in Arabic to give a general meaning, where in English we would not use “the”. This may be a good time to re-read that section.\nHaving said that, the indefnite maṣdar may be used too, and this will give the meaning of “a certain”, or “a specific”. For example, with the verb عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا “to work”, we can say:\nفَرَغَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَعْبٍ.\nfarag͡ha min ɛamalin ṣaɛbin.\n“He got done with a [certain] difficult work.”\n\n\n18.3.2 With a doer\nA doer may be used with the maṣdar to show who is doing the action. In this case, the maṣdar and the doer are usually placed in an annexation. The maṣdar shall be the annexe noun and the doer shall be in the lowered-state as the base noun in the annexation. For example, consider the verb قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ قِرَاءَةً “to read”. We can say:\nسَمِعْتُ قِرَاءَةَ زَيْدٍ.\nsamiɛtu qirāʾata zaydin.\n“I heard Zayd’s reading.”\nThe doer may similarly be a pronoun, in which case, as usual, attached pronouns are used. So we can say:\nسَمِعْتُ قِرَاءَتَهُ.\nsamiɛtu qirāʾatahu.\n“I heard his reading.”\n\n\n18.3.3 With an indirect doee\nIf a verb uses a particular preposition with indirect doees, and the maṣdar of that verb is to be used with an indirect doee, then that same preposition is used with the maṣdar.\nFor example the verb ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا “to go” is used with the preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” with an indirect doee to give the place to which the doer is going. This same preposition is then used with the maṣdar, thus:\nتَعِبْتُ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَابِ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ ٱلْبَعِيدَةِ.\ntaɛibtu mina -d͡hd͡hahābi ʾila -lmadīnati -lbaɛīdati.\n“I became tired from going to the far city.”\nIf a doer is used along with the indirect doee, then the doer shall be placed in a noun chain with the doer participle, as explained in the previous section. For example,\nحَزِنْتُ مِنْ ذَهَابِ زَيْدٌ إِلَىٰ مَدِينَةٍ بَعِيدَةٍ.\nḥazintu min d͡hahābi zaydin ʾilā madīnatin baɛīdatin.\n“I became sad from Zayd’s going to a far city.”\n\n\n18.3.4 With a direct doee\nIf a verb takes a direct doee, and we wish to use the direct doee with the verb’s maṣdar, then we may deal with it in one of three ways:\n\n18.3.4.1 The direct doee in the lowered-state in an annexation with the maṣdar\nIn the first method, the direct doee is in the lowered-state as the base noun in an annexation with the maṣdar. This method is used when the doer of the verbal noun is not mentioned with the maṣdar, or when there is no other phrase between the maṣdar and the direct doee. For example,\nفَرَغَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ قِرَاءَةِ ٱلْكِتَابِ.\nfarag͡ha zaydun min qirāʾati -lkitābi.\n“Zayd got done with reading the book.”\nIn this sentence, ٱَلْكِتَابِ ʾalkitābi “the book” is the direct doee of the maṣdar قِرَاءَةِ qirāʾati “reading”. The doer زَيْدٌ zayd “Zayd” is only mentioned in the beginning of the sentence but not again with the maṣdar. Therefore, the direct doee ٱَلْكِتَابِ ʾalkitābi “the book” is allowed to be put in an annexation with the maṣdar thus: قِرَاءَةِ ٱلْكِتَابِ qirāʾati -lkitābi “reading the book”.\nInstead of a noun, the direct doee may be a pronoun instead. For example,\nقَرَأ زَيْدٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ فَفَرَغَ مِنْ قِرَاءَتِهِ.\nqaraʾa zayduni -lkitāba fafarag͡ha min qirāʾatihi\n“Zayd read the book, and then he got done with reading it.”\nRemember from the previous section, that a doer is handled in the same way with a maṣdar by placing it in an annexation with the maṣdar. So how do we know whether the base noun in an annexation with a maṣdar is a doer or a doee? Well, for many verbs the meaning of the verbal-noun and the noun is sufficient. For example, in the phrase قِرَاءَةِ ٱلْكِتَابِ qirāʾati -lkitābi “reading the book”, the meaning of “reading” makes it clear that ٱَلْكِتَابِ ʾalkitābi can only be a doee, because a book can’t be the one doing the reading.\nBut there are some verbs, however, where the meaning of the verbal-noun itself is not sufficient to tell us whether the noun following it in an annexation is a doer or a doee. Consider the verb  ضَرَبَ يَضْرِبُ ضَرْبًا “to beat (ه s.o.)”. If we form an annexation using its maṣdar, thus: ضَرْبُ زَيْدٍ ḍarbu zaydin, we cannot know whether Zayd is the doer (the one doing the beating), or the doee (the one getting beaten). In this case, we will need more context to help us determine whether Zayd is the doer or the doee. Here are a few sentences that may help illustrate this point:\nضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا. سَمِعَ ٱلْأَبُ ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ فَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ. فَنَدِمَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ ضَرْبِ عَمْرٍو.\nḍaraba zaydun ɛamran. samiɛa -lʾabu ḍarba zaydin fag͡haḍiba ɛalayhi. fa nadima zaydun min ḍarbi ɛamrin.\n“Zayd beat Ɛamr. The father heard Zayd’s beating so he became angry with him. So, Zayd became remorseful of beating Ɛamr.”\nWe can see that the meaning of the sentences help us determine that in the phrase ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ ḍarba zaydin, Zayd is the doer, and in ضَرْبِ عَمْرٍو ḍarbi ɛamrin, Ɛamr is the doee.\n\n\n\n18.3.4.2 The direct doee in propped-state following the maṣdar\nThe second way to deal with a direct doee and a maṣdar is to put it in the propped-state after the maṣdar. This is usually done when the doer is mentioned with the maṣdar in an annexation with it. The direct doee is then placed after the doer in the propped-state. For example, we can re-word the previous example:\n\nضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا. سَمِعَ ٱلْأَبُ ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ عَمْرًا فَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ. فَنَدِمَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ ضَرْبِهِ عَمْرًا.\nḍaraba zaydun ɛamran. samiɛa -lʾabu ḍarba zaydin ɛamran fag͡haḍiba ɛalayhi. fa nadima zaydun min ḍarbihi ɛamran.\n“Zayd beat Ɛamr. The father heard Zayd’s beating Ɛamr so he became angry with him. So, Zayd became remorseful of his beating Ɛamr.”\nNotice that in ضَرْبِهِ عَمْرًا ḍarbihi ɛamran “his beating Ɛamr”, the doer is a pronoun instead of a noun. This is permissible, and is in line with other usages we have learned so far.\nThe doee noun in the propped-state, too, may be replaced with a pronoun, but just like when the attached doee pronoun is separated from its verb it has to instead be attached to the prefix إِيَّا ʾiyyā, here too this prefix is used. For example,\nأَلِمَ عَمْرٌو مِنْ ضَرْبِ زَيْدٍ إِيَّاهُ.\nʾalima ɛamrun min ḍarbi zaydin ʾiyyāhu.\n“Ɛamr was in pain from Zayd’s beating him.”\nThis usage of putting the direct doee in the propped-state after the maṣdar is not only done when the doer is mentioned with the maṣdar. But it is also done when the direct doee is separated from the maṣdar by some other words, like a prepositional phrase. For example,\nفَرَغْتُ مِنَ ٱلْقِرَاءَةِ فِي ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ كِتَابًا.\nfarag͡htu mina -lqirāʾati fi -lmaktabati kitāban.\n“I got done with reading, in the library, a book.”\nThe prepositional phrase فِي ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ fi -lmaktabati in the above example is placed between the maṣdar and the doee for effect. It could, of course, also have been placed after the doee, in a more normal fashion. In this case, it would be preferred for the maṣdar and the doee to be placed in an annexation, in the manner we have already learned.\nفَرَغْتُ مِنْ قِرَاءَةِ كِتَابٍ فِي ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ .\nfarag͡htu min qirāʾati kitābin fi -lmaktabati.\n“I got done with reading a book in the library.”\n\n\n18.3.4.3 The direct doee in lowered-state preceded by the preposition لِ li\nThe third way to deal with a direct doee and a maṣdar is to put it in the lowered-state preceded by the preposition لِ li. This is usually done in one of the following scenarios:\n\nWhen the maṣdar is indefinite and immediately precedes the direct doee. Example:\nفَرَغْتُ مِنْ قِرَاءَةٍ لِلْكُتُبِ.\nfarag͡htu min qirāʾatin lilkutubi.\n“I got done with a reading of the books.”\nThis sentence can be used to indicate one particular instance of reading the books. As opposed to saying قِرَاءَةِ ٱلْكُتُبِ qirāʾati -lkutubi which would indicate that the reading was general or complete.\nWhen the doer comes between the maṣdar and the doee. Example,\nأَلِمَ عَمْرٌو مِنْ ضَرْبِ زَيْدٍ لَهُ.\nʾalima ɛamrun min ḍarbi zaydin lahu.\n“Ɛamr was in pain from Zayd’s beating him.”\nThis is as an optional alternative to putting the doee in the propped-state, in the manner we have already learned in the previous section:\nأَلِمَ عَمْرٌو مِنْ ضَرْبِ زَيْدٍ إِيَّاهُ.\nʾalima ɛamrun min ḍarbi zaydin ʾiyyāhu.\n“Ɛamr was in pain from Zayd’s beating him.”",

    "section": "18.4 Multiple maṣdars for the same verb",
    "text": "18.4 Multiple maṣdars for the same verb\nIt is possible, and fairly common, for verbs to have more than one maṣdar. Usually, each of the maṣdars has its own meaning, distinct from each other.\nFor example, the verb حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلًا means “to carry (هـ s.th.)” Here is an example of its maṣdar in a sentence:\nتَعِبَ زَيْدٌ مِنْ حَمْلِهِ لِلْكُتُبِ ٱلثَّقِيلَةِ.\ntaɛiba zaydun min ḥamlihi lilkutubi -t͡ht͡haqīlati.\n“Zayd became tired from his carrying the heavy books.”\nThere exists another meaning for this verb with its own maṣdar: حَمَلَ يَحْمِلُ حَمْلَةً which means “to launch an attack (عَلَىٰ on s.o.)” Here is an example of its maṣdar in a sentence:\nدَهِشَ ٱلْقَوْمُ مِنْ حَمْلَةِ ٱلْعَدُوِّ عَلَيْهِمْ.\ndahis͡ha -lqawmu min ḥamlati -lɛaduwwi ɛalayhim.\n“The people were astonished at the attack launched by the enemy on them.”\nSometimes the meaning between the multiple maṣdars is only slight. Consider, for example, the verb جَهِلَ يَجْهَلُ “to not know, or to be ignorant (هـ of s.th.)”\nIt has two maṣdars: جَهْلٌ jahl and جَهَالَة jahālah which have meanings that are close to each other.\nجَهْلٌ jahl is the more simple maṣdar used for not knowing something. For example,\nمَا فَعَلَ زَيْدٌ ٱلْوَاجِبَ لِجَهْلِهِ إِيَّاهُ.\nmā faɛala zayduni -lwājiba lijahlihi ʾiyyāhu.\n“Zayd did not do the obligatory [work] because of his not knowing it.”\nجَهَالَة jahālah has the more abstract meaning of “ignorance”. For example,\nنَفَرَ ٱلْمُسْلِمُ مِنْ جَهَالَةِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ.\nnafara -lmuslimu min jahālati -lmus͡hrikīna.\n“The Muslim was repulsed by the ignorance of the pagans.”\nAs a general rule of thumb, the fewer letters in a maṣdar, the simpler its meaning. And maṣdars of the pattern فَعَالَة faɛālah tend to have an abstract meaning.",

Their common noun meaning is typically associated, in some manner, with their verbal meaning.\n\nFor example, the verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا means “to question or ask (ه عن s.o. about s.th.)”. The maṣdar سُؤَالٌ suʾālun can be used with its verbal meaning: “questioning”.

    "section": "20.3 After أَنْ ʾan",
    "text": "20.3 After أَنْ ʾan\nأَنْ ʾan “that” is the main article which causes the following resembling verb to be in the propped-state. The other articles that we listed in the introduction are all either derived from أَنْ or include its meaning implicitly without expressing it.\n\n20.3.1 Basic usage of أَنْ ʾan with the propped-state resembling verb\nأَنْ often follows verbs that have a meaning of wishing or hoping. For example,\nأَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ أَنْ يَنْجَحَ.\nʾamala -ṭṭālibu ʾan yanjaḥ.\n“The student hoped that he succeed.”\nلَا can be used to negate the following propped-state resembling verb. لَا combines with أَنْ and assimilates with it to form أَلَّا ʾallā “that not”. For example,\nأَمَرَ ٱلْأَبُ ٱلِٱبْنَ أَلَّا يَكْسَلَ.\nʾamara -lʾabu li-bna ʾallā yaksal.\n“The father ordered the son that he not be lazy.”\nOther than this لَا, أَنْ must directly precede the following propped-state resembling verb and must not be separated from it.\n\n\n20.3.2 Grammatical equivalence of أَنْ clause with a maṣdar\nIn grammatical theory, أَنْ and the following verb form a clause that is equivalent in meaning to the maṣdar of the verb. So in the example, أَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ أَنْ يَنْجَحَ., the أَنْ clause is أَنْ يَنْجَحَ. It is equivalent to the maṣdar ٱلنَّجَاح. So the sentence is grammatically equivalent to\nأَمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلنَّجَاحَ.\nʾamala -ṭṭālibu -nnajāḥ.\n“The student hoped [for] success.”\nThis grammatical equivalence of the أَنْ clause with a noun aloows the أَنْ clause to take the place of a noun in various positions in a sentence. So, in the above example, the أَنْ clause is in place of the direct doee of the verb أَمَلَ:\n\nWe show other examples below where the أَنْ clause occurs in place of other noun positions.\nAs the subject:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: نَجَاحَكَ هُوَ ٱلْمَقْصِدُ..\nAs the comment:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: ٱَلْمَقْصِدُ نَجَاحَكَ..\nAs a doer noun:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: يَحْزُنُنِي ذَهَابُهُ..\nIn the lowered-state as the base noun in an annexation:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: سَكَتَتْ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ غَضَبِهِ عَلَيْهَا..\nIn the lowered-state after a preposition:\n\nwhich is grammatically equivalent to: رَغِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ فِي أَكْلِ ٱلطَّعَامِ..\n\n\n20.3.3 Option to drop the preposition before أَنْ\nIn the above example the verb رَغِبَ يَرْغَبُ takes an indirect doee after the preposition فِي. In such cases, where the أَنْ clause occurs after a preposition, it is common to drop the preposition as long as there is not resulting confusion in meaning. So, we can also say (without the preposition فِي) for the same meaning:\nرَغِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ ٱلطَّعَامَ.\n“The boy desired that he eat the food.”\n\n\n20.3.4 أَنْ meaning “lest”\nOcassionally, أَنْ is used with the meaning “lest”. For example:\nقَتَلْتُ ٱلثُّعْبَانَ أَنْ يَقْتُلَنِي.\n“I killed the serpent lest it kill me.”\n\n\n20.3.5 أَنْ with the past verb\nأَنْ may also occur before a past verb. Example:\nبَلَغَنِي أَنْ رَجَعْتَ.\n“That you have returned has reached me.”\n\n\n20.3.6 Other types of أَنْ\nThere are other types of أَنْ in the Arabic language. They all have the basic meaning “that”. But they are used in different grammatical ways.\nThe أَنْ we have learned here is called the maṣdari أَنْ because of the equivalence of its clause with a maṣdar.\nThere is also another type of أَنْ called the lightened أَنْ that we will learn in section @ref(lightened-an).\nThere is also the explanatory أَنْ and the extra أَنْ that we will cover in chapter @ref(types-of-an).",

    "text": "20.4 After لِ li\n\n20.4.1 The لِ of purpose\nThe article أَنْ may be attached to the preposition لِ li thus: لِأَنْ liʾan to give the purpose of the following verb. This لِ may be translated as “so that”. For example:\nأَكَلَ لِأَنْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate so that he be sated.”\nWhen لِ is thus used, أَنْ is optionally allowed to be dropped while its meaning is retained. لِ is then attached to the verb. So we can say, for the same meaning:\nأَكَلَ لِيَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate so that he be sated.”\nBut when using لَا to negate the verb, then أَنْ must be expressed, and the combination of لِ, أَنْ, and لَا is written as لِئَلَّا liʾallā. For example,\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ لِئَلَّا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water so that he not be thirsty.”\n\nBy the way, the grammatical equivalence of أَنْ and a following propped-state resembling verb with a maṣdar applies also to when لِ is used before (either an expressed or an implied) أَنْ. So, for example, if we have a sentence:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِيَعْلَمَ مَفْهُومَهُ.\nor\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِأَنْ يَعْلَمَ مَفْهُومَهُ.\n“He read the book so that he know its meaning.”\nThen, grammatically, أَنْ and what follows it may be expressed with the maṣdar عِلْم thus:\nقَرَأَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِعِلْمِ مَفْهُومِهِ.\n“He read the book for the knowledge of its meaning.”\n\n\n20.4.2 The لِ of denial\nThere is a specific لِ, called the لِ of denial, which is used with propped-state resembling verbs and the verb كَانَ that we will discuss in section (TODO in كَانَ chapter).",

    "text": "20.5 After كَيْ kay\nكَيْ kay is a preposition similar to لِ in meaning. It may be translated as “in order that”, or also as “so that”. It is also used before the propped-state resembling verb. The difference from لِ is that, when لِ is used with the propped-state resembling verb, expressing or dropping the أَنْ was optional. But with كَيْ, dropping the أَنْ is mandatory, while its meaning is retained. For example:\nأَكَلَ كَيْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate in order that he be sated.”\nلَا is used, as usual, to negate the verb and is attached to كَيْ thus: كَيْلَا kaylā. Example:\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ كَيْلَا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water in order that he not be thirsty.”\nThe preposition لِ may be combined with كَيْ thus: لِكَيْ likay, for more or less the same meaning. For example:\nأَكَلَ لِكَيْ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He ate in order that he be sated.”\nWith لَا the whole combination is written as لِكَيْلَا likaylā. أَنْ must again be not be expressed.\nExample:\nشَرِبَ ٱلْمَاءَ لِكَيْلَا يَعْطَشَ.\n“He drank the water in order that he not be thirsty.”\nBy the way, كَيْ and a following propped-state resembling verb are not directly replaced by a maṣdar.

    "section": "20.6 After حَتَّىٰ ḥattā",
    "text": "20.6 After حَتَّىٰ ḥattā\nحَتَّىٰ ḥattā is a particle that can be used in multiple ways. Its basic meaning is “until” or “to the point of” or “even” where it indicates an extreme limit.\nBefore we discuss its use with a verb following it, we will take a short digression to discuss its use with a following noun.\n\n20.6.1 حَتَّىٰ ḥattā with a following noun\nConsider the following sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ حَتَّىٰ رَأْسِهَا.\n“I ate the fish until its head.”\nحَتَّىٰ “until”, here, is used as a preposition. Therefore, رَأْس is in the lowered-state, as the noun following a preposition. The meaning of the sentence is that the fish was eaten all the way to its head. (Whether the head itself was eaten or not is ambiguous. The sentence itself admits both meanings.)\nConsider now a variant of this sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ حَتَّىٰ رَأْسَهَا.\n“I ate the fish, even its head.”\nرَأْس, here, is in the propped-state because it is a direct doee of the verb أَكَلَ “ate”. The particle حَتَّىٰ “even”, here, is only a connector between the direct doees in much the same way as وَ “and”. (أَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ وَرَأْسَهَا. “I ate the fish and its head.”)\nConsider now yet another variant of this sentence:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلسَّمَكَةَ. حَتَّىٰ رَأْسُهَا [أَكَلْتُهَا].\n“I ate the fish. Even its head [I ate].”\nNow رَأْس is in the raised-state because it is actually the subject of a new sentence, whose comment is (an either expressed or implied) أَكَلْتُهَا “I ate it”. حَتَّىٰ, here, serves as an introductory particle to the second subject and does not affect the state of the following noun.\n\n\n20.6.2 حَتَّىٰ ḥattā with a following verb\n\nJust as حَتَّىٰ is used for different purposes with a following noun, so too is it used with different purposes with a verb following it.\n\n20.6.2.1 حَتَّىٰ with a following propped-state resembling verb\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used with an expectation or purpose of a future action of the verb following it, then the verb following it is an propped-state resembling verb.  This is done in the following two scenarios:\n\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used to indicate an extreme point at which the action of the following verb would occur, or is meant to occur. Here, حَتَّىٰ may be translated as “to the point of” and the verb following it is translated using “-ing”. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ حَتَّىٰ أَخْتِمَهُ.\n“I read the Qurʾān to the point of finishing it.”\nيَغْضَبُ حَتَّىٰ يَهْرَبُوا مِنْهُ.\n“He becomes angry to the point of their fleeing from him.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ لَا يَمْلِكَ نَفْسَهُ.\n“He became angry to the point of not controlling himself.”\nIt is noteworthy that the use of حَتَّىٰ, here, implies only that the following action is meant to occur, or is at the point of being expected to occur. It doesn’t actually state that the action will actually occur, for something may prevent it from occurring in reality.1\nNote, also, that لَا is not attached to حَتَّىٰ in حَتَّىٰ لَا.\nAlso, similar to the case of كَيْ, there is an assumed (but mandatorily unexpressed) أَنْ which is the real cause of the following resembling verb being in the propped-state. In fact, حَتَّىٰ, here, can be considered synonymous to إِلَىٰ أَنْ “to [the point] that”. So the above examples can be considered similar in meaning to:\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ إِلَىٰ أَنْ أَخْتِمَهُ.\nيَغْضَبُ إِلَىٰ أَنْ يَهْرَبُوا مِنْهُ.\nغَضِبَ إِلَىٰ أَلَّا يَمْلِكَ نَفْسَهُ.\nWhen حَتَّىٰ is used with the meaning “to such a purpose that”. This is a similar meaning to كَيْ “in order that”. For example,\nأَذْهَبُ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَأْمُرَنِي بِشَيْءٍ.\n“I go to him to such a purpose that he order me [to do] something.”\nوَعَظَ ٱلْأَبُ ٱبْنَهُ حَتَّىٰ يَصْلُحَ.\n“The father admonished his son to such a purpose that he be righteous.”\nAgain, there is an assumed (but mandatorily unexpressed) أَنْ which is the real cause of the following resembling verb being in the propped-state.\n\nSometimes, the sentence itself may admit both of the above meanings. For example:\nيَأْكُلُ حَتَّىٰ يَشْبَعَ.\n“He eats to the point of being full.”\nand/or\n“He eats to the purpose that he be full.”\nContext would be needed to determine which meaning or whether both meanings are intended.\n\n\n20.6.2.2 حَتَّىٰ with no effect on the following verb\nIf حَتَّىٰ is not used with any expectation or purpose of a future action of the verb following it, then it has no effect on this verb. (It goes without saying that an implicit أَنْ is not assumed with حَتَّىٰ in this case.)\nThe verb following حَتَّىٰ in this case may even be a past verb. For example:\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ حَتَّىٰ شَبِعْتُ.\n“I ate the food until I became full.”\nWhen used with a following resembling verb, the verb is put in the raised-state and the meaning is that the action of the verb before حَتَّىٰ was done to such an extent that it caused the action of the verb following حَتَّىٰ to definitely occur. The action before حَتَّىٰ must necessarily be a past action, and the action following حَتَّىٰ must necessarily be a present (not a future) action. For example,\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ حَتَّىٰ أَشْبَعُ.\n“I ate the food to such an extent that I am (being) full.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ يَهْرَبُونَ مِنْهُ.\n“He became so angry that they are fleeing from him.”\nغَضِبَ حَتَّىٰ لَا يَمْلِكُ نَفْسَهُ.\n“He became so angry that he is not controlling himself.”\nCompare these examples with the corresponding ones in the previous sub-section that have an propped-state resembling verb.",

    "text": "21.8 The verb of command\nIn order to give a direct command to an addressee, Arabic uses the verb of command. The verb of command is very similar to the clipped-state resembling verb. The verb of command is only available for the addressee participant.\n\n21.8.1 Forming the verb of command\nHere is the verb of command for the addressee participants:\n\n\n\nParticipant\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nyou1,m\nٱفْعَلْ\n\n\nyou1,f\nٱفْعَلِي\n\n\nyou2\nٱفْعَلَا\n\n\nyou3+,m\nٱفْعَلُوا\n\n\nyou3+,f\nٱفْعَلْنَ\n\n\n\nIn order to form the verb of command, we remove the initial ت from the addressee particpant verb. The verb then begins with an sukūn so we place a connecting hamzah in front of it.\nWhen the verb of command occurs in the beginning of a sentence, then the vowel mark for the connecting hamzah is selected according to the following criteria:\n\nWhen the middle root letter of the verb of command has an ḍammah ◌ُ, then the connecting hamzah gets an ḍammah too. Examples:\n\n\n\nVerb\nVerb of command for “he”\n\n\n\n\nنَظَرَ يَنْظُرُ نَظَرًا\nٱُنْظُرْ “Look!”\n\n\nقَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا\nٱُقْتُلْ “Kill!”\n\n\nمَكَثَ يَمْكُثُ مُكُوثًا\nٱُمْكُثْ “Stay!”\n\n\n\nOtherwise, when the middle root letter of the verb of command has an fat·ḥah ◌َ or an kasrah ◌ِ, then the connecting hamzah gets an kasrah ◌ِ. Examples:\n\n\n\nVerb\nVerb of command for “he”\n\n\n\n\nعَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا\nٱِعْمَلْ “Work!”\n\n\nذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا\nٱِذْهَبْ “Go!”\n\n\nجَلَسَ يَجْلِسُ جُلُوسًا\nٱِجْلِسْ “Sit!”\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of using the verb of command:\nThe verb of command is not used to issue negative commands, like “Don’t go!”. Instead, the clipped-state verb is used with لَا as described in section @ref(la-of-prohibition) above.\nلَا تَذْهَبْ\n“Don’t go!”\n\n\n21.8.2 The verb of command for roots begin with hamzah\nAppendix @ref(hamzarules) details the rules for speeling words that contain hamzah generally. In addition to those rules, the verb of command for roots that begin with hamzah warrant additional discussion.\nConsider the following form 1 verbs and their verbs of command for the singular masculine addressee doer “he”:\n\n\n\nRoot\nVerb\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nأمل\nأَمَلَ يَأْمُلُ أَمَلًا “to hope”\nٱؤْمُلْ\n\n\nأذن\nأَذِنَ يَأذَنُ أَذَنًا “to permit”\nٱئْذَنْ\n\n\n\nHere are examples of these verbs of commands in the middle of a sentence:\nيَا أُمِّي ٱئْذَنِي لِي ٱللَّعِبَ!\nyā ʾummi -ʾd͡hanī li -llaɛib!\n“O my mother, permit me to play!”\nيَا زَيْدُ ٱؤْمُلِ ٱلْخَيْرَ!\nyā zaydu -ʾmuli -lk͡hayr!\n“O Zayd, hope for good!”\nWhen these verbs of command occur in the beginning of the sentence, then there would be two hamzahs occuring next to each other which is not permitted. So the second hamzah is pronounced as a long vowel, though it may still be written as a hamzah. Examples:\nٱُؤمُلِ ٱلْخَيْرَ يَا زَيْدُ!\nʾūmul\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ʾuʾmul\nٱِئذَنِي لِي ٱللَّعِبَ يَا أُمِّي!\nʾīd͡hanī\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) ʾiʾd͡hanī\nAs a further complication, when the verb of command is preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so” then the connecting hamza is not written and the hamzah of the first root letter is written seated on an alif. Examples:\nوَأْمُلْ\nwaʾmul\n“And hope!”\nفَأْذَنْ\nfaʾd͡han\n“So permit!”\n\n\n21.8.3 Irregular verbs of command\nIn addition to the rules states above there are four verbs of command (all containing hamzah) that are irregular. We will discuss them below:\n\n21.8.3.1 The verbs أَكَلَ , أَخَذَ , and أَمَرَ\nThe verbs of command for the following three verbs are irregular:\n\n\n\nRoot\nVerb\nVerb of command\n\n\n\n\nأكل\nأَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا “to eat”\nكُلْ\n\n\nأخذ\nأَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا “to take”\nخُذْ\n\n\nأمر\nأَمَرَ يَأْمُرُ أَمْرًا “to order”\nمُرْ\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the initial hamzah has been completely deleted for the verbs of command. However, of these verbs, the verb of command for أَمَرَ يَأْمُرُ أَمْرًا is permitted to retain its initial hamzah when preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so”. Then, it becomes\nوَأْمُرْ waʾmur\nand\nفَأْمُرْ faʾmur\nThis retaining of the initial hamzah is not done for the other two verbs.\nHere are some examples of these verbs of command:\n\n\n21.8.3.2 The verb سَأَلَ\nThe verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا “to question” forms its verb of command both regularly, and irregularly:\n\nRegular: ٱسْأَلْ ʾisʾal\nIrregular: سَلْ sal\n\nIf the verb of command is preceded by وَ “and” or فَ “so”, then the regular verb of command ٱسْأَلْ ʾisʾal is often preferred.\nOtherwise, the irregular verb of command سَلْ sal is often preferred.\nExamples of usage:",

There are about 15 or so additional forms of the verb. But only 10 or so are in common usage.\nLearning these additional forms may seem tedious but we advise you to persevere because additional forms of the verb are used very commonly.\nThe form 1 verb has variability in the middle (ع) letter, which can have either an fat·ḥah, kasrah, or ḍammah. It also has variability in the pattern its maṣdar. The additional forms have almost no variability of this kind. So, in one sense, the additional forms of the verb are easier than the form 1 verb.",

    "text": "23.2 Determining when a noun is an adverb of time or place\nThe term adverb in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns. Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs. For example, the noun يَوْم doesn’t necessarily need to be used as an adverb. It may be used, for example, as the subject of a sentence:\n\nٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.\n“The day is long.”\n\nEven when it is in the propped-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. Here it is as a direct doee:\n\nأَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.\n“I wait for an easy day.”\n\nThe way that we can tell when a noun is an adevrb of time or place is if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\nThe noun is in the propped-state.\nThe noun is extra, such that the sentence is complete, albeit more vague, without it.\nThe noun signifies the time or place in which the verb occurred.\n\nIn the sentence أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا, the noun يَوْم is not signify the time in which the verb أَنْتَظِرُ is ocurring. So it is not an adverb of time.\nHaving said that, there are nouns that are used exclusively or mostly as adverbs, like قَبْل “before”.

For example:\nAs a definite common noun:\n\nذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ ٱلْيَوْمَ.\n“Zayd went to the market today.”\n(ٱلْيَوْم “the day” is also used to mean “today”.)\n\nWith a describer:\n\nقَتَلْتُهُ ٱلسَّنَةَ ٱلْمَاضِيَةَ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I killed him last year.”\n\nAs a proper noun:\n\nصُمْتُ رَمَضَانَ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I fasted (the month of) Ramaḍān.”\n\nAs an annexe noun to a base noun:\n\nجِئْتُ زَمَنَ ٱلشِّتَاءِ. [Wright 2/110A]\n“I came in the winter-time.”\n\nAs an annexe noun to a sentence:\n\nصَحَبْتُ صَدِيقِي يَوْمَ خَرَجْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ.\n“I accompanied my friend the day we left the city.”\n\nAs a dual or plural:\n\nتَأَمَّلْ شَهْرَيْنِ فِي ٱخْتِيَارِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذِ. [Wright 2/109D]\n“Reflect two months upon the choice of a teacher.”\nسَكَنَ فِي بَعْضِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَيَّامًا. [Wright 2/109D]\n“He stayed in one of the villages (a few) days.”\n\nThe adverb before its verb in sentence word order1:\n\nٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ [سورة المائدة 5:3]\n“This day I have perfected for you your religion”",

    "section": "23.4 The adverb of place",
    "text": "23.4 The adverb of place\nThe adverb of place is more restricted than the adverb of time. Only some nouns are suitable to function as adverbs of place. Such nouns fall under some categories that we will discuss in the next few subsections:\n\n23.4.1 Vague and unbounded nouns\nGenerally, only vague and unbounded nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place. A noun that denotes a specific place are not permitted. So, for example, we can’t use the noun بَيْت as an adverb of place to say جَلَسْتُ بَيْتًا. Instead we’ll have to use the preposition فِي and say جَلَسْتُ فِي بَيْتٍ.\nDirectional nouns are considered vague enough to be used as adverbs of place. Such nouns include:\n\nأَمَام, قُدَّام “in front (of)”\nخَلْفَ, وَرَاء “behind”\nفَوْق “above”\nتَحْت “under”, أَسْفَل “lower”, دُون “beneath”\nيَمِين “right”\nشِمَال, يَسَار “left”\n\nPermitted also are general spatial nouns like:\n\nوَسْط “in the middle (of)”\nحَوْل “around”\nعِنْد, لَدُنْ, لَدَىٰ “at, with, by”\nمَع “with”\nبَيْن “between”\n\nSome of the nouns above we have introduced previously in section (ref) as pseudo-prepositions. But they are actually nouns, that when used as adverbs give meanings similar to prepositions.\n\nHere is an example of the use of these nouns as adverbs of place:\n\nنَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَيَسَارًا (وَشِمَالًا) [Wright 2/111B]\n“He looked right and left.”\n\n\nMost of these nouns can be, and often are, annexe nouns. When they are annexed to a definite noun then they too will be definite. But this in no way restricts their vagueness and thus ability to be used as adverbs of place.2 For example,\n\nبَايَعْنَا النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ [صحيح البخاري :7208]\n“We gave the oath of allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ under the tree”\n\n\nThere are some nouns whose meaning is associated with the word “side”:\n\nجَانِب, نَاحِيَة, وَجْه, جِهَة “side”\nدَاخِل, جَوْف “inside”\nخَارِج “outside”\n\nWith these nouns, it is more common to use prepositions like فِي, إلَىٰ, or مِنْ before them. For example,\n\nنِمْتُ فِي خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ [Wright 2/112A]\n“I slept outside the house.”\nزَيْدٌ فِي جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو.\nor\nزَيْدٌ إِلَىٰ جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو. [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/489]\n“Zayd is beside Ɛamr”\nزَيْدٌ مِنْ خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ. [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/489]\n“Zayd is outside the house.”\n\nBut they may be used, less commonly, as adverbs of place as well. For example,\n\nأَتَشَوَّفُ دَاخِلًا وَخَارِجًا [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :6520]\n“I (was) looking inside and outside.”\nفَهُوَ مُتَّكِئٌ عَلَيْهَا دَاخِلَ الْمَسْجِدِ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :15837]\n“And he (was) relying on [our arms] inside the mosque”\n\n\nSome place nouns are vague in that they mean “place”, like مَكَان, مَوْضِع, and مَقَام. These nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place when indefinite. For example:\n\nفَتُصَلِّيَ فِي بَيْتِي مَكَانًا [سنن ابن ماجه :754]\n“that you may pray in my house (at) a place”\n\nWhen definite then they may only be used as nouns of place when construed with a verb conveying the idea of stopping or remaining. For example,\n\nجَلَسْتُ مَكَانَ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/111D]\n“I sat down in Zayd’s place.”\nامْكُثْ مَكَانَكَ [سنن أبي داود :940]\n“Stay (at) your place.”\n\nThe noun مَكَان is also used in an annexation to mean “in place of”. With this meaning, it may be used as an adverb of place unrestrictedly. For example,\n\nخُذْ هَـٰذَا مَكَانَ ذَ ٰلِكَ [النحو الوافي 2/261]\n“Take this in place of that.”\n\nSo too may the noun بَدَل “replacement” be used in this way.\n\nخُذْ هَـٰذَا بَدَلَ ذَ ٰلِكَ [النحو الوافي 2/261]\n“Take this in replacement of that.”\n\nExcluded from this restriction of vagueness are nouns used with the verbs دَخَلَ “to enter”, سَكَنَ “to dwell”, and نَزَلَ “to alight”.3 So we can say دَخَلْتُ ٱلدَّارَ “I entered the house,” سَكَنْتُ ٱلْبَيْتَ “I dwelled (in) the house,” and نَزَلْتُ ٱلْبَلَدَ “I alighted (in) the country.” The propped-state nouns with these verbs may be considered either direct doees or adverbs of place. Excluded also, is the country name ٱلشَّأْم “Syria” with the verb ذَهَبَ “to go.” So we can say ذَهَبْتُ ٱلشَّأْمَ for “I went (to) Syria.”\n\n\n23.4.2 Units of distance and space\nUnits of distance and space are permitted to be used as adverbs of place. For example:\n\n\nسَارُوا مِيلًا\n“They travelled a mile.”\nمَشَيْتُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ [Wright 2/111B]\n“I walked two parasangs.”\n(A فَرْسَخْ is a unit of distance approximately equal to three miles.)\nجَرَىٰ غَلْوَةً [Wright 2/111B]\n“He ran the distance of a bowshot.”\n\n\n\n23.4.3 Nouns of place\nIn section (ref) we studied the noun of place, which is formed on the pattern مَفْعِل or مَفْعَل. The noun of place is permitted to be used as an adverb of place, but only when construed with the verb from which it is derived. For example,\n\nقَعَدْتُ مَقْعَدَ زَيْدٍ,\nجَلَسْتُ مَجْلِسَ زَيْدٍ [Wright 2/112A]\nI sat down in Zayd’s seat.\nرَأَى النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبًا مُوَاجِهًا لِلْقِبْلَةِ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :5741]\n“He saw the Prophet ﷺ going a path facing towards the qiblah.”\n\nAlso included in this category are the vague place nouns (like مَكَان, مَوْضِع, and مَقَام) annexed to the verb’s maṣdar. They may occur as adverbs of place instead of the verb’s actual noun of place. For example,\n\nقاتلت موضع القتال [شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/490]\n“I fought (in) the place of fighting.”",

This other noun then becomes the adverb in the propped-state as the deputy of the original adverb. The meaning of the original (substituted) adverb is then implied. The substitute may be from the following categories:\n\n23.5.1 A qualifier\nWhen an adverb of time or place is qualified by another noun, then the adverb may be dropped and the qualifier may take its place.4\nSuch qualifiers include:\n\nA describer:\n\nجلست شرقي الدار [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I sat east of the house.”\n(for جلست مَكَانًا شرقي الدار)\nجَلَسْتُ عِنْدَهُ طَوِيلًا مِنَ ٱلدَّهْرِ [Wright 2/110B]\n“I sat with him (for) a long (time).” (for زَمَنًا طَوِيلًا)\n\nA number:\n\nسَارُوا أَرْبَعَةَ أَمْيالٍ [Wright 2/111B]\n“They travelled four miles.”\n(Technically the number أَرْبَعَة is the adverb in the propped-state.)\n\nA fraction or a whole:\n\nلَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [سورة المؤمنون 23:113]\n“We remained a day or part of a day”\n\nA pointing noun:\n\nجئت هذا الوقت [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I came (at) this time.”\nخرج محمد هذه الساعة [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“Muḥammad left (at) this hour.”\nسرت هذه المسافة [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I travelled this distance.”\n\n\n\n\n23.5.2 A maṣdar\nA maṣdar may substitute an adverb of time or place if:\n\nthe meaning “at the time of” or “the amount of time of” is implied for adverb of time;\nand the meaning “at the place of” “the amount of space of” is implied for the adverb of place.\n\nExamples:\n\nجَاءَ طُلُوعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ [Wright 2/110C]\n“He came (at the time of) the rising of the sun.”\n(for جَاءَ وَقْتَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ)\nجِئْتُ صَلَاةَ ٱلْعَصْرِ [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I came (at the time of) the ɛaṣr prayer.”\n(for جِئْتُ وَقْتَ صَلَاةِ ٱلْعَصْرِ.)\nٱنْتَظَرْتُهُ حَلْبَ نَاقَةٍ [معاني النحو 2/191]\n“I waited for him (the amount of time of) the milking of a she-camel.”\n(for ٱنْتَظَرْتُهُ مِقْدَارَ حَلْبِ نَاقَةٍ\nجَلَسْتُ قُرْبَ زَيْدٍ [شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 2/200]\n“I sat near Zayd.”\n(literally: “I sat (at the place of) the nearness of Zayd.”)\n\nThis substitution by a maṣdar is more common for the adverb of time than for the adverb of place.5",

    "section": "23.6 Using prepositions instead of adverbs of time and place",
    "text": "23.6 Using prepositions instead of adverbs of time and place\nOften we can replace a noun used as an adverb of time or place by a preposition followed by the same noun. This preposition is usually فِي. For example, instead of saying: خَرَجْتُ يَوْمًا مَاطِرًا “I left (on) a rainy day,” we can say:\n\nخَرَجْتُ فِي يَوْمٍ مَاطِرٍ\n“I left (on) a rainy day.”\n(literally “in a rainy day”.)\n\nThe noun يَوْم is technically no longer an adverb since it is not in the propped-state. The preposition فِي signifies that the verb occurs in the time or place denoted by the adverb. So, in the example above, my act of leaving ocurred in a time which is denoted by “a rainy day”. In cases like the example above, the choice of whether to use an adverb or preposition is a matter of style, and is up to the speaker.\nNote, however, that this substitution with فِي is not always literally correct.6 For example, we can’t say \\(\\times\\) طار الطائر في فوق الشجرة for “The bird flew above the tree.” Instead we have to say طار الطائر فوق الشجرة. Nevertheless, the idea of فِي is still correct in that the bird flew in the space which is above the tree.\nAnd sometimes, if we substitute a noun used as an adverb with فِي followed by the noun, then the sentence may be grammatically correct, but with a different meaning from the original. Consider the following examples:\n\nفَعَلْتُ هَـٰذَا سَبْعَةَ أَيَّامٍ [معاني النحو 2/179]\n“I did this (for) seven days.”\nفَعَلْتُ هَـٰذَا فِي سَبْعَةِ أَيَّامٍ [معاني النحو 2/179]\n“I did this (in) seven days.”\n\nExample (43) indicates that I did an action repeatedly during seven days. Whereas example (44) indicates that I did the action once, and it took seven days to complete the action.\nSimilarly, consider these two examples:\n\nأَدْرُسُ ٱللَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ [معاني النحو 2/181]\n“I study night and day.”\nأَدْرُسُ فِي ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ [معاني النحو 2/181]\n“I study in the night and day.”\n\nExample (45) is about the amount of time that I study. This is the answer to “How much do you study?” Whereas example (46) is about the period of time during which I study. This is the answer to “When do you study?”\n\n23.6.1 Using other prepositions besides فِي\nWhile فِي is the most general preposition for substituting an adverb, other prepositions are also used. This often depends on the adverb itself. For example, instead of saying أَخْرُجُ غَدًا for “I will leave tomorrow,” we can say:\n\nأَخْرُجُ بِالْغَدِ\n“I will leave tomorrow”\n\nAnd instead of saying نَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا for “He looked right and left,” we can say:\n\nنَظَرَ عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ ٱلشِّمَالِ\n“He looked right and left.”\n\nOne common preposition used before a class of adverbs is مِنْ. We will discuss it separately in the next section below.",

    "section": "23.7 Using مِنْ before some adverbs",
    "text": "23.7 Using مِنْ before some adverbs\nThere are some nouns that are used as adverbs, but are also used with the preposition مِنْ to give the same adverbial meaning. Some of these nouns are عِنْد, لَدُن “by, with”, قَبْل “before”, بَعْد “after”, فَوْق “above”, تَحْت “under”,7 etc.\nOften times, مِنْ signifies its literal meaning “from”, as usual. For example:\n\nمَكَثْتُ عِنْدَكَ سَاعَةً ثُمَّ خَرَجُتُ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِي [النحو الوافي 2/262]\n“I stayed at your [place] an hour, then I left from your place to my house.”\n\nOther times, the significance of this مِنْ is less obvious. Consider the following examples:\n\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرآنَ بَعْدَ صَلَاةَ ٱلْعَصْرِ\n“I read the Qurʾān after the ɛaṣr prayer.”\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْقُرآنَ مِنْ بَعْدِ صَلَاةِ ٱلْعَصْرِ\n“I read the Qurʾān (during a time which starts) from after the ɛaṣr prayer.”\n\nExample (51) specifies the beginning of the time period that is indicated by the adverb. Technically, this is not necessarily when the action of the verb began. But this usage of مِنْ could be used to signify that the action started very close to the beginning of the time period. That is, it could indicate that I started to read the Qurʾān right after the ɛaṣr prayer.8\nOften, when the meaning of مِنْ is subtle, it is not translated as “from”. For example:\n\nلِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ مِنْ بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا [سورة الحج 22:5]\n“so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing”\nلِكَيْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النحل 16:70]\n“so that he will not know, after [having had] knowledge, a thing”\n\nSometimes it may be left untranslated.",

    "text": "23.8 قَبْل and its sisters\nThere are a class of nouns, which are usually adverbs of time and place, that are sometimes flexible, and sometimes rigid. These nouns are:\n\nقَبْل “before”\nبَعْد “after”\nدُون “beneath”,\nأَسْفَل “lower”\nفَوْق “above”\nتَحْت “under”\nأَمَام, قُدَّام “in front”\nخَلْف, وَرَاء “behind”\nعَلُ, عَلْو, “on top”\nأَوَّل “first”\n\nAlso usually included with these are9:\n\nيَمِين “right”\nشِمَال “left”\nآخِر “last”\n\nCollectively, we will call them قَبْل and its sisters.\nWe have already seen some of these being used used as adverbs of time or place. The cases for determining when they are flexible and when rigid are as follows:\n\nWhen used as annexe nouns with a mentioned base noun: When used as annexe nouns then قَبْل and its sisters are flexible. For example,\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ ٱلْجَيْشِ\n“The commander stood in front of the army”\n\nAs we’ve previously discussed, instead of using these nouns as adverbs, it is common to also precede them with a preposition, like مِنْ. For example:\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ ٱلْجَيْشِ\n“The commander stood in front of the army”\n\nIn this case, whether قَبْل or one of its sisters is an adverb in the propped-state, or following a preposition in the lowered-state, then it is flexible. This is indicated in the examples above by the fat·ḥah on its ending when in the propped-state, and the kasrah when in the lowered-state.\nWhen used as annexe nouns but the base noun is not mentioned: Rarely, for stylistic reasons, the base noun in sentences like the example above is dropped. But the presence of the base noun is intended by the speaker. In such cases, the annexe noun will be flexible and without tanwīn. For example:\n\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ\n“The commander stood in front [of the army]”\n\n\nMore commonly, the base noun is deleted, both in expression and in intention, but the adverb is still understood to be bounded implicitly. In this case, قَبْل and its sisters will be rigid. Their ending will have a ḍammah regardless of whether they are in the propped-state (as an adverb) or in the lowered-state (following مِنْ). For example:\n\n\nقَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامُ\n\nقَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامُ\n“The army arrived, and the commander stood in front (of the army)”\n\n\nThis usage is quite common. Much more so than case b. where the base noun is dropped only stylistically.\nLastly, قَبْل and its sisters may occur as indefinite nouns without an implicit or explicit base noun. They then have an absolute and unbounded meaning. In this case, they are flexible.  For example,\n\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامًا\n\nقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامٍ\n“The commander stood in front”\n\n\nIn the example above, we can see that أَمًام is a flexible noun due to its tanwīn. \n\nThe difference in meaning between some of these cases is quite subtle. In practice, cases a. and c. are more common. And case b. is rare.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nيُخْرِجُ غِلْمَانَهُ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَلَا يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ ذِي الْحُلَيْفَةِ، يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ أَمَامِ ذَلِكَ [مصنف ابن أبي شيبة :14178]\n“He would take his (slave) boys out for the Ḥajj. But they would not enter iḥrām from D͡hu l-Ḥulayfah; they would enter iḥrām from before that [location].”\n\nThe words أَوَّل and أَسْفَل also have some rules that are specific to them and we will treat them separately in section (ref).",

For example:\n\nٱجْلِسْ عِنْدِي سَاعَةً\n“Sit with me an hour.” (عِنْد is an adverb of place and سَاعَة is a adverb of time.)\n\nWhen both are adverbs of the same kind:\n\nWhen the second adverb is a replacement for the first. For example:\n\nأُقَابِلُكَ يَومَ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ ظُهْرًا [النحو الوافي 2/255]\n“I will meet you Friday afternoon.”\n(ظُهْر is a replacement for يَوْم and specifies when on Friday.)\n\nWhen the adverb is a comparative noun (see chapter (ref)). For example:\n\nٱلْمَرِيضُ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ أَمْسِ [النحو الوافي 2/256]\n“The patient today is better than he (was) yesterday.”\n\n\n\n\n\n23.10.3 Compound adverbs\nInstead of using particles like وَ and فَ between adverbs, compound adverbs may be formed. There are two ways to form a compound adverb:11\n\nBoth adverbs end with a fat·ḥah without tanwīn. For example,\n\nلَقِيتُهُ يَوْمَ يَوْمَ\n“I met him day after day.”\n\nThe adverbs form an annexation. For example,\n\nتَزُورُنَا صَبَاحَ مَسَاءٍ [النحو الوافي 2/271]\n“You visit us morning and night.”\n\n\nBoth options can be used more or less interchangeably. Unless there is a compound adverb with a set meaning. For example:\n\nدَرَجَةُ حَرَارَةِ ٱلْجَوِّ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ\n“The degree of the temperature of the air is intermediate.”",

    "text": "23.11 Some commonly used adverbs of time and place\n\n23.11.1 هُنَا and هُنَاكَ\n\n\n23.11.2 أَسْفَل\nأَسْفَل is actually a comparative noun, meaning “lower”. And even when it is used as an adverb of place, it is with this comparative meaning.12\nMost of the directional nouns, like أَمَام, خَلْفَ, وَرَاء, فَوْق, and تَحْت are used as annexe nouns. For example, فَوْقَ ٱلْأَرْضِ means “above the Earth.”\nWe have learned that comparative nouns are used with the the preposition مِنْ to express their “-er” meaning. For example أَكْبَرُ مِنْ ٱلْبَيْتِ “bigger than the house.” They may also be used as annexe nouns to express their “-est” meaning. For example, أَكْبَرُ بَيْتٍ, أَكْبَرُ ٱلْبُيُوتِ “biggest house.”\nأَسْفَل too may be used in both these formations. We will discuss them below:\n\n23.11.2.1 أَسْفَل used before مِنْ\nUsually أَسْفَل is used with مِنْ to express the adverb of place “lower (than)”  Here are some examples of أَسْفَل, as an adverb of place:\n\nوَٱلرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ 13 [سورة الأنفال 8:42]\n“and the caravan was lower [in position] than you”\nزَيْدٌ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكَ [كتاب سيبويه 3/289]\n“Zayd is lower than you.”\nوَضَعَ رَاحَتَيْهِ عَلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ وَجَعَلَ أَصَابِعَهُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ [سنن النسائي :1036]\n“He put his palms on his knees and put his fingers lower than that.”\nنَهَى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ أَنْ يَقُومَ الْإِمَامُ فَوْقَ شَيْءٍ وَالنَّاسُ خَلْفَهُ يَعْنِي أَسْفَلَ مِنْهُ [مشكاة المصابيح :1692]\n“The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ forbade that the imām should stand on anything when the people are behind him, meaning lower than him.”\n\n\nNote, in the examples above, that أَسْفَل does not have tanwīn. This is because it is a semi-flexible noun.\nNow, in the case of قَبْل and its sisters we saw that their rigidity and flexibility is determined by whether or not they are annexe nouns and if they have base nouns in an annexation.\nBut أَسْفَل, when used with before مِنْ as an adverb of place, is not an annexe noun.  So its rigidity and flexibility is determined by whether or not it is compared to a noun (with مِنْ):\nIf the adverb of place أَسْفَل is followed by مِنْ and a compared noun, then it is flexible. By the way, there may be another مِنْ before أَسْفَل as well, as we learned in section (ref). Here is an example,\n\nإِذْ جَاءُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [سورة الأحزاب 33:10]\n“[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you”\n\nAnd if the adverb of place أَسْفَل is not followed by مِنْ and a compared noun, but the adverb is still understood to be bounded implicitly, then it will be rigid ending with a ḍammah. For example:\n\nوَقَالَ بِأَصَابِعِهِ وَرَفَعَهَا إِلَى فَوْقُ وَطَأْطَأَ إِلَى أَسْفَلُ [صحيح البخاري :621]\n“and he gestured with his fingers and raised them up upward and lowered [them] downward.”\nوالطَّفْرُ وَثْبٌ مِنْ أسْفَلُ الى فَوْقُ [فقه اللغة للثعالبي 137]\n“and aṭṭafr is a leap from down to up.”\n\n\n\n23.11.2.2 أَسْفَل as an annexe noun\nMost of the time, we will want to say that something is below or lower than another thing. In this case, we will use أَسْفَل مِنْ as we have described above.\nHowever, sometimes, we may want to say that something is at the lowest place. In this case, we can use أَسْفَل as an annexe noun to be an adverb of place.14\nFor example,\n\nنَعْلُكَ أَسْفَلُ رِجْلِكَ [النحو الوافي 1/484]\n“Your sandal is (at) the lowest [part] of your foot.”\n(Note the partitive meaning of أَسْفَل annexed to a singular base noun.)\n\n\n\n23.11.2.3 Non-adverbial use of أَسْفَل\nBy the way, أَسْفَل need not always be an adverb of place. It may be used like other common nouns. In the following example, it is the doer of a verb and also an annexe noun.\n\nلَمْ تَبْتَلَّ أَسْفَلُ نِعَالِهِمْ [سنن أبي داود :1059]\n“The lower [part] of their sandals did not get wet.”\n\n\n\n\n23.11.3 أَوَّل\nأَوَّل is used as an adverb of time, meaning “first”\nMuch of what we have said about أَسْفَل applies also to the noun أَوَّل.\nHowever there is some difference from أَسْفَل:\n\nThe meaning of “first” is inherently superlative. In English we dont say that something is more first than another thing. We can try to capture this meaning by translating it as “prior to”.\nأَوَّل, despite being on the pattern أَفْعَل, is irregular in that it can take tanwīn when used in an absolute and unbounded sense.\n\n\n23.11.3.1 أَوَّل used before مِنْ\nأَوَّل is a semi-flexible noun when used with مِنْ:\n\nلاَ تَسْأَلْهُ عَنْ شَىْءٍ أَوَّلَ مِنْ حَدِيثِ الشَّفَاعَةِ [صحيح البخاري :7510]\n“Don’t ask him about anything prior to the ḥadīt͡h of intercession”\nلاَ تَبْتَدِئَانِ بِشَىْءٍ أَوَّلَ مِنَ الْبَيْتِ، تَطُوفَانِ بِهِ [صحيح البخاري :1641]\n“They2f would not begin with anything prior to the House, performing the ṭawāf around it.”\n\nWhen مِنْ is not used but أَوَّل is implicitly bounded then it is rigid with a ḍammah on its ending:\n\nأَىُّ الْقُرْآنِ أُنْزِلَ أَوَّلُ [صحيح البخاري :4924]\n“Which [part] of the Qurʾān was revealed first (of all the sūrahs)?”\nأَىُّ مَسْجِدٍ وُضِعَ أَوَّلُ [سنن ابن ماجه :753]\n“Which mosque was established first (of all the mosques)?”\n\nWhen أَوَّل, is used in an absolute and unbounded sense, then it takes tanwīn despite being on the pattern أَفْعَل:\n\nيَبْتَدِرُونَهَا أَيُّهُمْ يَكْتُبُهَا أَوَّلًا [سنن النسائي :1062]\n“They (were) rushing (to see) which of them would write it first”\nوَأَمَّا الدَّارُ الَّتِي دَخَلْتَ أَوَّلًا فَدَارُ عَامَّةِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ [مسند أحمد ط الرسالة :20165]\n“And as for the house that you entered first, it was for the common people of the Muslims.”\nأَيُّهُمَا جَاءَ أَوَّلًا عَمِلَ عَمَلَهُ [مشكاة المصابيح :1700]\n“Which of them came first [that] did his deed?”\n\n\n\n23.11.3.2 أَوَّل as an annexe noun\nLike أَسْفَل, when أَوَّل can be used as an annexe noun as well, even when it is an adverb of time. For example\n\nكَانَ يَنَامُ أَوَّلَ اللَّيْلِ [صحيح مسلم :739]\n“He used to sleep the first [part] of the night”\n\nThe usage of أَوَّل as an annexe noun when it is an adverb of time is probably not as uncommon as it is for أَسْفَل.\n\n\n23.11.3.3 Non-adverbial use of أَوَّل\nJust like أَسْفَل, أَوَّل need not be used adverbially. Here it is as the comment of a sentence and an annexe noun:\n\nوَأَنَا أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِینَ [سورة الأنعام 6:163]\n“and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.”\n\nEven when used non-adverbially, أَوَّل may take tanwīn. For example, here it is the subject of إنَّ in the propped-state:\n\nإِنَّ لِلصَّلَاةِ أَوَّلًا وَآخِرًا [جامع الترمذي :151]\n“Indeed the prayer has a first [time] and a last [time]”\n\n\n\n\n23.11.4 بَعْد\n\nused for time and place\nmeaning “yet”\n\n\n\n23.11.5 ذَات",

Whereas, the absolute doee can occur for any verb, whether transitive or intransitive Also, the absolute doee is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter, if Allāh wills.\nThe absolute doee is used for the following purposes:",

Consider again our earlier example:\n\nضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا\n“Zayd beat Ɛamr a beating”\n\nThe absolute doee ضَرْبًا signifies that beating actually ocurred, as if to counter any possible suspicion that it didn’t.

    "section": "24.3 The qualifying absolute doee",
    "text": "24.3 The qualifying absolute doee\nWith regard to the meaning of the governing verb, the qualifying absolute doee indicates either what kind was intended, or its quantity, or both.\nThe kind of the maṣdar is frequently used with a describer or in an annexation. For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/54A]\n“I beat him (with) a severe beating.”\nضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَ ٱلظَّالِمِ [Wright 2/54B]\n“He beat him (with) the beating of an oppressor.”\n\nSuch a qualifying absolute doee may also be signified simply with the definite article ٱل.4. For example, if a specific kind of beating is known before-hand to both the speaker and addressee, then the speaker may simply say:\n\nأَضْرِبُهُ ٱلضَّرْبَ\n“I will beat him (with) the beating.”\n\nThe qualifying maṣdar may also be annexed to a pronoun referring to the doer of the verb. For example,\n\nضَرَبَ ضَرْبَهُ\n“He beat him (with) his beating”\n\nThe quantity of the maṣdar often uses the one-time noun. It may be dualized or pluralized. For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرَبْةً وَضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ أَوْ ضَرَبَاتٍ [Wright 2/53D]\n“I beat him one blow and he beat me two blows or (three or more) blows.”\n\nSome maṣdars themselves end with a ة, like تِلَاوَة, so they are readily dualized or pluralized5 (to the sound āt plural) without resorting to the one-time noun. For example,\n\nتَلَا ٱلْقَارِئُ تِلَاوَاتٍ\n“The reader recited recitations.”\n\nBut in reality, when a maṣdar is dualized or pluralized in this manner, it seems to leave its maṣdar meaning, which is purely a verbal meaning, and begins to denote a concrete or abstract noun.6 So تِلَاوَات will denote, not so much the actions of reciting but kinds of recitations.\nThe same goes for maṣdars that don’t end with a ة but for whom a broken plural has been recorded from Classical Arabic, like عُلُوم, which is the plural of عِلْم “knowledge”, and وُعُود which is the plural of وَعْد “promise”.\nSo we can say:\n\nوَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا\n“I promised you promises.”\n\nوُعُود here refers to different kinds or occasions of promises, rather than the purely verbal actions of promising.7\nPlurals have not been recorded for all maṣdars. For example, ضَرْب does not have a recorded plural for its maṣdar meaning of “beating”.\nSo can we pluralize it if we wish to say “I beat him (many) kinds of beatings”? Some authorities allow us to form a new broken plural if there is a need.8 So according to them we should be able to coin a new plural ضُرُوب9 “beatings” and say,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ ضُرُوبًا\n“I beat him (many kinds of) beatings”\n\nOther authorities are more conservative and would only allow using broken plurals for existing meanings of words if one has been recorded for them. Following this opinion, we might then say:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ أَنْوَاعًا مِنَ ٱلضَّرْبِ\n“I beat him (many) kinds of beatings”\n\nIn any case, any maṣdar may at least be dualized to indicate the kinds of its action.10 So we can say:\n\nضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ [Wright 2/55D]\n“He beat me two (kinds of) beatings.”\nor\n“He beat me (on) two (occasions of) beatings.”\n\nBy the way, you should be able to see that saying ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ is different from if we had said\n\nضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ\n“He beat me (with) two blows.”\n\nThe former signifies the kinds or occasions of beating whereas the latter indicates the number of individual acts of beating.\nBy the way, for maṣdars that themselves end with ة, if we wish to specify that the action ocurred only once, we cannot, of course, form a one-time noun by appending another ة to it. In such a case, we may qualify the maṣdar with the describer وَاحِدَة “once”. For example:\n\nرَحِمَهُ رَحْمَةً وَاحِدَةً [Wright 1/123C]\n“He took one mercy upon him.”\n\nIt is also important to mention that the qualifying absolute doee includes the reinforcing meaning.11 We cannot use the qualifying absolute doee without also emphasizing the meaning of the verb. For example,\n\nفَٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا [سورة المعارج 70:5]\n“So be patient with gracious patience”\n\nIn section (ref), we will see that in order to only qualify the verb without emphasizing it, we can substitute the verb with the absolute doee which then becomes a deputy to the verb.12\nFinally, the qualifying absolute doee may qualify both the kinds and quantity of the meaning of the verb. For example:\n\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ قِرَاءَتَيْنِ نَافِعَتَيْنِ [النحو الوافي 2/209]\n“I read the book two useful readings.”",

    "section": "24.4 The deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee",
    "text": "24.4 The deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee\nFrequently, instead of using the maṣdar as the absolute doee directly, it is substituted by another word. This word is then called the deputy to the maṣdar as an absolute doee because it fulfils the absolute doee’s role. The maṣdar may still figure in the expression. It will just not technically be the absolute doee, because the first propped-state doee in that position is now its deputy.\nThe deputy to the maṣdar can be one of several categories:\n\nA describer to a deleted maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/54A]\n“I beat him severely.”\n(for ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا “I beat him a severe beating.”)\nسِرْتُ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ [أوضح المسالك إلى ألفية ابن مالك لابن هشام 2/184]\n“I travelled the best (kind) of travelling.”\n(for سِرْتُ ٱلسَّيْرِ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ)\n\nWhen the maṣdar is thus substituted with its describer, then the masculine adjectival noun is typically used for the describer, even if the maṣdar was a feminine noun. For example:\n\nكَتَبُوا سَرِيعًا\n“They wrote quickly.”\n(for كَتَبُوا كِتَابَةً سَرِيعَةً)\n\nThis is because even when maṣdars end with a feminine marker, they are abstract enough in their meaning that when they are absent, only the idea of them retains influence, not their actual wording. And because that abstract idea is not feminine in its meaning, it doesn’t cause the describer to match the feminine wording of the maṣdar in gender. So, by default, the masculine adjectival noun is used for the describer.\nAlso, the propped-state adjectival noun in such phrases as ضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا may, where the sense allows or requires it, be a deputy to the adverb of time instead of a deputy to the absolute doee.13 For example: سَارُوا طَوِيلًا “They travelled a long time,” (for سَارُوا زَمَنًا طَوِيلًا. See section (ref).)\nIn fact, according to some authorities, when the propped-state noun in such phrases could be applied to both a deleted absolute doee or a deleted adverb of time (or, for that matter, other propped-state functions like a direct doee), then it is possible that both meanings could be intended.14 For example,\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ كَثِيرًا\n“I beat him a lot.”\n\nThis sentence could mean, at the same time, both ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا كَثِيرًا “I beat him a lot [of beatings],” and ضَرَبْتُهُ زَمَنًا كَثِيرًا “I beat him (for) a lot [of time].”\n\n\nAn quasi-maṣdar\nThe quasi-maṣdar may be a regular common noun that is used in place of a verb’s maṣdar (see (ref)).\nFor example:\n\nفَرَجَعَ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَسْلِمُوا فَإِنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يُعْطِي عَطَاءً لاَ يَخْشَى الْفَاقَةَ [صحيح مسلم :2312a]\n“So he returned to his people and said, ‘O my people, embrace Islām for indeed Muḥammad gives a gift not fearing want.’”\n(عَطَاء “gift” is a quasi-maṣdar for the actual maṣdar إِعْطَاء.)\nٱنْهَزَمُوا هَزِيمَةً شَنِيعَةً\n[Wright 2/56B]\n“They were defeated an atrocious defeat”\n(The maṣdar of ٱنْهَزَمَ is properly ٱنْهِزَام)\n\nAlso falling under the category of quasi-maṣdar is the maṣdar of another form of the verb from the same root.15. For example:\n\nٱقْتَتَلُوا قِتَالًا شَدِيدًا [Wright 2/56B]\n“They fought with one another a hard fight”\n(قِتَال is properly the maṣdar of the form 3 verb قَاتَلَ)\nوَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلًا [سورة المزمل 73:8]\n“and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion”\n(تَبْتِيل is properly the maṣdar of the form 2 verb بَتَّلَ)\n\n\n\nA synonymous maṣdar from a different root\nFor example:\n\nجَلَسَ قُعُودًا [Wright 2/56C]\n“I sat (with) a sitting”\n\n\n\nA noun that indicates the type of maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nرَجَعَ ٱاْقَهْقَرَىٰ [Wright 2/56C]\n“He returned walking backwards.”\nقَهْقَرَىٰ is a noun which means “backward walk”.\n\n\n\nA noun of kind of the pattern فِعْلَة\nFor example:\n\nمشى القط مشية الأسد [النحو الوافي 2/218]\n“The cat walked (with) the gait of a lion”\n\n\n\nThe number of the maṣdar\nFor example:\n\nضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثَ ضَرَبَاتٍ\n“I beat him three blows”\n\nThe maṣdar may also be omitted from the base noun such that only the number remains. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثًا\n“I beat him three (blows)”\n(Note the feminine number ثَلَاث instead of the masculine ثَلَاثَة because the deleted base noun will be feminine in such circumstances.)\n\n\n\nA partial or whole fraction\nWords like كُلّ, جَمِيع “all”; بَعْض “some”; نِصْف, شَطْر “half”, etc. can be used to indicate how much of an action is done.\nFor example:\n\nفَلَا تَيِيلُوا كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ [سورة النساء 4:129]\n“So do not incline completely [toward one]”\nأَهْمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ بَعْضَ ٱلْإِهْمَالِ [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/452]\n“The student was negligent somewhat”\n\nIncluded in this category is the word شَيْء “thing”. When used in the propped-state governed by a verb it can signify the meaning “a bit” or “somewhat”, etc.16 For example:\n\nفَسَارَ عَلِيٌّ شَيْـًٔا ثُمَّ وَقَفَ [صحيح مسلم :2405]\n“So Ɛaliyy went a bit, then he stopped”\n\nThe propped-state noun شَيْـًٔا isn’t always a absolute doee after a verb. It may be, depending on the meaning of the sentence, a direct doee. For example, in the وَجَدْتُ شَيْـًٔا “I found something.” However, in some circumstances, شَيْـًٔا may make sense both as an absolute doee and as a direct doee.17 For example:\n\nوَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النساء 4:36]\n“and associate nothing with Him”\n\nRegarding this āyah, the mufassir Ibn Ɛās͡hūr says:\n\nشَيْـًٔا is in the propped-state due to its being a [direct] doee for تُشْرِكُوا, i.e. “Don’t make a partner anything from what is worshipped”, similar to His saying, ولَنْ نُشْرِكَ بِرَبِّنا أحَدًا [سورة الجن 72:2] (“And we will never associate with our Lord anyone”).\nAnd it is permissible that شَيْـًٔا is in the propped-state due to its being [a deputy to] the maṣdar, i.e. “a bit of associating even if it is slight”, similar to His saying, فَلَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْـًٔا [سورة المائدة 5:42] (“never will they harm you at all.”).18\n\n\n\n\nThe instrument or implement used in the action\nThe type of action may be indicated with the the instrument or implement used in the action. For example:\n\nضَرَبْتُهُ سَوْطًا [Wright 2/56D]\n“I beat him (with) a whip.”\n(for ضَرْبَ سَوْطٍ)\n\n\n\nA pronoun\nA absolute doee can be substituted by a pronoun that refers to it.19 For example:\n\nأَحْسَنَ ٱلْإِكْرَامَ وَأَكْرَمَهُ ضَيْفَهُ\n“He perfected generosity and was generous (with it) [to] his guest.”\n(i.e., he was generous with the generosity)\n\n\n\nA pointing noun\nSimilar to the pronoun as a deputy maṣdar absolute doee, a pointing noun may be used in the same vein. For example\n\nٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُهَذَّبُ لاَ يُعَامِلُ ٱلنَّاسَ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْمُعَامَلَةَ [النحو الواضح لعلي الجارم 2/159]\n“The refined man does not deal with the people (with) this dealing.”\nيَحْفَظُونَ أَسْرَارَهُمْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْحِفْظَ [Wright 2/54A]\n“They keep their secrets (with) this keeping”\n(i.e. so carefully)",

    "section": "24.6 The absolute doee as a deputy of the deleted governing verb",
    "text": "24.6 The absolute doee as a deputy of the deleted governing verb\nIn some cases, the deleted governing verb is replaced by the absolute doee. The absolute doee is then a deputy of the deleted verb. This can be done in the following circumstances:\n\n24.6.1 The absolute doee as a deputy of the verb in a command or supplication\nFor example, instead of using the verb of command ٱصْبِرُوا “Be patient,” one may say:\n\nصَبْرًا\n“Patience”\n\nIn terms of governance, the complete sentence is ٱصْبِرُوا صَبْرًا.  The sentence ٱصْبِرُوا صَبْرًا is valid on its own right as a use of the reinforcing absolute doee. But that is not exactly what the utterance صَبْرًا, by itself, signifies. Rather the governing verb ٱصْبِرُوا. is substituted with the absolute doee, such that the verb is no longer present in meaning, and the absolute doee is now its deputy, fulfilling its role.\n\nWhy then would one choose to use a absolute doee instead of a verb?20 The maṣdar signifies only a meaning of the action of the verb. The verb signifies both the meaning of its maṣdar and is also linked to a time in which the action originates, continues, or renews. So the verb is more temporary than its maṣdar. Therefore, if we use a absolute doee instead of a verb, then it is not explicitly linked to any time, nor does it explicitly imply a renewal of the action. So the absolute doee as a deputy for the verb signifies a constancy and inseperableness of the action. Whereas the verb is a direct application of the action.\nSecondly, the verb is necessarily tied to its doer. So, also in circumstances where the objective is the action itself, and not who does it, the absolute doee may be used as a deputy to the verb.\nHere are some more examples of a absolute doee as a deputy for the verb:\n\nقَالَ أَبُو لَهَبٍ تَبًّا لَكَ أَلِهَذَا جَمَعْتَنَا فَنَزَلَتْ تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ [صحيح البخاري :4973]\n“Abū Lahab said: ‘A perishing for you! Is it for this (that) you have gathered us?’ So there was revealed: ‘May the hands of Abū Lahab be ruined’” [سورة المسد 111:1]\n(تَبًّا is a absolute doee of the verb تَبَّ “to perish”.)\nشُكْرًا لَكُمْ\n“A thanking for you”\n(for أَشْكُرُكَ “I thank you.”)\nسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ “The glorification of Allāh!”\n(سُبْحَانَ is a quasi-maṣdar for the verb سَبَّحَ “to glorify”.)\n\nIn the above example, the sentence with the verb could be, e.g., أُسَبِّحُ سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ “I glorify the glorification of Allāh.” But again, though this may be a valid sentence on its own right, it is not exactly what the utterance سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّـٰهِ, by itself, signifies. The quasi-maṣdar سُبْحَان, as a deputy to the verb does not explicitly specify the verb or its doer. Rather, the quasi-maṣdar سُبْحَان replaces its governing verb. The purpose is to mention the glorification of Allāh without being limited by a time limit for the action of the verb, or a need to mention the doer of the verb.21\nSimilarly,\n\nمَعَاذَ ٱللَّـٰهِ\n“The refuge of Allāh”\n(مَعَاذ is a maṣdar of عَاذَ يَعُوذُ “to seek refuge”.)\n\n\nUsing the raised-state maṣdar instead of the absolute doee\nIn situations that call for a course of action, the raised-state maṣdar may optionally be used instead of using the (propped-state) absolute doee.\nFor example, in a situation that calls for patience, one might say\n\nصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ [معاني النحو 2/206]\n“A beautiful patience”\n\ninstead of saying صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا. Here, the implied meaning is ٱلْأَمْرُ فِيهِ صَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ “The thing to be done in the matter is a beautiful patience.”22\nThe raised-state maṣdar (instead of the propped-state absolute doee) has the force of more constancy and generality. Additionally, it can imply that the action called for has, in the speaker’s estimation, already begun and become established. Here are some more examples:\n\nرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّـٰهِ عَلَيْهِ [معاني النحو 2/206]\n“The mercy of Allāh on him”\nوَيْحٌ لِزَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\n“A mercy on Zayd”\n\nIn the above example, the following alternative (using the absolute doee) is also possible:\n\n\nوَيْحًا لِزَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\nوَيْحَ زَيْدٍ [Lane’s Lexicon, root ويح]\n“A mercy on Zayd”\n(as though one were to say: أَلْزَمَهُ ٱللَّـٰهُ وَيْحًا “May Allāh may mercy to attend him constantly!”)\n\n\nThe words وَيْل, وَيْب, and وَيْس are used in a similar manner to وَيْح above. These are all maṣdars of disused verbs. وَيْح and وَيْس typically signify compassion and a mild chiding. Whereas وَيْل and وَيْب typically signify a severe chiding, calling for misfortune and destruction.\n\n\n\n24.6.2 The absolute doee as a deputy of a verb that is a comment\nThere is a set of circumstances where the governing verb can deleted, and its place is taken by the absolute doee as its deputy. This is when the verb is the comment of a subject-comment sentence, and the verb’s maṣdar wouldn’t ordinarily be a comment in the raised-state for the subject.23\nHere are some examples that should illustrate what we mean:\nConsider the sentence أَنْتَ تَأْكُلُ وَتَشْرَبُ “You are eating and drinking.” The verbs in this sentence may be deleted and each is substituted with its propped-state absolute doees as a deputy. So we can say:\n\nأَنْتَ أَكْلًا وَشُرْبًا [معاني النحو 2/208]\n“You are eating and drinking.”\n(for أَنْتَ تَأْكُلُ وَتَشْرَبُ)\n\nWhat allows this is that the maṣdars أَكْل شُرْب wouldn’t oridinarily work as raised-state comments for this subject. That is, we can’t say \\(\\times\\) أَنْتَ أَكْلٌ وَشُرْبٌ. So when we use the maṣdars in the propped-state as absolute doees (أَنْتَ أَكْلًا وَشُرْبًا), it is understood that they are acting as a deputy for their respected deleted verbs.\nHere are some more examples:\n\nٱلْمَطَرُ سَحًّا سَحًّا [النحو الوافي 2/225]\n“The rain (is) pouring (and) pouring.”\n(سَحّ is the maṣdar of the verb سَحَّ يَسُحُّ “to pour down abundantly (of rain)”)\n\n\n\nمَا ٱلْأَسَدُ مَعَ فَرِيسَتِهِ إِلَّا فَتْكًا [النحو الوافي 2/226]\n“The lion is not, with his prey, [anything] but slaying”\n(فَتْك is the maṣdar of فَتَكَ يَفْتُكُ “to assault and slay”)\nأَسَفَاهَةً وَأَنْتَ مُثَقَّفٌ؟ [النحو الوافي 2/222]\n“[Do you act] foolishly while you are an educated [person]?”\n(سَفَاهَة is the maṣdar of سَفِهَ يَسْفَهُ “to be foolish”)\n\nAs you can see from the examples above, these circumstances are usually limited to one of the following kind of sentences:\n\na repeated maṣdar\nmultiple maṣdars joined with conjunctive particles\na restricted maṣdar\na maṣdar that is asked about in a question\n\n\n\n24.6.3 The absolute doee as a deputy for a verb in detailing a vague consequential action\nThis is a very specific circumstance where the absolute doee may occur as a deputy to a verb. Consider an action that is done as a consequence of some matter. If this consequential action is expressed only vaguely, then the following sentence can add detail to this vague action using absolute doees.24 Here is an example:\n\nإِنْ أَسَاءَ إِلَيْكَ ٱلصَّدِيقُ فَٱسْلُكْ مَسْلَكَ ٱلْعُقَلَاءِ. فَإٍمَّا عِتَابًا كَرِيمًا وَإِمَّا صَفْحًا جَمِيلًا [النحو الوافي 2/224]\nIf a friend does you wrong then take the path of the intelligent: So either an honorable reproving or a gracious pardoning”\n\nIn the example above, the consequential vague action is فَٱسْلُكْ مَسْلَكَ ٱلْعُقَلَاءِ “take the path of the intelligent”. The maṣdars عِتَاب “reproving” and صَفْح “pardoning” are then used as absolute doees to detail this vague action, فَإٍمَّا عِتَابًا كَرِيمًا وَإِمَّا صَفْحًا جَمِيلًا “So either an honorable reproving or a gracious pardoning.”25\n\n\n24.6.4 The absolute doee as a deputy for a verb in emphasizing the meaning of an entire sentence\nOne usage of the absolute doee as a deputy for a verb is in emphasizing the meaning of an entire sentence. The absolute doee in such cases are maṣdars (or quasi-maṣdars) like:\n\nحَقًّا “truly” for أُحِقُّ حَقًّا “I assert a truth”\nيَقِينًا “certainly” for أُوقِنُ يَقِينًا “I ascertain a certainty”\n\nFor example,\n\nتَبَدَّى لَهُ جِبْرِيلُ فَقَالَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ إِنَّكَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ حَقًّا [صحيح البخاري :6982]\n“Gabriel would appear before him and say, ‘O Muḥammad! Indeed you are Allāh’s Messenger ﷺ truly’”\nوَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا [سورة النساء 4:157]\n“And they did not kill him, for certain.”\n\n\n\n24.6.5 The dualized absolute doee as a deputy of the verb\nThere are some absolute doees that are dualized and annexed to a pronoun in set phrases. The dual indicates a recurringness of the action. These include:\n\nلَبَّيْكَ – لَبّ is the quasi-maṣdar of the verb أَلَبّ يُلِبُّ “to remain.” The propped-state dualized maṣdar annexed to the addressee pronoun, لَبَّيْكَ, signifies “I remain for you (i.e. at your service] time after time.” A verb لَبَّىٰ يُلَبِّي تَلْبِيَةً “to utter لَبَّيْكَ” is derived from this phrase.\nسَعْدَيْكَ – سَعْد is the quasi-maṣdar of the verb أَسْعَدَ يُسْعِدُ “to help” The propped-state dualized maṣdar annexed to the addressee pronoun, سَعْدَيْكَ, signifies “I am at your aid time after time.”\nحَنَانَيْكَ – from حَنَان “mercy”. حَنَانَيْكَ signifies “Let your mercy be continuous to me.”\nدَوَالَيْكَ – from دَوَال which is equivalent to مُدَاوَلَة and تَدَاوُل “taking by turns”. دَوَالَيْكَ signifies “Make (you) the action to be done by turns.”\nحَذَارَيْكَ – from حَذَار “Beware”. حَذَارَيْكَ signifies “Twice beware!”",

    "section": "24.7 Differentiating the absolute doee from the other propped-state doees",
    "text": "24.7 Differentiating the absolute doee from the other propped-state doees\nThe absolute doee is a kind of doee. Other kinds of doees include the direct doee, the adverb of time and the adverb of place, and the adverb of reason. Generally, all adverbs can be considered to be in the category of doees. All doees are governed by verbs and occur in the propped-state.\nSometimes it is not easy to disambiguate the exact function of an propped-state noun occurring as a doee. We have already seen some instances of this. For example, we mentioned that in example (21) ضَرَبْتُهُ كَثِيرًا, that the propped-state doee كَثِيرًا could be analyzed as either a absolute doee or a adverb of time, depending on context.\nSimilarly, in example (34) وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْـًٔا [سورة النساء 4:36] “and associate nothing with Him”, شَيْـًٔا has been analyzed to support both a absolute doee meaning and a direct doee meaning.\nFor some verbs, their maṣdars are re-used as common nouns. For example:\n\nأَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا – أَكْل is re-used to mean “a food”\nصَادَ يَصِيدُ صَيْدًا – صَيْد is re-used to mean “a prey”\nقَالَ يَقُولُ قَوْلًا – قَوْل is re-used to mean “a saying” or “a speech”\nسَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا – سُؤَال is re-used to mean “a question”\n\nWhen these nouns are in the propped-state governed by their verb, then how do we tell whether they are a absolute doee or a direct doee? For example:\n\nأَكَلَ زَيْدٌ أَكْلًا\n“Zayd ate an eating.”\nor\n“Zayd ate a food.”\n\nBy itself, أَكْلًا supports both functions of the direct doee and the absolute doee. And we have to look at context to see which of the two meanings the speaker intended.\nSometimes, if the propped-state doee is qualified, then that can help us distinguish between the two functions. For example,\n\nأَكَلَ زَيْدٌ أَكْلًا سَرِيعًا\n“Zayd ate a fast eating”\n(i.e. “Zayd ate quickly.”)\n\n\nIn the above example, the describer سَرِيع “fast” is applied to the describee أَكْلًا. Now, unless Zayd was eating “fast food” (unlikely in classical times), the describer applies to the manner in which Zayd was eating. Hence أَكْلًا is a absolute doee and not a direct doee.\nSometimes, the qualifier may be applicable to both the absolute doee and the doee. Yet each meaning will be distinct. For example,\n\nصَادَ زَيْدٌ صَيْدَ ٱلْأَسَدِ\n“Zayd hunted (in the manner of) the hunting of a lion.”\nor\n“Zayd hunted the lion’s prey.”\n\nIn the above example, the doee صَيْد is qualified in an annexation with the base noun ٱلْأَسَد “the lion”. But the qualifier is applicable to both meanings of صَيْد: the absolute doee meaning: “hunting”, and the direct doee meaning: “prey”. When applied to the absolute doee meaning then the sentence means that Zayd hunted in a ferocious and daring manner, like a lion does. And when applied to the direct doee meaning then the sentence means that Zayd hunted a prey which was (previously) the prey of a lion. However, both of these meanings are distinct from each other. In this sort of case, context should help in figuring out the intended meaning.\nIn the case of maṣdars like أَكْل and صَيْد, when they are re-used as common nouns, then their existence is not tied to the action of the verb. For example, أَكْل, meaning “food”, exists prior to the action of eating. And صَيْد, meaning “prey” exists prior to the action of hunting.\nBut in the case of maṣdars like قَوْل and سُؤَال, even when they are a direct doee, they only come into existence with the action of their verb. So there is no قَوْل, either as a absolute doee or as a direct doee, before the action of “saying” And there is no سُؤَال, either as a absolute doee or as a direct doee, before the action of “asking”.\nIn such cases, even when a qualifier is applied, the line between the absolute doee and the direct doee can remain blurry. And that is not really a big deal because both meanings will be similar. For example,\n\nسَأَلَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا سُؤَالًا صَعْبًا\n“He asked a difficult questioning.”\n(i.e. the questioning was difficult upon Ɛamr)\nor\n“He asked a difficult question.”\n\nThis sort of ambiguity can sometimes be found in the other adverb doees as well.",

But we have seen (in sections (ref)), that nouns that have a verbal quality to them, like the maṣdar, the doer participle, etc., can also govern a doer and a doee.\nSo a absolute doee may occur, governed by either a verb (as we have seen), or a doer participle, or a doee participle, or a quasi-participle, or even another maṣdar.\nHere are some examples:\n\nفَرَحْتُ بِٱجْتِهَادِكَ ٱجْتِهَادًا حَسَنًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/449]\n“I rejoiced at your striving a good striving”\n(the absolute doee ٱجْتِهَادًا is governed by the preceding maṣdar ٱجْتِهَاد)\nأَنَا مُكْرِمٌ خَالِدًا إِكْرَامًا عَظِيمًا [النحو العربي: أحكام ومعان 1/449]\n“I will honor K͡hālid a great honoring.”\n(the absolute doee إِكْرَامًا is governed by the doer participle مُكْرِم)",

    "text": "25.2 Forming the passive verb\nSo far we have been studing form 1 verbs, which use only the three root letters. As we know, the vowel on the middle root letter is variable for active verbs, for example:\n\nشَرِبَ يَشْرَبُ “to drink”.\nفَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ “to open”\nكَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ “to become big”\netc.\n\nThe pattern of passive verb for form 1 verbs is always:\nفُعِلَ يُفْعَلُ\nfuɛila yufɛalu\nThis is regardless of the vowel on the middle root letter in the active verb. If there is more than one verb from the same root, with different middle root letter vowels for the active verb, then they will share the same passive verb. For example, the active verbs: حَسَبَ يَحْسُبُ “to reckon” and حَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ “to deem” share the same passive verb: حُسِبَ يُحْسَبُ.\nThe same doer pronouns are used for the passive verb as for the active verb. And the passive resembling verb has the same three states as the active resembling verb. For example:\n\nفُعِلُوا fuɛilū “they3m” (past)\nتُفْعَلَانِ tufɛalāni “you2” or “they2f” (raised-state resembling)\nأُفْعَلَ ʾufɛala “I” (propped-state resembling)\netc.\n\nThe complete table showing the doer pronouns is given in appendix @ref(verb-tables).",

    "section": "25.3 The deputy doer",
    "text": "25.3 The deputy doer\nConsider again this sentence with an passive verb construction:\n\n\nNote that the noun ٱَلْمَاءُ ʾalmāʾu “the water” is in the raised-state. This is because, in the absence of the doer, the direct doee of the active verb (ٱَلْمَاءَ) is deputized to take doer’s place in the raised-state. It is then known as the deputy doer.\nThe doer pronouns for the passive verb shall therefore match the gender and number of the deputy doer. Here are some examples:\nشُكِرَتِ ٱلأُمَّهَاتُ وَمُدِحْنَ.\ns͡hukirati -lʾummahātu wamudiḥn.\n“The mothers were thanked and praised.”\nأَنْتُمَا تُغْبَنَانِ وَتُخْدَعَانِ.\nʾantumā tug͡hbanāni watuk͡hdaɛān.\n“You2 are being cheated and deceived.”\nمَا قُطِعَتِ ٱلشَّجَرَةُ.\nmā quṭiɛati -s͡hs͡hajarah.\n“The tree was not cut.”\n\n25.3.1 The deputy doer for multiple direct doees\nSome verbs, in the active construction, take multiple direct doee. These verbs can be classified into two classes: \n\nVerbs that cause the first direct doee to be affected by, or asked for, the second direct doee. Examples: \nمَلَأَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلدَّلْوَ مَاءً.\n“The boy filled the bucket (with) water.”\nمَنَعَ ٱلْمَرَضُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلْعَمَلَ.\n“Sickness prevented the man (from) work.”\nسَأَلَ ٱلْفَقِيرُ ٱلْغَنِيَّ دِرْهَمًا.\n“The poor [man] asked the rich [man] (for) a dirham.”\nVerbs that siginify an action of the heart or of intention, like thinking, deeming, making, etc. Examples:\nحَسِبْتُ زَيْدًا صَدِيقًا.\n“I deemed Zayd [to be] a friend”\nوَجَدَتِ ٱلطَّالِبَةُ ٱلْأُسْتَاذَةَ حَلِيمَةً.\n“The studentf found the professorf [to be] forbearing.”\nجَعَلَ ٱللَّـٰهُ ٱلْمَاءَ بَرَكَةً.\n“Allāh has made the water a blessing.”\n\nWhen such verbs are converted to the passive verb construction, then one, and only one, direct doee shall be chosen to be the deputy doer. It is generally preferred to make the first direct doee the deputy-doer, and leave the second direct doee, as is, in the propped-state. Here are the same sentences in the passive construction:\nمُلِئَتِ ٱلدَّلْوُ مَاءً. (دَلْو “bucket” is feminine.)\n“The bucket was filled (with) water.”\nمُنِعَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْعَمَلَ.\n“The man was prevented (from) work.”\nسُئِلَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ دِرْهَمًا.\n“The rich [man] was asked for a dirham.”\nحُسِبَ زَيْدٌ صَدِيقًا.\n“Zayd was deemed [to be] a friend”\nوُجِدَتِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذَةُ حَلِيمَةً.\n“The professorf was found [to be] forbearing.”\nجُعِلَ ٱلْمَاءُ بَرَكَةً.\n“Water has been made a blessing.”",

    "section": "25.4 Impersonal use",
    "text": "25.4 Impersonal use\nWhen verbs are used without a direct doee, then their passive construction gives in an impersonal meaning. There are a few such usages that we will explain in the following subsections.\n\n25.4.1 With prepositional phrases\nSome verbs take no direct doees, but are used with prepositional phrases. For example,\nجَلَسَ ٱلنَّاسُ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.\n“The people sat upon the ground.”\nOther verbs, which can take a direct doee, may be used without one, and again with a prepositional phrase instead. For example:\nكَتَبَ ٱلْكَاتِبُ بِٱلْقَلَمِ.\n“The scribe wrote with the pen.”\nWhen such sentences are converted to the passive verb construction then the prepositional phrase may be taken as the deputy doer. However, the preposition causes the noun following it to remain in the lowered-state. So the deputy doer is not indicated by an apparent ḍammah (or by the other indicators of the raised-state). The verb then appears to be in the singular masculine, with its deputy doer following it. For example:\n\n\nكُتِبَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ.\n“The pen was written with.”\n\n\n25.4.2 With adverbs of time or place\nOther verbs don’t take a direct doee but may be used with an adverb of time or place in the propped-state. (We will study adverbs of time and place in chapter @ref(adverbs-of-time-and-place), if Allāh wills.) Here is an example:\n\n\nWhen this sentence is converted to an passive construction then the adverb of time or place can be taken as the deputy doer in the raised-state:\nسُهِرَتْ لَيلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ.\n“The Night of Power was stayed up [in].”\nNote the raised-state of لَيْلَةُ laylatu as the deputy doer.\n\n\n25.4.3 With the maṣdar\nThe maṣdar, because it is the action being done may be considered a kind of direct doee. (We will study the use of the maṣdar as a doee in chapter @ref(absolute-doee), if Allāh wills.) For example:\nفَهِمَ ٱلشَّيْخُ فَهْمًا عَمِيقًا.\n“The old man understood, a deep understanding.”\nWhen such sentences are converted to the passive verb construction, then the maṣdar may be taken as the deputy doer in the raised-state.\nفُهِمَ فَهْمٌ عَمِيقٌ.\n“A deep understanding was understood.”\n\n\n25.4.4 Requirement of specialization\nWhen a prepositional phrase, or an adverb of time or place, or a maṣdar is to be used as a deputy doer in an passive verb construction, then it is required that they be specialized in meaning, and not used in a general sense. So for example, if we have the sentence:\nسَهَرَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ لَيلَةً.\n“The mother stayed up a night.”\nthen because of the non-specialized meaning of لَيْلَةً, such a sentence is typically not suitable for being converted to a passive verb construction.\n\n\n25.4.5 Choosing the deputy doer\nIf a sentence is to be converted to an passive verb construction and it has more than one of the following:\n\na direct doee\na specialized prepositional phrase\na specialized adverb of time or place\na specialized maṣdar\n\nThen only one shall be chosen as the deputy doer. If a direct doee exists, then it is typically chosen. If a direct doee does not exist, then the one desired to be emphasized may be chosen as the deputy doer. For example:\nسُهِرَ فِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ لَيلَةَ ٱلْقَدْرِ.\n“The mosque was stayed up in [on] the Night of Power.”\nIn the above sentence the prepositional phrase فِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ was chosen as the deputy doer, and the adverb of time لَيْلَةَ remains, as is, in the propped-state.",

The three states are used in the same circumstances, and with the same rules that we have already learned.\nSo the raised-state verb is used for making plain statements:\nتُذْكَرُ قِصَّةُ ٱلْمَلِكِ فِي كُتُبِ ٱلتَّأْرِيخِ.\n“The story of the king is mentioned in the books of history.”\nلَا تُرْفَعُ ٱلْأَصْوَاتُ فِي ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ.\n“Voices are not raised in the library.”\nThe propped-state verb is used for expressing wish or purpose:\nيَأْمُلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ أَنْ يُغْفَرُ لَهُمْ.\n“The Muslims hope that they be forgiven.”\n(Note that يُغْفَرَ has a singular masculine deputy doer because there is no direct doee.)\nلَنْ تُسْمَعَا.\n“You2 shall not be heard.”\nدُفِعَ ٱلْبَابُ حَتَّىٰ يُفْتَحَ.\n“The door was pushed for the result that it open.”\nSimilarly, the clipped-state verb is used in the following cases:\n\nWith لَمْ “was not”:\nلَمْ يُؤْذَنْ لِي أَنْ أَدْخُلَ.\n“It was not permitted for me that I enter.”\nWith لَمَّا “not yet”\nلَمَّا يُكْتَبْ كِتَابٌ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْمَوْضُوعِ.\n“A book has not yet been written in this subject.”\nWith لِ for indirect commands1:\nلِيُسْمَعْ صَوْتُهُ!\n“Let his voice be heard!”\nThere is no verb of command for passive verbs. So while indirect commands are typically not used for the addressee participant for active verbs (see section @ref(indirect-commands)), they are the only way to issue commands for the addressee participant in the passive verb construction:\nلِتُنْصَرُوا!\n“Let you3m be aided!”",

    "section": "25.6 Usage of the passive verb",
    "text": "25.6 Usage of the passive verb\nThere are cases where it is permissible to use of the passive verb construction, and cases where it is not permissible to use of the passive verb construction. We will explain them below:\n\n25.6.1 Permissible use of the passive verb\nThere can be a number of reasons why a speaker is forced to, or chooses to, use the passive verb construction. Among these reasons are:\n\nWhen the doer is actually unknown to the speaker. This is the classic use-case, as indicated by the name passive verb. (But, as we shall see below, it is not the only use case.) So, if we say:\nكُسِرَتِ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ.\n“The glass was broken.”\nthen, it may be that we don’t know who broke the glass, and that is why we are expressing it in the passive verb construction.\nWhen the doer is known to the speaker, but he does not wish to make him known to others. So the same sentence above كُسِرَتِ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ. could be used when the speaker knows that it was actually زَيْد “Zayd”, for example, who broke the glass, but the speaker does not wish that others find out that it was Zayd. This itself could be for any reason, for example: the speaker fears Zayd, for fears for Zayd, etc.\nWhen the speaker wishes to draw attention to the act itself rather than the doer of the act. So we might say:\nمُنِعْنَا ٱلدُّخُولَ.\n“We have been prevented from entering.”\nwhen we wish to focus on the act of our having been prevented, rather than who prevented us.\nFor stylistic reasons, when it is obvious and known who the doer is. For example:\nخُلِقَ ٱلْإِنْسَانُ مِنْ ْعَجَلٍ\n“Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience].” (Qurʾān 21:37. Trans. Saheeh International)\nIn the above ʾāyah it is known and obvious that Allāh created man.\nIn order to glorify the doer. So we might the passive verb construction to say:\nخُلِقَ ٱلْخِنْزِيرُ.\n“The pig was created.”\nThis could be to distance Allāh from being mentioned next to the name of a particularly dirty animal.\nWhen the doer is not mentioned due to contempt for him. For example:\nقُتِلَ أَمِيرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عُمَرُ.\n“The Commander of the believers, Ɛumar, was killed.”\nIn this sentence we chose not to name the killer due to contempt for him.\n\nThese reasons are not mutually exclusive, and sometimes the passive verb construction is used for a combination of them.\n\n\n25.6.2 Impermissible use of the passive verb\nThe passive verb may not be used when the doer is mentioned with the verb. This is different from English which can use the word “by” to indicate the doer in a passive voice construction, as in: “The book was written by Zayd.”. Such a sentence, in Arabic can only be expressed with the active verb construction:\nكَتَبَ زَيْدٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nkataba zayduni -lkitāb.\n“Zayd wrote the book.”\nIt may seem like this rule is broken in sentences like:\nقُتِلَ بِٱلسَّيْفِ.\nqutila bi-ssayf.\n“He was killed by the sword.”\nBut such is not the case. The active verb constuction would be something like:\nقَتَلَهُ فُلَانٌ بِٱلسَّيْفِ.\nqatalahu fulānun bi-ssayf.\n“So-and-so killed him with the sword.”\nAs you can see, فُلَان “so-and-so” is actually the doer, and ٱلسَّيْف “the sword” is merely a prepositional phrase indicating the instrument used in the act.",

    "section": "26.3 The doer participle as a noun",
    "text": "26.3 The doer participle as a noun\nLike the maṣdar, the doer participle occupies a place that is between a noun and a verb. The basic, most essential, meaning of the doer participle is that of a noun which denotes the doer of the verb.\nSo, for example, consider the verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا “to question”. Its doer participle is سَائِل. Since it refers to the doer of this verb, we can translate it as “a questionerm.”.\nBy itself, the word سَائِل “a questioner” just denotes a noun. It does not indicate when the doer does the action of the verb: has the questioner already asked the question, is he asking it at present, or will he ask it in the future? So, for example, we can say:\nسَيَقْدَمُ سَائِلٌ وَسَيَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا.\nsayaqdamu sāʾilun wasayaqdamu suʾālan.\n“A questionerm. will arrive and he will ask a question.”\nIn the above sentence, the doer participle is being described as performing the action of the verb in the future.\nHere is another example:\nسَأَلَتِ ٱلْفَقِيهَ سَائِلَةٌ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.\nsaʾalati -lfaqīha sāʾilatun ɛan ʾamrin.\n“A questionerf. asked the jurist about a matter.”\nIn the above sentence, the doer participle is being described as having performed the action of the verb in the past.\nDoer participles of form 1 verbs, when used with this nounal meaning, often have broken plurals, in addition to their sound plurals. Generally, either could be used in most cases, but the usage of the broken plurals is preferred.\nFor example, consider the verb قَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا “to kill (ه s.o.)”. Its doer participle is قَاتِل “a killerm.”. Its sound plural is قَاتِلُونَ qātilūna and its broken plurals are قُتَّال quttāl and قَتَلَة qatalah. Any of these could be used but the broken plural is often preferred.\nهَرَبَ قَتَلَةُ ٱلرَّجُلِ إِلَىٰ مَخْبَئِهِمْ.\nharaba qatalatu -rrajuli ʾilā mak͡hbaʾihim.\n“The killers of the man fled to their hideout.”",

    "text": "26.4 The doer participle as a verb\nWe have learned that the essential meaning of the doer participle is the doer of the action of the verb from which it is derived. In addition to this essential meaning, the doer participle can also be used in place of the verb from which it is derived. This is only done when the verb to be replaced is the resembling verb. The doer participle does not replace the past verb. We will now explain this usage.\n\n26.4.1 Usage of the doer participle as a present tense verb\nConsider the following sentence:\nيَذْهَبُ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.\nyad͡h·habu zaydun ʾila -lmadrasati.\n“Zayd goes to school.”\nThe above sentence does not explicitly specify whether Zayd is actually going to school at present, or that he goes to school habitually and not necessarily right now.\nIf we wish to indicate that Zayd is actually going to school at present we can replace the resembling verb with the indefinite doer participle. So we get:\nزَيْدٌ ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.\nyad͡h·habu zaydun ʾila -lmadrasati.\n“Zayd is going to school.”\nNote that the same preposition إِلَىٰ ʾilā “to” is used with the doer participle as is used with the verb. Also note that this is now a subject-comment sentence instead of a verbal sentence. زَيْدٌ zaydun “Zayd” is the subject, and ذَاهِبٌ d͡hāhibun is part of the comment.\nThis usage of the doer participle to indicate that the action of the verb is ocurring at present is mostly done for what we call verbs of posture and verbs of motion.\nVerbs of posture denote a static position or activity of the doer’s body and include verbs like sitting, standing, lying down, sleeping, etc.\nVerbs of motion denote a moving action of the doer’s body and include verbs like going, coming, running, etc.\nSo, if, for example, we say,\nزَيْنَبُ جَالِسَةٌ عَلَى هَـٰذَا ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.\nzaynabu jālisatun ɛala hād͡ha -lkursiyyi.\n“Zaynab is sitting on this chair.”\nthis indicates that Zaynab is sitting on this chair at present. And if we say,\nتَجْلِسُ زَيْنَبُ عَلَى هَـٰذَا ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.\ntajlisu zaynabu ɛala hād͡ha -lkursiyyi.\n“Zaynab sits on this chair.”\nthis indicates that Zaynab usually sits on this chair.\nIf this usage of the doer participle to indicate a present action is mostly only for verbs of posture and motion, how then do we indicate this distinction for other verbs? We have answered this in section [TODO: add section to resembling verb] where we said that in order to give the meaning that the action of the verb is happening right now, a verbal sentence can be converted to a subject-comment sentence.\n\n\n26.4.2 Usage of the doer participle as a future tense verb {Doer participle-for-intended-future-action}\nThe doer participle may be used in place of the verb it is derived from to indicate an intent on the part of the doer, or to indicate that the action will occur in the future.\nThis usage of the doer participle is not just for verbs of posture and motion like the present tense usage. Rather, it is for all verbs in general.\nAnd since intention is something that is mostly expressed by the speaker for himself, rather than for someone else, we will often find this usage with the subject أَنَا ʾana “I”.\n\n26.4.2.1 With an indirect doee\nHere is an example of the usage of the doer participle as a future tense verb with an indirect doee:\n\nأَنَا ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ صَدِيقِي فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ.\nʾana d͡hāhibun ʾilā bayti ṣadīqī fi -ṣṣabāḥi.\n“I’m going to go to my friend’s house in the morning.”\nIn the above sentence it is possible for the phrase فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ fi -ṣṣabāḥi “in the morning” to be ommitted for the same meaning. In that case, surrounding context could tell us that the person is intending to go in the future, and is not actually in the process of going there at present.\nHere is another example (by a female speaker):\nعِنْدِي كُرَةٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ فَأَنَا رَاجِعَةٌ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ وَلَاعِبَةٌ بِهَا.\nɛindī kuratun fi -lbayti faʾana rājiɛatun ʾila -lbayti walāɛibatun bihā.\n“I have a ball at home, so I’m going to go home and play with it.”\n\n\n26.4.2.2 Difference with the particles سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa\nWe have already learned a method to express a future action using the particles سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa with the resembling verb. So we could also have said:\nسَأَذْهَبُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ صَدِيقِي.\nsaʾad͡h·habu ʾilā bayti ṣadīqī.\n“I will to go to my friend’s house.”\nThe difference between using the particles سَـ sa- and سَوْفَ sawfa and using the doer participle is that using the doer participle signifies more emphasis, or, as a possible consequence of the emphasis, that the action is more imminent. That is:\nأَنَا ذَاهِبٌ …\nʾana d͡hāhibun …\n“I will [definitely] go …”\nor\n“I’m going to go …”\nسَأَذْهَبُ …\nsaʾad͡h·habu …\n“[Soon] I will go …”\n\n\n26.4.2.3 With a direct doee\nIf a verb takes a direct doee, and we wish to use the direct doee with the verb’s doer participle when the doer participle is acting as a verb, then we may deal with it in one of three ways:\n\nThe direct doee in propped-state following the doer participle\nThe most basic method of dealing with a direct doee of a doer participle is by placing it in the propped-state right after the doer participle. Here is an example,\nقَدْ دَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ رَجُلٌ شَرِيرٌ. هُوَ قَاتِلٌ سُكَّانَهَا.\nqad dak͡hala -lmadīnata rajulun s͡harīrun. hua qātilun sukkānahā.\n“An evil man has entered the city. He is going to kill its residents.”\n\nThe direct doee in lowered-state annexed to the doer participle\nThe combination of the doer participle and following direct doee in the propped-state is often replaced with an annexation of the doer participle to the lowered-state direct doee. So, for example, instead of the above example, we can say:\nقَدْ دَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ رَجُلٌ شَرِيرٌ. هُوَ قَاتِلُ سُكَّانِهَا.\nqad dak͡hala -lmadīnata rajulun s͡harīrun. hua qātilu sukkānihā.\n“An evil man has entered the city. He is going to kill its residents.”\nNote that قَاتِلُ سُكَّانِهَا qātilu sukkānihā. can also support the non-verbal meaning of the doer participle: “killer of its residents”, i.e., he has already killed its residents in the past. So, when an annexation is used with a doer participle, we will often need surrounding context to tell us whether the verbal (resembling) meaning is intended, or the noun meaning.\nThis usage of annexing the doer participle to the lowered-state direct doee instead of employing the more basic usage of the doer participle and a following propped-state direct doee is optional, but fairly common. In fact, when the doer participle is indefinite and tanwīned, and the direct doee begins with ٱَلْ ʾal, then the annexation usage becomes predominant over the basic propped-state usage. So we will be more likely to see:\nأَنَا فَاعِلُهُ.\nʾana fāɛiluhu.\ninstead of:\nأَنَا فَاعِلٌ إِيَّاهُ.\nʾana fāɛilun ʾiyyāhu.\nfor the meaning: “I will do it.” Note again, that the latter sentence could also support the nounal meaning of the doer participle: “I am its doer.”, i.e., “the one who did it.”\nSimilarly, it will be more common to find:\nهُوَ قَاتِلُ ٱلنَّاسِ.\nhuwa qātilu -nnāsi.\ninstead of:\nهُوَ قَاتِلٌ ٱلنَّاسَ.\nhuwa qātiluni -nnāsa.\nfor the meaning: “He is going to kill the people.” Note, once again, that the former sentence also supports the meaning: “He is the people’s killer.”, i.e., “the one who killed them”, and that context would be needed to tell us which of the two meanings is intended.\nThe annexation of a doer participle to its direct doee in the lowered-state is not the kind of “proper” annexation that we have learned so far. In fact, it is called an improper annexation and we shall study it in more detail in chapter [TODO], if Allāh wills.\nQuite similar to what we learned in section (ref) for maṣdars, the direct doee can follow the doer participle in the lowered-state preceded by the preposition لِ li.\n\nThis is often optional, as an alternative to the above two methods. For example,\nهُوَ قَاتِلٌ لَهُمْ.\nhuwa qātilun lahum.\n“He will kill them.”\nUsing لِ li in this manner is also a technique to move the direct doee before the doer participle for effect, if desired. For example,\nهُوَ لَهُمْ قَاتِلٌ.\nhuwa lahum qātilun.\n“He will kill them.”\n\n\n\n\n26.4.3 The definite doer participle as a verb\n\nSo far we have seen only an indefinite doer participle being used with the meaning of an resembling verb. However, the definite doer participle, too, can give this meaning. The meaning is often in the present tense. Here are some examples:\nWith an indirect doee:\nقَدِمَ زَيْدٌ ٱلذَّاهِبُ إِلَى ٱلْجَامِعَةِ.\nqadima zayduni -d͡hd͡hāhibu ʾila -ljāmiɛati.\n“Zayd, the one who goes to the university, has arrived.”\nWith a direct doee in the propped-state:\nهَرَبْتُ مِنَ ٱلْأَسَدِ ٱلْآكِلُ ٱلْإِنْسَانَ.\nharabtu mina -lʾasadi -lʾākilu -lʾinsāna.\n“I fled from the lion, the one that eats man.”\nWith a direct doee in the lowered-state preceded by the preposition لِ li: \nسَيَنْجَحُ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلتَّارِكُ لِلَّهْوِ.\nsayanjaḥu -ṭṭālibu -ttāriku lillahwi.\n“The student, the one who leaves idle amusement, will succeed.”\n\n\n26.4.4 Plurals of the doer participle when used as a verb\nWe mentioned in section @ref(the-doer participle-as-a-noun) that doer participles when used with their nounal meaning often have broken plurals along with their sound plural. We gave the example of the doer participle قَاتِل qātil “a killerm.” with the sound plural is قَاتِلُونَ qātilūna and the broken plurals قُتَّال quttāl and قَتَلَة qatalah.\nWhen the doer participle is used as a verb, only the sound plural is permitted to be used, and the broken plurals, if any are not used. So we can only say:\nهُمْ قَاتِلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ.\nhum qātilūna -nnāsa.\nand\nهُمْ قَاتِلُو ٱلنَّاسِ.\nhum qātilu -nnāsi.\nfor\n“They will kill the people.”\nnot, for example\n\\(\\times\\) هُمْ قُتَّالٌ ٱلنَّاسَ.\n(In the second sentence, the ن of قَاتِلُونَ is ommitted because it is an annexe noun).",

    "section": "26.5 The doee participle",
    "text": "26.5 The doee participle\nThe doee participle for form 1 verbs is on the pattern مَفْعُول mafɛūl. It carries the meaning of the person or thing to whom the action of the verb has been done. For example, the doee participle for the verb قَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا “to kill (ه s.o.)” is مَقْتُول maqtūl and means “a killed person”.\n\n26.5.1 The plural of the doee participle\nThe doee participle almost always takes the sound plurals -ūn for masculine intelligent beings, and -āt otherwise. Therefore the plural of the doee participle مَقْتُول maqtūl “a killed personm.” is مَقْتُولُونَ maqtūlūna “killed personsm.”. and the plural of the doee participle مَقْتُولَة maqtūlah “a killed personf.” is مَقْتُولَات maqtūlāt “killed personsf.”.\nThere are a only a few doee participles that, as an exception, have broken plurals. The broken plural for these exceptions is than always on the pattern 2مَفَاعِيل mafāɛīl2. For example, the doee participle for the verb لَعَنَ يَلْعَنُ لَعْنًا “to curse (ه s.o.)” is مَلْعُون malɛūn “accursed” and its plural is 2مَلَاعِين malāɛīn2.\n\n\n26.5.2 Usage of the doee participle\nMuch of what has been said regarding the doer participle applies to the doee participle as well: The doee participle may be used with a verbal meaning for the resembling verb only. So if we say:\nهُوَ مَقْتُولٌ.\nhuwa maqtūl\nwith a verbal meaning, then it means “He will be killed.” And if we say it using its nounal meaning, then it means “He is the person killed.”\n\n\n\n26.5.3 The doee participles of indirect doee verbs\nConsider the verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا “to question (ه عن s.o. about s.th.)”.\nHere it is used in a sentence:\nسَأَلَ زَيْدٌ زَيْنَبَ عَنْ حَادِثَةٍ.\nsaʾala zaydun zaynaba ɛan ḥādit͡hah.\n“Zayd questioned Zaynab about an accident.”\nIn this sentence, زَيْدٌ zaydun “Zayd” is the doer. The corresponding doer participle that refers to him is سَائِل sāʾil “a questionerm.”. Next, زَيْنَبَ zaynaba “Zaynab” is the direct doee. The corresponding doee participle that refers to her is مَسْؤُولَة masʾūlah “a questioned personf.”. But how, now, do we refer to the indirect doee: حَادِثَةٍ ḥadit͡hatin “an accident”? The answer is that the doee participle referring to this indirect doee is مَسْؤُول عَنْهَا masʾūl ɛanhā “a thingf. questioned about”.\nLet’s analyze this term مَسْؤُول عَنْهَا masʾūl ɛanhā “a thing questioned about” carefully. The first word is مَسْؤُول masʾūl which shall always be singular masculine, regardless of the gender and number of the indirect doee. The second word is عَنْهَا ɛanhā “about it”. Here عَنْ ɛan is the same preposition that has been used with the verb. And هَا hā is the pronoun that refers to the indirect doee حَادِثَةٍ ḥadit͡hatin “an accident”. If the number or gender of the indirect doee were to change then this would be reflected in this pronoun.\nSo, for example, if we say,\nنَظَرَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلرِّجَالِ.\nnaḍ͡hara zaydun ʾila -rrijāli.\n“Zayd looked at the men.”\nthen, the doee participle that refers to ٱلرِّجَالِ ʾarrijāli “the men” is مَنْظُور إِلَيْهِمْ manḍ͡hūr ʾilayhim “personsm. looked at”.\nIf doee participles of indirect doees are used in sentences then it is the first word (in this case مَنْظُور manḍ͡hūrun) that changes for definiteness and state (but not for gender or number, as already discussed). Here are some examples:\nFrom the verb لَعِبَ يَلْعَبُ لَعِبًا “to play (هـ s.th.)”:\nهَـٰذِهِ ٱلْكُرىٰ هِيَ ٱلْمَلْعُوبُ بِهَا.\nhād͡hi -lkurā hiya -lmalɛūbu bihā.\n“These balls are the ones played with.”\nFrom the verb أَمَرَ يَأْمُرُ أَمْرًا “to order (ه s.o. ب to do s.th.)”:\nفَعَلَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱلْمأمُورَ بِهِنَّ.\nfaɛala -lg͡hulāmu -lmaʾmūra bihinna.\n“The boy did the [things] ordered to do.”\n(Remember that the feminine plural pronouns may be used to refer to plural non-intelligent beings, regardless of their grammatical gender, in order to indicate plurality.)\nHaving said all this, in practice, you may find that indirect doees are sometimes treated as direct doees when forming their doee participle. This is especially common when forming plurals for terms that are very common. So instead of referring to “[things] ordered to do” in the above example as ٱَلْمأمُورَ بِهِنَّ ʾalmaʾmūra bihinna, you may find the word ٱَلْمَأْمُورَاتِ ʾalmaʾmūrāti used instead.\nTODO: The doee participle for indirect doees may have some ambiguity with the doee verbal for direct doees. مسؤول عنه can also be “the person who is asked about it” where the pronoun has been substituted for a noun, for example مسؤول عن الأمر . In this case it is the word مسؤول which will be feminized and pluralized. المسؤولون عنه “the persons asked about it.”\nFor that matter ساءل عنه is also valid as “the questioner about it”.",

    "text": "26.6 Doer participles and doee participles re-used as adjectival nouns\nDoer participles and doee participles are often re-used as adjectival nouns with meanings that are directly formed from their doer participle and doee participle meanings respectively. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerb\nDoer participle/doee participle\nAdjectival noun meaning\n\n\n\n\nنَعُمَ يَنْعُمَ نُعُومَةً “to be soft”\nنَاعِم\n“soft”\n\n\nيَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَةً “to be dried up”\nيَابِس\n“dried up”\n\n\nحَضَرَ يَحْضُرُ حُضُورًا “to be present”\nحَاضِر\n“present (attending)”\n\n\nجَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ جَمْعًا “to gather (هـ s.th.)”\nجَامِع\n“comprehensive”\n\n\nلَمَعَ يَلْمَعُ لَمْعًا وَلَمَعَانًا “to be shiny”\nلَامِع\n“shiny”\n\n\nفَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا “to open (هـ s.th.)”\nمَفْتُوح\n“open”\n\n\nشَهَرَ يَشْهَرُ شَهْرًا “to make famous (ه، هـ s.o., s.th.)”\nمَشْهُور\n“famous”\n\n\n\n\n26.6.1 Genderizability of doer participles and doee participles when re-used as adjectival nouns\nWhen a doer participle or doee participle is re-used as an adjectival noun, then it generally retains its genderizability. For example,\nبَابٌ مَفَتُوحٌ\nbābun maftūḥun\n“an open door”\nand\nنَافِذَةٌ مَفَتُوحَةٌ\nnāfid͡hatun maftūḥatun\n“an open window”\nIf, however, the adjectival noun is only applicable to females, then, only a female adjectival noun is formed but, peculiarly, without the feminine marker ة. The most common example is from the verb: حَمَلَ يَحْمِلٌ حَمْلًا “to carry (هـ s.th.)”. The doer participle is حَامِل ḥāmil “a carrier”. The adjectival noun formed from the doer participle is “pregnant”, but because it is only applicable to females, it does not get the feminine marker ة. For example,\nٱَلْمَرْأَةُ حَامِلٌ.\nʾalmarʾatu ḥāmil.\n“The woman is pregnant.”\nThis does not affect the doer participle when it is not used with this adjectival noun meaning. For example,\nٱَلْمَرْأَةُ حَامِلَةُ ٱلْمَاءِ.\nʾalmarʾatu ḥāmilatu -lmāʾ.\n“The woman will carry the water.”\nor\n“The woman is the water-carrier.”\n\n\n26.6.2 Corresponding with English adjectives\nSometimes both the doer participle and the doee participle are used in Arabic with distinct meanings where we would use the same word in English. For example, the verb عَقَلَ يَعْقِلُ عَقْلًا ɛaqala yaɛqilu ɛaqlan means “to make sense (هـ of s.th.)”. Its doer participle عَاقِل ɛāqil means “one who makes sense (of something)” and may be re-used as an adjectival noun meaning “sensible” when it refers to a person who makes sense of something. For example,\nزَيْدٌ غُلَامٌ عَاقِلٌ.\nzaydun g͡hulāmun ɛāqil.\n“Zayd is a sensible boy.”\nIts doee participle مَعْقُول maɛqūl means “something which makes sense” and may be re-used as an adjectival noun meaning “sensible” when it refers to a something which makes sense. For example,\nهَـٰذَا مَنْهَجٌ مَعْقُولٌ.\nhād͡hā manhajun maɛqūl.\n“This is a sensible approach.”",

    "section": "26.7 Doer participle and doee participles re-used as common nouns",
    "text": "26.7 Doer participle and doee participles re-used as common nouns\nThe doer participle is often re-used as a common noun with a meaning that is either directly, or indirectly related to the meaning of the verb. For example, the doer participle of the verb سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا saʾala yasʾalu suʾālan is سَائِل “a questioner” with the sound plural سَائِلُونَ sāʾilūna and the broken plurals سُؤَّال suʾʾāl and سَأَلَة saʾalah.\nThe word سَائِل sāʾil “a questioner” is re-used with the meaning “a beggar”. The association in meaning is that a beggar continually asks people for money.\nThe re-use of a doer participle or doee participle as a common noun does not prevent it from continuing to be used with its doer/direct doee or verbal meaning. سَائِل sāʾil may be used to mean both “a questioner” and “a beggar”, and context will help us determine which of the meanings is intended.\nWhen a doer participle is re-used as a common noun then only the broken plural, if it exists, may be used. The sound plural is only permitted to be used if no broken plurals exist. Here are some more examples of doer participles re-used as common nouns: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerb\nDoer participle/doee participle\nPlural\nCommon noun meaning\n\n\n\n\nعَلِمَ يَعْلَمُ عِلْمًا “to know (هـ s.th.)”\nعَالِم\n2عُلَمَاء\n“a scholar”\n\n\nطَلَبَ يَطْلُبُ طَلَبًا “to seek (هـ s.th.)”\nطَالِب\nطُلَّاب، طَلَبَة\n“a student”\n\n\nلَعِبَ يَلْعَبُ لَعِبًا “to play (هـ s.th.)”\nلَاعِب\nلَاعِبُونَ\n“a player”\n\n\nجَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ جَمْعًا “to gather (هـ s.th.)”\nجَامِعَة\nجَامِعَات\n“a university”\n\n\nجَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ جَمْعًا “to gather (هـ s.th.)”\nجَامِع\n2جَوَامِع\n“a mosque (in which the Friday prayers are performed)”\n\n\nحَدَثَ يَحْدُثُ حُدُوثًا “to happen”\nحَادِثَةٌ\n2حَوَادِث\n“an accident”\n\n\nشَرِبَ يَشْرَبُ شُرْبًا “to drink (هـ s.th.)”\nشَارِب\n2شَوَارِب\n“a moustache”\n\n\nسَحَلَ يَسْحَلُ سَحْلًا “to abrade (هـ s.th.)”\nسَاحِلٌ\n2سَوَاحِل\n“a seashore”\n\n\nضَمِنَ يَضْمَنُ ضَمَانًا “to guarantee (هـ s.th.)”\nمَضْمُوxk\n2مَضَامِين\n“a content (of a letter, etc.)”\n\n\nدَخَلَ يَدْخُلُ دُخُولًا “to enter”\nدَاخِل\nnone\n“inside”\n\n\nخَرَجَ يَخْرُجُ خُرُوجًا “to exit”\nخَارِج\nnone\n“outside”\n\n\n\nThe last two دَاخِلٌ “inside” and خَارِجٌ “outside” are notable. Here, for example, is how they can be used:\nغَسَلَ ٱلْكُوبَ مِنْ دَاخِلٍ.\ng͡hasala -lkūba min dāk͡hilin.\n“He washed the tumbler from inside.”\n\n26.7.1 Genderizability of doer participle and doee participles when re-used as common nouns\nWhen a doer participle or doee participle is re-used as a common noun, then it loses its genderizability. For example, if we wish to say “The building is a university.” we will say:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ جَامِعَةٌ.\nʾalbināʾu jāmiɛah.\n“The building is a university.”\nWe cannot masculinize جَامِعَة jāmiɛah “a university” to جَامِع jāmiɛ in order to make it match the gender of بِنَاء bināʾ (masc.) “a building”. Were we to do so, then جَامِع jāmiɛ would get interpreted with either:\n\nIts doer participle meaning “a gatherer”:\n“The building is a gatherer.”\nwhich doesn’t make sense as a sentence.\nOr, with the common noun meaning of جَامِع jāmiɛ, if one happens to exist. There is such a meaning in this case: “a mosque (in which the Friday prayers are performed)”. So then we would get:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ جَامِعٌ.\nʾalbināʾu jāmiɛun.\n“The building is a mosque (in which the Friday prayers are performed).”\nOr, with the adjectival noun meaning of جَامِع jāmiɛ, if one happens to exist. There is such a meaning in this case: “comprehensive”. So then we would get:\nٱَلْبِنَاءُ جَامِعٌ.\nʾalbināʾu jāmiɛun.\n“The building is comprehensive.”\n\nNone of these give the original meaning we intended: “The building is a university.” So, in summary, once a doer participle or doee participle is re-used as a common noun, it loses its genderizability.\nHaving said this, when a doer participle is re-used as a common noun that applies to humans, both the masculine and feminine common-noun typically exist together. So for example,\nعَالِم ɛālim is re-used as the common-noun for “a (male) scholar” with the plural 2عُلَمَاء ɛulamāʾ. And\nعَالِمَة ɛālimah is re-used as the common-noun for “a (female) scholar” with the plural عَالِمَات ɛālimāt.\nIn such cases, i.e., when applicable to humans, the dictionary will generally only list, and supply the definition for the masculine common-noun. The reader is expected to know that its feminine exists and how to form it.\nThere are exceptions, however. The verb جَرَىٰ يَجْرِي جَرْيًا jarā yajrī jaryan “to run” is formed from the root جري. This is a weak root because of the letter ي in it, and we will study it in more detail later in chapter @ref(roots-with-weak-final-letter). In any case, its feminine doer participle is جَارِيَة jāriyah and is re-used for the common noun meaning “a girl”. The masculine doer participle is not re-used as a common noun for the meaning “a boy”.",

    "text": "27.2 كَانَ, its subject, and its comment\nConsider the sentence:\nٱلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.\n“The man is a teacher.”\nThis is a subject-comment sentence. ٱلرَّجُلُ is the subject in the raised-state, and مُعَلِّمٌ is the comment, also in the raised-state. Arabic does not, in this case, express any word for “is”.\nConsider now the following sentence:\n\n\nNow, as you can see, Arabic does express a word for “was”. It is the past verb كَانَ kāna. كَانَ is a hollow verb from the root كون. It’s resembling verb is يَكُونُ yakūnu. The complete table for this verb for all doer pronouns is given below:\n\n\n\nDoer pronoun\npast verb\nresembling verb\n\n\n\n\nhe\nكَانَ\nيَكُونُ\n\n\nshe\nكَانَتْ\nتَكُونُ\n\n\nyou1m\nكُنْتَ\nتَكُونُ\n\n\nyou1f\nكُنْتِ\nتَكُونِينَ\n\n\nI\nكُنْتُ\nأَكُونُ\n\n\nthey2m\nكَانَا\nيَكُونَانِ\n\n\nthey2f\nكَانَتَا\nتَكُونَانِ\n\n\nyou2\nكُنْتُمَا\nتَكُونَانِ\n\n\nthey3m\nكَانُوا\nيَكُونُونَ\n\n\nthey3f\nكُنَّ\nيَكُنَّ\n\n\nyou3m\nكُنْتُمْ\nتَكُونُونَ\n\n\nyou3f\nكُنْتُنَّ\nتَكُنَّ\n\n\nwe\nكُنَّا\nنَكُونُ\n\n\n\nLike, for other verbs, the doer of كَانَ, ٱلرَّجُلُ, is in the raised-state, and and its direct doee, مُعَلِّمًا, is in the propped-state.\nHowever, unlike most other verbs, the doer of كَانَ, ٱلرَّجُلُ, is also called its subject and its direct doee, مُعَلِّمًا, is also called its comment.\nSo a sentence with كَانَ used in this way is a subject-comment sentence. If it begins with كَانَ then it is also a verbal sentence at the same time.\nThis property also applies to the sisters of كَانَ that we will learn later in this chapter. Together, these verbs are also called deficient verbs, because, besides their doer/subject, they also need an comment to complete the meaning of the sentence. That is, without the comment, the sentence is deficient.\n“Is” subject-comment sentences can be converted to “was” subject-comment sentences using the verb كَانَ. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“is”\n“was”\n\n\n\n\nزَيْنَبُ جَائِعَةٌ.\nكَانَتْ زَيْنَبُ جَائِعَةً.\n\n\n“Zaynab is hungry.”\n“Zaynab was hungry.”\n\n\nٱَلْغُلَامُ زَيْدٌ.\nكَانَ ٱلْغُلَامُ زَيْدًا.\n\n\n“The boy is Zayd.”\n“The boy was Zayd.”\n\n\nٱَلنِّسَاءُ فِي بُيُوتِهِنَّ.\nكَانَتْ ٱلنِّسَاءُ فِي بُيُوتِهِنَّ.\n\n\n“The women are in their houses.”\n“The women were in their houses.”\n\n\nهُمْ مَسْرُورُونَ وَفَرِحُونَ.\nكَانُوا مَسْرُورِينَ وَفَرِحِينَ.\n\n\n“They3m are happy and rejoicing.”\n“They3m were happy and rejoicing.”\n\n\nأَنَا نَائِمَةٌ.\nكُنْتُ نَائِمَةً.\n\n\n“I1f am sleeping.”\n“I1f was sleeping.”\n\n\nأَنْتَ لِي أَخٌ.\nكُنْتَ لِي أَخًا.\n\n\n“You1m are a brother to me.\n“You1m were a brother to me.\n\n\n\n\n27.2.1 Sequence of كَانَ, its subject, and its comment\nIn sentence word order, the natural sequence is verb, subject, comment.\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا. \n“Zayd was standing.”Wright 2/100B\nbut we may also, for the same meaning, apply the sequence verb, comment, subject:\nكَانَ قَائِمًا زَيْدٌ. \n“Zayd was standing.”Wright 2/100B\nand also the sequence comment, verb, subject:\nقَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ. \n“Zayd was standing.”Wright 2/100B\nThis last order is common in questions and alternative sentence sentences. For example:\nأَقَائِمًا كَانَ زَيْدٌ.\n“Was Zayd standing?”\nٱُدْعُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا كَانَ أَوْ جَالِسًا!\n“Call Zayd, be he standing or sitting!”\n\nSometimes, however, this inversion is impossible because of an indistinguishable state of the two nouns.\nFor example, in order to express “My brother was my companion,” we must say:\nكَانَ أَخِي رَفِيقِي. \n“My brother was my companion.”Wright 2/100C\nThis is because, if we invert it, it would naturally mean:\nكَانَ رَفِيقِي أَخِي. \n“My companion was my brother.”Wright 2/100C\nThe following apparent sequence is also possible:\nزَيْدٌ كَانَ قَائِمًا.\n“Zayd: he was standing.”\nBut this is actually a subject-comment sentence. زَيْدٌ is the subject. And the comment is كَانَ قَائِمًا, which is itself a كَانَ subject-comment sentence in the sequence verb, subject, comment. The subject is the hidden pronoun “he” and the comment is قَائِمًا.\n\n\n27.2.2 Plurals of non-rational beings with كَانَ\nBecause كَانَ sentences are subject-comment being sentences, many of the rules that we have learned for subject-comment sentences also apply to كَانَ sentences. One such rule is that when the subject of a sentence is a plural of non-rational beings, and the comment is a adjectival noun, then the feminine singular adjectival noun is often used. (See section @ref(usage-of-plurals-of-non-intelligent-beings).) For example:\nكَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صَغِيرَةً. (typical)\n“The houses were small.”\nAlso allowed, but not as common:\nكَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صَغِيرَاتٍ.\nكَانَتِ ٱلْبُيُوتُ صِغَارًا.\nٱلثِّيرَانُ كَانَتْ ضَخْمَةً. (typical)\n“The bulls were large.”\nAlso allowed, but not as common:\nٱلثِّيرَانُ كَانَتْ ضِخَامًا.\nٱلثِّيرَانُ كُنَّ ضَخْمَاتٍ.\n\n\n27.2.3 كَانَ with a separating pronoun\nAnother rule that applies to subject-comment sentences, and that carries over to كَانَ sentences, is that when the subject and comment are both definite, then a separating pronoun, which is a detached pronoun that matches the subject, can be inserted between them. For example,\nكَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ هُمُ ٱلْفَائِزِينَ.\n“The believers were the winners.”\nThe separating pronoun هُمْ does not, in this case, serve to disambiguate the comment ٱلْفَائزِينَ “the winners”, from being a describer, as it did in sentences without كَانَ (see section @ref(subject-comment-sentences-separating-pronoun)). This is because the propped-state of ٱلْفَائزِينَ already tells us that it is the comment of كَانَ. If ٱلْفَائزِينَ were a describer of the raised-state subject ٱَلْمُوْمِنُونَ, then it too would be in the raised-state, not the propped-state. So the separating pronoun serves more, here, to emphasize the subject.\nMost of the time, separating pronouns are used in كَانَ sentences when the subject of كَانَ is itself a pronoun. Examples:\nوَكُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْوَارِثِينَ \n“And it is We who were the inheritors”سورة القصص 28:58\nكُنْتَ أَنْتَ ٱلرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ \n“You were the Observer over them”سورة المائدة 5:117\nSometimes a pronoun may appear to be a separating pronoun, but actually is not one. Consider, for example, the following sentence:\nكَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ هُمُ ٱلْفَائِزُونَ.\n“The believers were the winners.”\nNote that ٱَلْفَائِزُونَ is in the raised-state, so it is not, by itself, the comment of كَانَ. So this is, in fact, a subject-comment sentence. ٱَلْمُوْمِنُونَ is the subject of كَانَ. The comment of كَانَ is the comment هُمُ ٱلفَائِزُونَ, which is itself a subject-comment sentence with a raised-state subject (هُمْ) and a raised-state comment (ٱلْفَائزُونَ).\n\n\n27.2.4 Negating كَانَ\nLike other past verbs, the verb كَانَ may be negated by preceding it with the particle مَا. For example:\nمَا كَانَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّۭا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّۭا وَلَـٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًۭا مُّسْلِمًۭا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ \n“Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allāh]. And he was not of the polytheists.”سورة آل عمران 3:67\nA similar meaning may be obtained with the particle لَمْ followed by the clipped-state resembling verb يَكُنْ. This is dealt with in section @ref(lam-yakun) below.\n\n\n27.2.5 Gender of a pronoun subject of كان\nRemember from section @ref(gender-of-pronoun-subject) that when the subject of a sentence is a pronoun, then it may optionally either match the gender of the noun it refers to, or the the gender of the predicate. This rules carries over to كَانَ subject-comment sentences as well. For example:\nذَهَبْتُ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ. وَكَانَتْ لِي عَادَةً.\n“I went to the market in the morning. And it was a habit for me.”\nوَرَكِبُوهُمْ فَكَانَتْ هَزِيمَتَهُمْ \n“And they bore down upon them and it was their defeat.”Wright 2/298C\nNote, how, in the above examples, كَانَتْ has a ت of femininity to match the feminine gender of the comment عَادَة “habit”, and هَزِيمَتَهُمْ “their defeat”.\n\n\n27.2.6 A pronoun as the comment of كَانَ\nTODO",

    "section": "27.3 The resembling verb يَكُونُ",
    "text": "27.3 The resembling verb يَكُونُ\nThe rules related to كَانَ, its subject, and its comment, that we have given above apply also to its resembling verb يَكُونُ.\nWe will now discuss the usages of the specific states of the resembling verb.\n\n27.3.1 The raised-state resembling verb يَكُونُ\nWe have already mentioned that Arabic does not usually express any word for “is”. So when, then, is the raised-state resembling verb يَكُونُ used? There are actually a few uses of this verb. We will explain them below:\n\n27.3.1.1 يَكُونُ used for habitual “is”\nConsider the sentence, “The mother cooks the food.” The verb “cooks” implies that the action is habitually done, not necessarily that it is being done at present. If we wished to say that the action is being done at present, we might instead say, “The mother is cooking the food.” English maintains this distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs. But it does not for ther verb “is”. So if we say, “The sky is blue,” then it can mean both (i) that the sky is blue at present, or (ii) that it is habitually blue, not necessarily that it is blue at present.\nIn Arabic the situation is somewhat different. Arabic does not usually have a distinction between the present and the habitual for most verbs. So تَطْبُخُ الْأُمُّ الطَّعَامَ. may mean both (i) that the mother is cooking the food at present, or (ii) that she habitually does.\n\nBut for the verb “is”, Arabic can distinguish between the present and the habitual. So if we say السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءُ, then this can, in general, mean both (i) that the sky is blue at present, and (ii) that it is habitually blue. If we wish to emphasize the habitual meaning, we may use the resembling verb يَكُونُ, thus:\nتَكُونُ السَّمَاءُ زَرْقَاءَ.\n“The sky is [habitually] blue.”\nWhile we call this the habitual يَكُونُ, it can include a range of meanings, including continually, recurringly, regularly, typically, generally, often, sometimes, can, may, etc. Habitual يَكُونُ is negated using مَا or لَا, just like other raised-state resembling verbs.\nHere are some examples:\nقَالَ وَمَا الْبِتْعُ وَالْمِزْرُ؟ قُلْتُ شَرَابٌ يَكُونُ مِنَ الْعَسَلِ وَالْمِزْرُ يَكُونُ مِنَ الشَّعِيرِ \n“He said: ‘What is mead and beer?’ I said: ‘A drink: it is from honey, and beer: it is from barley.’” سنن النسائي :5604\n\nيَكُونُ اللِّحَافُ وِسَادَةً وَلَا تَكُونُ الْوِسَادَةُ لِحَافًا.\n“The blanket can be a pillow but the pillow cannot be a blanket.”\nمَا يَكُونُ الرَّجُلُ صَدِيقَكَ حَتّى يَصْدُقَكَ.\n“A man is not your friend until he is truthful to you.”\n\n27.3.1.1.1 قَدْ يَكُونُ for “may be”\nWhen the meaning “may be” is desired, the the resembling verb يَكُونُ may be preceded by the particle قَدْ. For example,\nقَدْ يَكُونُ الاسْتِهْزَاءُ كُفْرًا.\n“Mocking may be a disbelief.”\n\n\n\n27.3.1.2 يَكُونُ used for future “will be”\nAnother usage of the resembling verb يَكُونُ is for the future tense to mean “will be”. In this case, it is often preceded by سَ or سَوْفَ. سَ and سَوْفَ are optional and are commonly dropped, especially when the context indicates the future. Future يَكُونُ is negated by لَا. Here are some examples:\nفَقَدْ كَذَّبْتُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَكُونُ لِزَامًا \n“For you [disbelievers] have denied, so it [i.e., your denial] is going to be adherent.”سورة الفرقان 25:77\nلا يَكونُ اللَّعَّانُونَ شُفَعَاءَ وَلَا شُهَدَاءَ يَومَ القِيَامَةِ \n“The frequent cursers will be neither intercessors nor witnesses [on] the day of resurrection.”\n(يَوْمَ is in the propped-state because it is an adverb of time, see chapter @ref(adverb-of-time).)رياض الصالحين :1553\nيَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ \n“It is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed,”سورة القارعة 101:4\n\n\n\n27.3.2 The propped-state resembling verb يَكُونَ\nLike propped-state resembling verbs in general, يَكُونَ “be” expresses the meaning of purpose, wish, or expectation. It occurs after the particles أَنْ, لَنْ, لِ, كَيْ, حَتَّىٰ, and إِذَنْ. All this is consistent with what we have learned about propped-state resembling verbs in chapter @ref(propped-state-resembling-verbs). Here are some examples:\nنَزَلَ بِهِ ٱلرُّوحُ ٱلْأَمِينُ. عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنذِرِينَ \n“The Trustworthy Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] has brought it down. Upon your heart, [O Muḥammad] - that you may be of the warners -”سورة الشعراء 26:193-194\nلَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْدًۭا لِّلَّهِ وَلَا ٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ \n“Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allāh, nor would the angels near [to Him]”سورة النساء 4:172\nأَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ ٱلنَّاسَ حَتَّىٰ يَكُونُوا۟ مُؤْمِنِينَ \n“Then, [O Muḥammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?”سورة يونس 10:99\n\n\n27.3.3 The clipped-state resembling verb يَكُنْ\nThe clipped-state resembling verb يَكُنْ is used consistent with the usage of clipped-state resembling verbs in general. (See chapter @ref(clipped-state-resembling-verbs).)\nFor example:\nوَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌۭ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ \n“And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,1 and those will be the successful.”سورة آل عمران 3:104\nٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ \n“The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.”سورة آل عمران 3:60\nلَمْ يَكُنِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم سَبَّابًا وَلاَ فَحَّاشًا وَلاَ لَعَّانًا \n“The Prophet ﷺ was not one who would abuse (others) or say obscene words, or curse (others)”صحيح البخاري :6031\n\n27.3.3.1 Deletion of ن\nThe ن may (irregularly) be deleted for the clipped-state resembling verbs that don’t have a و before them. These are:\n\nيَكُنْ, becomes يَكُ\nتَكُنْ, becomes تَكُ\nنَكُنْ, becomes نَكُ\nأَكُنْ, becomes أَكُ\n\nThis may only be done when the word following the verb does not begin with a connecting hamzah ٱ. Examples:\nوَلَا تَكُ فِى ضَيْقٍۢ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ \n“and do not be in distress over what they conspire.”سورة النحل 16:127\nوَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْـًۭٔا \n“for I created you before, while you were nothing”سورة مريم 19:9\nBut we can’t say:\n\\(\\times\\) لَمْ تَكُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\nThis is because ٱلرَّجُل begins with with a connecting hamzah ٱ. So we have to say instead:\nلَمْ تَكُنِ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\n“You were not the man.”",

    "text": "27.6 Time signification of the past verb كَانَ\nThe general siginification of the past verb كَانَ is to indicate a state that existed in the past, and that has possibly ceased. For example:\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا\n“Zayd was standing.”\nThis statement is regarding Zayd’s state in the past and the implication is that he is possibly no longer standing.\nThis is the most common signification of the past verb كَانَ and the one that we have been using so far. But كَانَ is special in that it admits additional significations:\nThe second signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that, at first, had not yet begun, and which then began and remained, possibly up to the present. It has, in this sense, the meaning “became”, “has become”, or “happened”. Examples:\nأَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ \n“He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.”سورة البقرة 2:34\nاحْتَرَقَ الْخَشَبُ فَكَانَ تُرَابًا.\n“The wood burned and so became dust.”\nA third signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that will be in the future. For example:\nوَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًۭا كَانَ شَرُّهُۥ مُسْتَطِيرًۭا \n“and [they] fear a Day whose evil will be widespread.”سورة الإنسان 76:7\nA fourth signification of كَانَ is to indicate a state that always existed and will always exist.1 For example:\nوَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًۭا رَّحِيمًۢا \n“And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.”سورة الأحزاب 33:73\nوَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ ٱلزِّنَىٰٓ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ فَـٰحِشَةًۭ وَسَآءَ سَبِيلًۭا \n“And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse.1 Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.”سورة الإسراء 17:32",

    "title": "27  The verb كَانَ",
    "section": "27.7 كَانَ combined with other verbs",
    "text": "27.7 كَانَ combined with other verbs\nThe past verb كَانَ and its resembling verb يَكُونُ are combined with other verbs to express complex tenses in the past and the future, respectively. We will explain these combinations below.\n\n27.7.1 كَانَ combined with a resembling verb\nكَانَ is combined with a following resembling verb to express that the action of the verb was repeatedly or continually ocurring in the past. For example:\nكَانَ زَيْدٌ يَكْتُبُ.\n“Zayd was writing.”\nor\n“Zayd used to write.”\nor\n“Zayd would write.”\nThis sentence can be analyzed grammatically as a subject-comment sentence. The subject of كَانَ is زَيْد and it is the subject of the sentence. The comment of كَانَ is itself a sentence يَكْتُبُ “he writes”, and it is the comment of the main sentence.\nThe order of the subject and the resembling verb can be re-arranged for the same meaning thus:\nكَانَ يَكْتُبُ زَيْدٌ.\nNow, two grammatical analyses are possible:\n\nزَيْد is the doer of يَكْتُبُ, and the subject of كَانَ is a hidden pronoun of the fact.\nزَيْد is the delayed subject of كَانَ and يَكْتُبُ is the comment of كَانَ. The doer of يَكْتُبُ is a hidden pronoun.\n\nEither way, the meaning, as we have mentioned, is the same. Here are some more examples for different types of doers/subjects:\n\nكَانَ يَعْبُدُ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.\nor\nكَانَ مُشْرِكُو مَكَّةَ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ.\n“The polytheists of Makkah used to worship idols.”\nكَانَتْ تُحِبُّ الصَّدَقَةَ. \n“She used to love [to practice] charity.”صحيح البخاري :1420\nكَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ \n“their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences”\n(Sound plurals, even of rational beings, may be treated as grammatically singular feminine. See section @ref(sound-plurals-sing-fem).)سورة التغابن 64:6\nكُنْتُ أَلْعَبُ بِالْبَنَاتِ عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَكَانَ لِي صَوَاحِبُ يَلْعَبْنَ مَعِي \n“I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and I had companionsf playing with me.”صحيح البخاري :6130\nOccasionally, the particle قَدْ precedes the combination of كَانَ and the resembling verb. Example:\nقَالُوا هَذَا قَدْ كَانَ يَكْتُبُ لِمُحَمَّدٍ \n“They said, ‘This [person] used to transcribe for Muḥammad ﷺ’”صحيح مسلم :2781\nThe following resembling verb may also be an passive verb. Example:\nإِنَّ أُنَاسًا كَانُوا يُؤْخَذُونَ بِالْوَحْىِ فِي عَهْدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم \n“Indeed people were (sometimes) judged (literally: held) by the [revealing of] divine inspiration in the lifetime of the Prophet.”صحيح البخاري :2641\n\n27.7.1.1 One كَانَ suffices multiple resembling verbs\nIf the signification of an action ocurring continually in the past applies to more that one resembling verb, then it is sufficient to prefix كَانَ to only the first one. Example:\nكَانَتْ تَعْمَلُ بِيَدِهَا وَتَصَدَّقُ \n“She used to work with her hand and spend (that income) on charity.”\n(تَتَصَدَّقُ is abbreviated to تَصَدَّقُ. See section @ref(form-5-verbs-abbrev).)صحيح مسلم :2452\n\n\n27.7.1.2 Negation of كَانَ and a resembling verb\nIn order to negate the combination of كَانَ and the following resembling verb, multiple options are available. Using يَفْعَلُ as an example resembling verb, we can have:\n\nمَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ\nلَمْ يَكُنْ يَفْعَلُ\nكَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ\n\nExamples:\nمَا كَانَ أَحَدٌ يَبْدَأُ، أَوْ يَبْدُرُ، ابْنَ عُمَرَ بِالسَّلامِ \n“No one preceded or got ahead of Ibn Ɛumar with (giving) the greeting.”الأدب المفرد :982\nكَانُوا۟ لَا يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍۢ فَعَلُوهُ \n“They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did.”سورة المائدة 5:79\nلَمْ يَكُونُوا يَسْأَلُونَ عَنِ الإِسْنَادِ \n“They would not ask about the chains of narration”صحيح مسلم :introduction\nIn terms of the differences between these constructions مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ imparts more emphasis in the denial than كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ.\nThere is also difference between the options مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ and كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ in terms of when one would be used instead of the other.2. For example, if someone says to you: “I thought I saw you writing yesterday.” To reply in the negative, you would say: مَا كُنْتُ أَكْتُبُ instead of كُنْتُ لَا أَكْتُبُ to mean “I was not writing.”\nThe construction مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ is also used when one wishes to say that one never used to do something due to one’s circumstances And also to mean that one did not know how to do something in the past. For example,\nمَا كُنْتُ أَحْفَظُ شِعْرًا.\n“I used to not memorize any poetry.”\nAs for كَانَ لَا يَفْعَلُ, it connotes an intentional or purposeful lack of doing something. Whereas, with مَا كَانَ يَفْعَلُ, the lack of action may be incidental. For example, كَانَ لَا يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ “He used to not read the Qurʾān imparts that the person was intentionally not doing so. Whereas مَا كَانَ يَقْرَأُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ does not convey the intentionality of the lack of action. For example, the person may not have been reading the Qurʾān because he did not know how to.\n\n\n27.7.1.3 The combination of كَانَ with يَكُونُ\nOccasionally, كَانَ can be combined with its own resembling verb يَكُونُ This gives the meaning “was being” or “used to be”. يَكُونُ is, in this combination, often optional and may be dropped for no change in meaning. Examples:\nكَانَ يَكُونُ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ \nand\nكَانَ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ \n“He used to keep himself busy serving his family”صحيح البخاري :676صحيح البخاري :6039\nقَدْ كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي الأُمَمِ مُحَدَّثُونَ \n“There used to be in the nations inspired persons”جامع الترمذي :2398\nرِجَالٌ كَانُوا يَكُونُونَ مَعَ ٱلْمُلُوكِ \n“men that used to be with the kings”Wright 2/21C\nكَانَ يَكُونُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ \n“He used to be in the house.”Fischer 107\n\n\n27.7.1.4 Possible occurrence\nSometimes كَانَ is used with a resembling verb to express an action that could, should, or would have occurred. Examples:\nكَانَ يَكُونُ سُوءَ أَدَبٍ. \n“It would have been a misbehavior.”Fischer 108\nفَقَالَ حُذَيْفَةُ أَنْتَ كُنْتَ تَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ \n“Ḥud͡hayfah said: ‘You might have done that.’”صحيح مسلم :1788\nThis meaning can also be for the future, for example in a question:\nأَىَّ شَىْءٍ كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ \n“Which thing would you do?”سنن ابن ماجه :2606\n\n\n27.7.1.5 Omission of كَانَ\nIf one or more past verbs precedes the resembling verb or if the context indicates that the action was occurring in the past, then كَانَ can be omitted, and the resembling verb is used by itself.3 For example:\nقُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنۢبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ \n“Say,”Then why did you kill the prophets of Allāh before”\n(No كُنْتُمْ before تَقْتُلُونَ.)سورة البقرة 2:91\nوَٱتَّبَعُوا۟ مَا تَتْلُوا۟ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـٰنَ ۖ \n“And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon”\n(No كَانَتْ before تَتْلُو.)سورة البقرة 2:102\n\n\n27.7.1.6 كَانَ followed by a doer participle or doee participle instead of a resembling verb\nInstead of a resembling verb after كَانَ, its doer participle or doee participle may be used instead. And this can give the effect of a state of being rather than an action being done. For example:\nكَانَ سَاكِنًا \n“He was dwelling”Wright 2/198A\nكَانَتِ ٱلْعُصِيُّ مَرْكُوزَةً فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ. \n“The staffs were sticking in the ground.”\n(كَانَتْ تُرْكَزُ would imply that they were being stuck.)Wright 2/198A\nWhen the verbal noun refers to an action taking place in the future, the idea of futurity is transferred to a past time. For example:\nأَمْرٌ كَانَ مَفْعُولًا \n“a matter which was to be done”Wright 2/196A\n\n\n\n27.7.2 كَانَ combined with a past verb\nكَانَ is combined with a following past verb to denote an action completed prior to some past (specified or implied) point in time. Example:\n\nمَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ\n\nWright 2/5C\n“al-Ras͡hīd died at Ṭūs after (literally: and) he had set out for K͡hurāsān to combat Rāfiɛ ibn al-Layt͡h.”\nThe particle قَدْ is often used when كَانَ is combined with a past verb. قَدْ may be placed either between كَانَ and the following past verb, or before كَانَ. Examples:\nكُنْتُ قَدْ رَبَّيْتُ جَارِيَةً \n “I had brought up a girl”Wright 2/5C\nقَدْ كَانَتْ فَرَغَتْ مِنْ عَمَلِهَا.\n“She had been done with her work.”\nWhen their are multiple past verbs, and one (or more) of them occurred farther in the past than the others, it is indicated with قَدْ, the others having merely كَانَ. We re-use a previous example here and extend it:\n\nمَاتَ ٱلرَّشِيدُ بِطُوسَ وَكَانَ خَرَجَ إِلَىٰ خُرَاسَانَ لِمُحَارَبَةِ رَافِعِ بْنِ ٱللَّيْثِ. وَكَانَ رَافِعٌ هَـٰذَا قَدْ خَرَجَ وَخَلَعَ ٱلطَّاعَةَ وَتَغَلَّبَ عَلَىٰ سَمَرْقَنْدَ.\n\nWright 2/6A\n“al-Ras͡hīd died at Ṭūs after he had set out for K͡hurāsān to combat Rāfiɛ ibn al-Layt͡h. And this Rāfiɛ had already rebelled and cast off his allegiance and taken forcible posession of Samarqand.”\n(Note how قَدْ is only used before Rāfiɛ’s action of rebelling.)\n\n27.7.2.1 Negation\nThis combination may, again, be negated in multiple ways. Examples:\nلاَ يَأْتِي ابْنَ آدَمَ النَّذْرُ بِشَىْءٍ لَمْ يَكُنْ قَدْ قَدَّرْتُهُ \n“Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate,”صحيح البخاري :6609\nوَدِدْتُ أَنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ خَرَجْتُ الْعَامَ \n“I wish I had not come out (for Ḥajj) this year”سنن أبي داود :1778\nوَمَا كَانَ قَدْ أَتَاهَا بِشَيْءٍ \n“And he had not brought her anything”A report narrated in إحياء علوم الدين لأبي حامد الغزالي 3/139 without a chain\n\n\n\n27.7.3 يَكُونُ combined with a past verb\nThe resembling verb يَكُونُ is compined with a past verb (often with an interposed قَدْ) to express that the action is conceived of having been completed in the future. Examples:\nيَكُونُ قَدْ وَجَبَ عَلَيْكَ صَدَقَةٌ \n“Charity will have been incumbent upon you”مشكاة المصابيح :1793\nفَلْنَأْخُذْهُ فَنَكُونُ قَدْ أَخَْذْنَا عِوَضًا \n“Let us take him for (then) we will have taken a substitute”Fischer 108\n\n27.7.3.1 propped-state يَكُونَ combined with a past verb\nAn propped-state يَكُونَ is combined with a past verb to express being in a state of an action having occurred or that might have occurred. For example:\nخَافَ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ أَخْطَأَ \n“He feared that he could have erred.”Fischer 110\nوَيَجُوزُ أَنْ يَكُونُوا سُبِقُوا \n“And that they might have been preceded is possible”المهذب فيما وقع في القرآن من المعرب للسيوطي p. 59\nيَشْتَرِطُ فِي ٱلنَّائِبِ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ حَجَّ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ\n“It is conditional for the deputy that he be in as state of already having performed the Ḥajj for himself.”\n\n\n\n27.7.4 Verb of command كُنْ combined with a resembling verb\nOcassionally, the verb of command كُنْ is combined with a resembling verb, thus:\nكُنْ أَنْتَ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ \n“You be speaking to them!”Fischer 121",

    "text": "27.9 كَانَ with the ل of deserving\nClosely related, yet distinct from, the use of كَانَ with the ل of denial (above) is the use of كَانَ with a ل that signifies deserving, behooving, appropriateness, or possibility. This is, again, a negative كَانَ followed by the preposition لِ and a following lowered-state noun, and then أَنْ followed by an propped-state resembling verb.

    "text": "28.2 إِنَّ ʾinna\nإِنَّ ʾinna is used to begin independent sentences. It has an emphatic meaning, as if the speaker is asserting the comment about the subject. It is often translated into English as “indeed” or “verily”, but it is also often left untranslated.\nإِنَّ ʾinna is only used to begin subject-comment sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by إِنَّ ʾinna directly. (Later, in section @ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.). For example,\nإِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِنْدَ ٱللَّـٰهِ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ.\nʾinna -ddīna ɛinda -llāhi -lʾislāmu.\n“Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allāh is Islām.” (Qurʾān 3:19, trans. Saheeh International)\nإِنَّ ʾinna may be preceded by other particles like وَ “and”, فَ “so”, and ثُمَّ “then”. For example,\nٱُطْلُبِ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ. فَإِنَّ طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ. وَإِنَّ تَرْكَهُ غَفْلَةٌ. “Seek the useful knowledge. For indeed the seeking of the useful knowledge is a good deed. And indeed leaving it is a negligence.”\nThe subject of إِنَّ ʾinna may be a noun phrase, in which case, any describers or replacements of the subject are also in the propped-state. Examples:\nإِنَّ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالَ ٱلْكِرَامَ أَصْدِقَائِي.\n“Indeed these noble men are my friends.”\nإِنَّ ʾinna may have multiple subjects, each in the propped-state, separated by وَ. Example,\nإِنَّ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَٱلْمُسْلِمَاتِ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱللَّـٰهَ.\n“Indeed the Muslim men and Muslim women worship Allāh.”\nIf the comment of the first subject has been mentioned before the second subject, then the second subject may optionally be in the propped-state or the raised-state. For example:\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرًا.\nor\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرٌو.\n“Indeed Zayd is sitting and Ɛamr [as well].”\nإِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَكَ.\nor\nإِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَاكُ لَكَ.\n“Indeed this book is for me and that book is for you.”\nإِنَّ ʾinna may be used to begin sentences with an indefinite subject. For example,\nإِنَّ مَلِكًا مِنَ ٱلْهِنْدِ كَتَبَ إِلَىٰ أَحَدِ وُزَرَائِهِ.\n“Indeed a king from India wrote to one of his ministers.”\nNote that in all the above examples that إِنَّ ʾinna is only used to begin subject-comment sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by إِنَّ ʾinna directly. (Later, in section @ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.). By default, the subject of إِنَّ ʾinna must directly follow it with no intervening words or particles. The only exception is when the comment consists of a prepositional or adverbial phrase, it is then allowed to precede the subject. The subject, in any case, shall be in the propped-state. For example,\nإِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلًا.\n“Indeed, in the house, is a man.”\nإِنَّ تَحْتَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ كَنْزًا ثَمِينًا.\n“Indeed, under the tree, is a precious treasure.”\nThis reverse order is permitted even when the subject is definite. For example,\nإِنَّ مَعَكَ صَاحِبَكَ.\n“Indeed, with you, is your companion.”\nThis puts the logical accent on the subject صَاحِبَكَ “your companion”. If the subject is placed first then this puts the logical accent on the comment:\nإِنَّ صَاحِبَكَ مَعَكَ.\n“Indeed your companion is with you.”\nIf the subject contains a pronoun that refers to a noun in the comment then the comment must precede the subject. For example,\nإِنَّ فِي ٱلْمَصْنَعِ عُمَّالَهُ.\n“Indeed, in the factory, are its workers.”\nإِنَّ أَمَامَ ٱلدَّارِ حَارِسَهَا.\n“Indeed, in front of the door, is its guard.”\n\n28.2.1 Pronoun subjects\n\nThe subject of إِنَّ may be a pronoun instead of a noun. For this the attached pronouns are used. For example,\nلَا تَقْطَعْ تِلْكَ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَإِنَّهَا ظَلِيلَةٌ.\n“Don’t cut that tree, for it is shady.”\nإِنَّكُمَا صَدِيقَايَ.\n“You2 are my friends.”\nThe speaker pronouns, both singular and plural, may optionally keep or drop their ن. So for the singular speaker pronoun both إِنَّنِي ʾinnanī and إِنِّي ʾinnī may be used. And for the plural speaker pronoun both إِنَّنَا ʾinnanā and إِنَّا ʾinnā may be used. Examples:\nإِنِّي مُسْلِمٌ.\nor\nإِنَّنِي مُسْلِمٌ.\n“Indeed I am a Muslim.”\nإِنَّنَا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.\nor\nإِنَّا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.\n“Indeed we are the writers of this book.”\nTODO: Multiple pronoun subjects: إِنِّ وَ إِيَّاكَ …\nإِنَّ with the speaker pronouns are often used with doer participles to signify that the speaker intends to to the action of the verb. For example,\nإِنِّي ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\n“I’m going to the mosque.”\nWe also mentioned this point in section @ref(doer participle-for-intended-future-action).\n\n\n28.2.2 إِنَّ ʾinna with a strengthening لَ\nThe strengthening particle لَ adds extra emphasis and may optionally be used between the subject of إِنَّ and its comment. If the subject occurs first (as is the default) then لَ is connected to and placed directly before the comment. For example:\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ.\n“Indeed Zayd is definitely standing.”\nIf the comment precedes the subject, then then لَ is connected to and placed directly before the subject. For example:\nإِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ لَرَجُلًا.\n“Indeed, in the house, is definitely a man.”\nThe strengthening particle لَ is only used with إِنَّ and not for any of its other sisters (إِنَّ, أَنَّ, كَأَنَّ, لَـٰكِنَّ, لَيْتَ, and لَعَلَّ).\n\n\n28.2.3 Commonality of rules for إِنَّ and its sisters\nUnless otherwise noted, the rules we have presented above for إِنَّ, for example, the subject being in the propped-state, the order of the subject and the comment, the use of attached pronouns for the subject, etc., apply also to its other sisters.\nThe strengthening particle لَ, as mentioned above, is only used with إِنَّ and not for any of its other sisters.",

    "section": "28.3 أَنَّ ʾanna",
    "text": "28.3 أَنَّ ʾanna\nThe particle أَنَّ ʾanna can be translated as “that”. It is similar to إِنَّ in that it is asserts the comment about the subject. But أَنَّ is different from إِنَّ in that إِنَّ, its subject, and its comment together constitute a complete sentence. Whereas the أَنَّ clause (أَنَّ , its subject, and its comment together) does not constitute a complete sentence. For example, consider the expression:\nزَيْدٌ صَادِقٌ.\n“Zayd is truthful.”\nThis is a complete sentence. But if we add أَنَّ “that” to its beginning, it no longer remains a complete sentence:\nأَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ\n“that Zayd is truthful”\nWe need to additional words, external to the أَنَّ clause to complete the sentence. We will see examples of this below.\n\n28.3.1 The أَنَّ clause in place of the direct doee\n\n“I know that Zayd is truthful.”\nNote how, in the example above the أَنَّ clause (أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ) has occupied the place of the direct doee of the verb أَعْلَمُ.\nIn a similar manner, أَنَّ clauses can be placed where one would expect other noun positions, such as: a subject, an comment, a doer, and more. Here are some examples:\n\n\n28.3.2 The أَنَّ clause in place of the doer\nExample:\n\n“That you are sick has reached me.” (“It has reached me that you are sick.”)\n\n\n28.3.3 The أَنَّ clause in place of the subject\nExample (with comment before subject in sentence word order):\n\n“From his characteristeics is that he is noble.”\n\n\n28.3.4 The أَنَّ clause in place of the comment\nExample:\n\n“The truth is that he went.”\n\n\n28.3.5 أَنَّ with كَانَ\nAs you know, كَانَ’s doer is also its subject, and its direct doee is also its comment. The أَنَّ clause can occur in either the subject or the comment of كَنَ. For example, the أَنَّ clause as the comment:\n\n“The matter was that he didn’t do his obligation.”\nNow, the أَنَّ clause as the subject:\n\n“That he didn’t do his obligation was the matter.”\nNote that in the latter case, the comment precedes the subject.\n\n\n28.3.6 The أَنَّ clause in place of an lowered-state noun\nThe أَنَّ clause can occur in place of an lowered-state base noun in an annexation. Example:\n\n“The highway robbers (literally: the cutters of the way) have increased to the degree that the journey is dangerous.”\nThe أَنَّ clause can occur in place of an lowered-state noun directly following a preposition. Example:\n\n“I wondered at that Zayd is asleep.”\n\n28.3.6.1 Optionally deleting the preposition directlt before an أَنَّ clause\nIf an أَنَّ clause directly follows a preposition, it is permissible to optionally delete the preposition as long as the meaning remains clear. So the previous example can be expressed without the preposition مِنْ with the same meaning:\nعَجِبْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا نَائِمٌ.\n“I wondered at that Zayd is asleep.”\n\n\n28.3.6.2 لِأَنَّ “because”\nThe combination of the preposition لِ “for” and أَنَّ is used to mean “because”. For example,\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لِأَنَّنِي كُنْتُ جَائِعًا.\n“I ate the food because I was hungry.”\n\n\n\n28.3.7 Equivalence of the أَنَّ clause with a maṣdar\nAs a matter of grammatical theory, the أَنَّ clause, i.e. (أَنَّ itself, its subject, and its comment) is considered equivalent to a maṣdar (typically in an annexation, and possibly with a direct doee as well). It is this equivalence that allows it to thake the place of a doer, direct doee, and the other categories we have given above. For instance, consider the example:\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب.\n“I wondered at that Zayd went.”\nHere, the clause أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ “Zayd’s going”. So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:\nعَجِبْتُ مِنْ ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ.\n“I wondered at Zayd’s going.”\nSimilarly, in the example,\nمِنْ صِفَاتِهِ أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ.\n“From his characteristics is that he is generous.”\nthe clause أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase كَرَامَتِهِ “his generosity”. So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:\nكَرَامَتِهِ مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ.\n“His generosity is from his characteristics.”\nThis grammatical equivalence is more a matter of theory than of practical usefulness to us. And you have seen this grammatical equivalence before with أَنْ and propped-state resembling verbs in chanpter @ref(propped-state-resembling-verbs-verbal-noun).",

    "section": "28.8 The comment as a complete sentence and the pronoun of the fact",
    "text": "28.8 The comment as a complete sentence and the pronoun of the fact\n\n28.8.1 The comment as a complete sentence\nThere is a sub-type of subject-comment sentence where the comment is a complete sentence. Here is an example:\n\n“The tree: its branches are long.”\nIn these kinds of sentences, the subject introduces a topic, and the comment is itself a sentence which comments on the topic/subject. We have, in fact, already seen sentences like this in section @ref(past-verbs-order-of-words), when we take a verbal sentence and convert it to a subject-comment sentence. This is the example we discussed there:\nٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.\n“The man: he wrote a book.”\n\n28.8.1.1 The linker pronoun\nA subject-comment sentence, in which the comment is itself a sentence; typically requires a pronoun in the comment that links back to the subject. In the example ٱَلشَّجَرَةُفُرُوعُهَا طَوِيلَةٌ., the attached pronoun هَا “it” in فُرُوعُهَا “its tree” is the linker pronoun that links back to the subject ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ “the tree”.\nSimilarly, in the example ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا. the linker pronoun is the invisible doer pronoun “he” of the verb كَتَبَ “he wrote” that links back to the subject ٱَلرَّجُلُ “the man”.\n\n\n28.8.1.2 Subject-comment sentences with إِنَّ and its sisters\nإِنَّ and its sisters are very often used in subject-comment sentences. (With أَنَّ it is, as usual, an incomplete sentence.) Here are some examples:\nإِنَّ زَيْدًا لَهُ أَخٌ وَأُخْتٌ.\n“Indeed Zayd: he has a brother and sister.”\nٱِعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱلْعِلْمَ حُصُولُهُ يَتَطَلَّبُ جُهْدًا.\n“Know that knowledge: its obtaining requires effort.”\n\n\n28.8.1.3 Subject-comment sentences with a pronoun subject\nThe subject, in a subject-comment sentence, is frequently a pronoun. For example,\nأَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.\n“I: my name is Zayd.”\nأَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لَـٰكِنَّكَ لَمْ تَأْكُلْ.\n“I ate the food but you: you didn’t eat.”\n\n\n\n28.8.2 The pronoun of the fact\nMostly, pronouns are used in place of nouns when it is already known to whom the noun refers to. So if you say:\nأَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.\n“I: my name is Zayd.”\nthe pronoun أَنَا “I” refers to the speaker, who is known.\nThere is a special pronoun, called the pronoun of the fact that begins subject-comment sentences. This pronoun does not refer to any previously known entity, but rather refers to the comment that follows it. It is sometimes translated as “the fact is” but is often left untranslated. Here is an example:\n\n“The fact is: the cold is intense.”\nThis pronoun is usually the singular masculine pronoun (as above) but it is also sometimes the singular feminine pronoun هِيَ. It is typically used with statements of import, to which the speaker wishes to draw attention. The comment does not contain a linker pronoun because the whole comment refers back to the subject. The pronoun of the fact is frequently used with إِنَّ and its sisters. Here are some examples:\nإِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ.\n“Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.”\n(Qurʾān 23:117, trans. Saheeh International)\nSometimes, one can choose between using the pronoun of the fact and a pronoun matching the participant resulting in different emphasis. For example,\nإِنِّهُ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ\n“Indeed, the fact is: they are the doers.”\nإِنِّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ\n“Indeed, they are the doers.”",

    "text": "28.9 The lightened versions إِنْ, أَنْ, كَأَنْ, and لَـٰكِنْ\nThe particles إِنَّ, أَنَّ, كَأَنَّ, and لَـٰكِنَّ, because of the doubled نّ are considered heavy. There exist lightened versions of these particles that are: إِنْ, أَنْ, كَأَنْ, and لَـٰكِنْ. These lightened versions have similar meanings to their heavy counterparts but they have somewhat different rules. We will discuss them below. In terms of their usage إِنْ and كَأَنْ are not very commonly used except in the Qurʾān, poetry, and other rhetorical texts. أَنْ and لَـٰكِنْ are relatively more common.\n\n28.9.1 The lightened إِنْ\nThe lightened إِنْ can be used in either of the following ways:\n\nWith the same rules as the heavy إِنَّ. The subject is put in the propped-state and the use of the strengthening لَ is optional. For example,\nإِنْ زَيْدًا مُسْلِمٌ.\nor\nإِنْ زَيْدًا لَمُسْلِمٌ.\n“Indeed Zayd is a Muslim.”\nHowever, this method is not as common as the second way (below):\nThe subject is not put in the propped-state but is rather in the raised-state. However, the strengthening لَ (see section @ref(inna-strengthening-la) above), that was optional with the heavy إِنَّ, is now mandatory with the lightened إِنْ. For example,\nإِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُسْلِمٌ.\n“Indeed Zayd is a Muslim.”\n\nAnother notable difference between the lightened إِنْ and the heavy إِنَّ is that the heavy إِنَّ is only used to introduce subject-comment sentences. The lightened إِنْ, however, can be used to introduce verbal sentences, but only those that begin with the verbs: كَانَ and its sisters, كَادَ and its sisters, and ظَنَّ and its sisters. For example,\nقَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَإِنْ كَانَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَجَيِّدًا.\n“I read the book and indeed the book was good.”\n\n\n\n28.9.2 The lightened أَنْ\nAs we know, the heavy أَنَّ is an emphatic particle and is frequently used with the pronoun of the fact, thus:\nأَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.\n“I know that the fact is: the cold is intense.”\nWhen we wish not to use much emphasis, we may replace the heavy أَنَّ along with its following pronoun of the fact (أَنَّهُ/أَنَّهَا) with a lightened أَنْ, thus:\nأَعْلَمُ أَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.\n“I know that the cold is intense.”\nNote that the lightened أَنْ replaces أَنَّهُ, which is the combination of heavy أَنَّ and the pronoun of the fact هُ. So the pronoun of the fact (هُ) does not appear with the lightened أَنْ.\n\nIn the above example, the lightened أَنْ introduces a comment which is a subject-comment sentence. But the more common use of the lightened أَنْ is to introduce comments that are verbal sentences.\nWhen the comment of the lightened أَنْ is a verbal sentence, then it is preferred to separate the verb from أَنْ with one of the following:\n\nقَدْ. Example:\nأَظُنُّ أَنْ قَدْ غَرَبَتِ ٱلشَّمْسُ.\n“I think that the sun has set.”\nسَ or سَوْفَ. Example:\nأَعْلَمُ أَنْ سَيَذْهَبُ.\n“I know that he will go.”\nA negative particle like لَا, لَنْ, or لَمْ.\nأَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَا يَذْهَبُ.\n“I know that he does/will not go.”\nNote that, in writing, we have not combined the lightened أَنْ and لَا to form أَلَّا, as is done for the propped-state-verbal أَنْ (for example: أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ “that he not go”) in chapter @ref(chapter-propped-state-resembling-verbs). This distinction in spelling is not obligatory, but some authorities recommend it. In any case, they are both pronounced the same: ʾallā. \nMore examples:\nأَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَنْ يَذْهَبَ.\n“I know that he shall not go.”\nأَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَمْ يَذْهَبْ.\n“I know that he did not go.”\nNote that the لَنْ and لَمْ, even when after the lightened أَنْ, change the state of the following resembling verb to the propped-state and clipped-state respectively.\nThe conditional particle لَوْ. We will study conditional sentences in chapter @ref(conditional-sentences). TODO: add example.\n\nRigid verbs like لَيْسَ and verbs expressing supplications are exempted from needing to be separated from the lightened أَنْ. Example:\nظَنَنْتُ أَنْ لَيْسَ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدًا.\n“I thought that the cold is not intense.”\n\n28.9.2.1 Distinguishing between the lightened أَنْ and the propped-state-verbal أَنْ\nAlthough they are similar in meaning, care must be taken to distinguish between this lightened أَنْ and the propped-state-verbal أَنْ (that we learned in chapter @ref(chapter-propped-state-resembling-verbs)), The propped-state-verbal أَنْ puts the following resembling verb in the propped-state. Whereas the resembling verb directly after the lightened أَنْ remains in the raised-state. The following guidelines can help to distinguish between these two أَنْs:\n\nIf the verb before أَنْ signifies certainty then only أَنَّ and its lightened version أَنْ is used. For example,\nأَعْلَمُ أَنْ قَدْ ذَهَبَ وَأَنْ سَيَرْجِعُ.\n“I know that he has gone and that he will return.”\nIf the verb before أَنْ signifies wanting, hoping, or expecting, then the أَنْ puts the following verb in the propped-state. For example,\nأَطْمَعُ أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ.\n“I hope that he not go.”\nNote that the verb يَذْهَبَ is in the propped-state.\nIf the verb before أَنْ reflects a view of something going to occur, and signifies neither certainty nor expectation, but rather doubt or neutrality, then either of the أَنْs may be used, depending on the intended meaning. Such verbs include ظَنَّ يَظُنُّ “to think” and حَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ “to deem”. For example,\npropped-state-verbal أَنْ:\nظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعَ.\n“I thought that he should return.”\nlightened أَنْ:\nظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعُ.\n“I thought that he will return.”\nIf the verb before أَنْ does not reflect a view of something going to occur then the أَنْ is typically the propped-state-verbal أَنْ. For example,\nسَرَّنِي أَنْ تَنْجَحَ\n“That you succeed [will have] gladdened me.”\nRemember from chapter @ref(chapter-propped-state-resembling-verbs)), that the propped-state-verbal أَنْ can occur with past verbs as well. Example:\nسَرَّنِي أَنْ نَجَحْتَ\n“That you have succeeded [has] gladdened me.”\n\n\n\n\n28.9.3 The lightened كَأَنْ\nThe lightened كَأَنْ is similar to the lightened أَنْ in that it introduces a subject-comment sentence and the subject is usually a deleted pronoun of the fact. For example,\nكَأَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ ذَهَبَ.\n“[It is] as if the cold has gone.”\nAlso similar to the lightened أَنْ, the lightened كَأَنْ may introduce a verbal sentence but it must be separated from كَأَنْ by either قَدْ or لَمْ. For example,\nذَهَبَ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَسْمَعْ.\n“He went as if he did not hear.”\n\n\n28.9.4 The lightened لَـٰكِنْ\nThe lightened لَـٰكِنْ has the same meaning as the heavy لَـٰكِنَّ but it has no grammatical effect on the word or sentence after it. It may introduce either subject-comment or verbal sentences. For example,\nنَجَحَ زَيْدٌ لَـٰكِنْ صَدِيقُهُ لَمْ يَنْجَحْ.\n“Zayd succeeded but his friend did not succeed.”",

    "text": "29.1 Introduction\nConsider the sentence:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\n“I saw the man.”\nIf the listener (or reader) can identify the individual referred to by the noun “the man” (maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker), then there is no problem with this sentence. But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring. This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.\nOne way is to use an adjectival noun to describe the noun. For example:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.\n“I saw the tall man.”\nAnother way is to use a pointing noun, thus:\nرَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.\n“I saw that man.”\nBut sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. In this case, Arabic uses what is called a connected noun and a connecting sentence.  This example should help you understand what we mean:\nIn the above sentence, the connected noun is ٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī. It is applied to singular masculine nouns, like ٱلرَّجُل.  By itself it may be translated as “the one1m that/which/who/whom”.  It is called a connected noun because it is directly followed by, i.e. connected to, a connecting sentence. The connecting sentence contains necessary information for the listener to correctly identify the individual that the connected noun refers to. The connecting sentence in the above example is the sentence لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ “I met him yesterday.”\nNote by the way, that we did not translate the pronoun “him” in our original translation (above). This is because it would sound unnatural in English to say: “I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met him yesterday.” But this pronoun is an essential part of the Arabic connecting sentence and is called the refer-back pronoun. We will deal with it in section @ref(refer-back-pronoun) later in this chapter.\nThere are two types of connected nouns:\nWe will study both these types separately within this chapter.",

    "section": "29.2 The specific connected nouns",
    "text": "29.2 The specific connected nouns\nThe specific connected nouns have a significance which is restricted to a specific individual or category of individuals, and its connecting sentence should contain sufficient information to identify that specific individual.\nThe specific connected nouns is a group of nouns where each noun is applied to a gender and number of individuals. They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconnected noun\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī\nSingular masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَلَّتِي ʾallatī\nSingular feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Also used for plural non-intelligent beings of both genders. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّذَانِ ʾallad͡hānī\nDual masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: ٱَللَّذَيْنِ ʾallad͡hayni in the propped-state and lowered-state. Two ل’s in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّتَانِ ʾallatānī\nDual feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: ٱَللَّتَيْنِ ʾallatayni in the propped-state and lowered-state. Two ل’s in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَلَّذِينَ ʾallad͡hīna\nPlural masculine. For both intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one ل in its spelling.\n\n\nٱَللَّاتِي ʾallātī\nFor plural feminine intelligent beings. Also used for non-intelligent beings of both genders but ٱَلَّتِي is more common there. Rigid. Two ل’s in its spelling. Has the following variants: ٱَللَّاتِ ʾallāti, ٱَللَّائِي ʾallāʾī, ٱَللَّوَاتِي ʾallawātī\n\n\n\n\n29.2.1 Grammatical position of the specific connected noun\nConsider again the same example:\nرَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.\n“I saw the [specific] man whom I met yesterday.”\nIn this example, the connected noun ٱَلَّذِي ʾallad͡hī is a describer (in the propped-state) to the described noun  ٱلرَّجُلَ. Because ٱَلَّذِي is a rigid noun, it will appear the same in all states without any change to its ending.\nAs a describer, the connected noun may also come as the last in a series of describers, and can also be combined with a pointing noun. For example:\nرَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.\n“I saw that [specific] tall man whom I met yesterday.”\nBut connected nouns need not only occur as describers.  They may occur in various grammatical positions. Here are some examples: \nAs a subject:\nوَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنْفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّـٰهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ \n“And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allāh - give them tidings of a painful punishment.”سورة التوبة 9:34\nAs an comment:\nخِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَكُمْ \n“The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you”صحيح مسلم :1855\nهُنَّ اللَّوَاتِي عَلَى الْمِنْبَرِ \n“They are the ones which (are) on the pulpit.”سنن الدارمي :36\nAs a doer:\nقَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.\n“The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us.”\nAs a direct doee:\nرَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ \n“Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men”سورة فصلت 41:29\nFollowing a preposition:\nأَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ \n“Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township”سورة البقرة 2:259\nAs a base noun in an annexation:\nقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا \n“Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]”سورة المجادلة 58:1",

    "section": "29.3 The refer-back pronoun",
    "text": "29.3 The refer-back pronoun\nThe connecting sentence is directly follows the connected noun. As we mentioned in the introduction, the connecting sentence provides clarifying information for the listener (or reader) to identify the individual referred to by the connected noun.\n\nIn the connecting sentence is a pronoun that refers back to the connected noun. This pronoun is called the refer-back pronoun. and it is an essential (though not always apparent) part of the connecting sentence.\nLet us identify some of the refer-back pronouns in the examples we have given.\nوَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ\n“And those who hoard gold and silver”\nrefer-back pronoun: the plural masculine doer pronoun و in يَكْنِزُونَ\nخِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ\n“The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you”\nrefer-back pronoun: the plural masculine direct doee attached pronoun هُمْ in تُحِبُّونَهُمْ\nقَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.\n“The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us.”\nrefer-back pronoun: the singular masculine direct doee attached pronoun هُ in قُلْتُمُوهُ\nرَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ\n“Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men”\nrefer-back pronoun: the dual masculine doer pronoun ا in أَضَلَّانَا\nأَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ\n“Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township”\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular masculine doer pronoun “he” in مَرَّ\nقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا\n“Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]”\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular feminine doer pronoun “she” in تُجَادِلُكَ\n\n29.3.1 Matching the refer-back pronoun with the connected noun\nThe refer-back pronoun matches the specific connected noun in gender and number. And the refer-back pronoun is generally an absent-person pronoun (هُ, هَا, هُوَ, هُمْ, etc.). In the example وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ “And those who hoard gold and silver,” the refer-back pronoun is the plural masculine absent-person doer pronoun و “they” in يَكْنِزُونَ “they hoard”. And it matches the plural masculine connected noun ٱلَّذِينَ.\nHowever, there is an exception to the refer-back pronoun being an absent-person pronoun. And that is when the connected noun refers to the speaker or the addressed person, like أَنَا ٱلَّذِي, or أَنْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ, etc. In these cases, the refer-back pronoun may optionally:\n\neither be an absent-person pronoun to match the connected noun (as usual),\nor match the pronoun for the speaker or addressed person (as the case may be)\n\nThe latter is generally more common but both options are permissible. For example:\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرْتُ.\nrefer-back pronoun: the singular masculine doer pronoun for the speaker تُ in حَضَرْتُ\nor\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرَ.\nrefer-back pronoun: the implied singular masculine doer pronoun for the absent person “he” in حَضَرَ\n“I am the one (who) was present.”\nHere are some examples from Classical Arabic:\nأَنَا ٱلَّذِي سَمَّتْنِ أُمِّي حَيْدَرَهْ \n“I am the one whom my mother named Ḥaydarah”\n(The refer-back pronoun is the speaker person’s direct doee pronoun in سَمَّتْنِ, which is an abbreviation of سَمَّتْنِي “she named me”.)Wright 2/324B\nفَقَالَ مُوسَى يَا آدَمُ أَنْتَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكَ اللَّهُ بِيَدِهِ \n“Mūsā said: O Ādam, you are the one whom Allāh created with His Hand”\n(The refer-back pronoun is the addressed person’s direct doee pronoun كَ in خَلَقَكَ.)جامع الترمذي :2134\nThere is one circumstance where matching the refer-back pronoun to the (absent person) connected noun is mandated. And that is when the connected noun is the called-out person using the particle أَيُّهَا or أَيَّتُهَا. For example,\nيَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا\n“O you who have believed”\nnot\n\\(\\times\\) يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنْتُمْ\nSimilarly,\nيَاأَيُّهَا الَّذِي نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ \n“O you upon whom the message has been sent down”سورة الحجر 15:6",

    "section": "29.4 The general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا",
    "text": "29.4 The general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا\nThe general connected nouns are unrestricted in significance, and may be applied to any individual who fits the criteria given in the connecting sentence. The most commonly general connected nouns are:\n\nمَنْ man. Typically used for intelligent beings and translated as “who”.\nمَا mā. Typically used for non-intelligent beings and translated as “what”.\nأَيّ ʾayy. Used for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Translated as “which”, “whichever” or “any”.\n\nThere are also a couple of rarely or dialectally used general connected nouns that we will not cover. These are  ذُو d͡hū, and ذَا d͡hā.\nIn this section we will deal with مَنْ and مَا. We will deal with أَيّ separately in section (give ref) later in this chapter.\nUnlike the specific connected nouns (ٱَلَّذِي, etc.), the general connected nouns do not vary for number and gender.\nFor example:\nأُحِبُّّ مَنْ يَعْدِلُ\n“I love [him] who is just.”\nأُحِبُّّ مَنْ يَعْدِلُونَ\n“I love [them] who are just.”\nٱِصْنَعْ مَا بَدَا لَكَ.\n“Do what seems (good) to you.”\nمَرَرْتُ بِمَا يُعْجِبُكَ.\n“I passed by what will please you.”\n\n29.4.1 مَنْ and مَا after prepositions\nWhen مَنْ and مَا are directly preceded by the prepositions مِنْ and عَنْ, these prepositions lose their ن and are joined to the following noun with the noun’s م doubled. For example: مَمَّنْ mimman, مَمَّا mimmā, عَمَّنْ ɛamman, عَمَّا ɛammā.\nThe preposition فِي is also often (though not always) optionally attached to these connected nouns, thus: فِيمَنْ fīman, فِيمَا fīmā.\nThe remaining prepositions follow the normal rules: عَلَى مَا, كَمَنْ, etc. But we will see, if Allāh wills, in chapter @ref(questions), that مَا and مَنْ are also used as question nouns, in which case the rules of joining prepositions to them will differ.\n\n\n29.4.2 The refer-back pronoun for the general connected nouns\nThe general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا are themselves singular masculine in number and gender. However, they can be used to signify persons or things of any number and gender.\nTheir refer-back pronouns can then, optionally:\n\nEither match the gender and number of the persons or things meant by the connected noun. For example:\nوَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ [سورة يونس 10:42]\n“And among them are those who listen to you”\nقَدْ خَابَتْ مَنْ فَعَلَتْ ذَلِكَ مِنْهُنَّ وَخَسِرَتْ [جامع الترمذي :3318]\n“She has thwarted herself, whoever did that from them3f, and lost.”\nNote also how, in this example how, in addition to the feminine refer-back doer pronouns in فَعَلَتْ and خَسِرَتْ, the feminine gender of the person signified by مَنْ has also caused the تْ of femininity to be added to the verb خَابَ (of which مَنْ is the doer noun).\nجَمَعْتُ مِنَ ٱلْوَرَقِ مَا سَقَطْنَ.\n“I gathered what fell from the leaves.”\nصَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا يَتَيَسَّرْنَ.\nor\nصَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا تَتَيَسَّرُ.\n“Pray from the units (of prayer) what is easy.”\nOr be singular masculine to match the connected noun itself. This is generally more common for مَا. For example:\nوَمِنْهُم مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ [سورة يونس 10:40]\n“And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe in it.”\nجَمَعْتُ مِنَ ٱلْوَرَقِ مَا سَقَطَ. “I gathered what fell from the leaves.”\nصَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا يَتَيَسَّرُ.\n“Pray from the units (of prayer) what is easy.”\nلَمْ أَجِدْ مَا أَعْتَذِرُ بِهِ [مساوئ الأخلاق للخرائطي:171]\n“I did not find what I (could) make an excuse for with”.\n\nBoth options can be utilized together as well. For example:\nبَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌۭ فَلَهُۥٓ أَجْرُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ \n“Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Islām to Allāh while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.”سورة البقرة 2:112\nفَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ \n“whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.”سورة البقرة 2:38\n\n\n\n29.4.3 Applicability of مَا and مَنْ to intelligent and non-intelligent beings\nAs we mentioned earlier, مَنْ is typically used to refer to intelligent beings. And مَا is typically used to refer to non-intelligent beings. However, there are some circumstances in which these roles can differ.\nمَنْ may be used for non-intelligent beings when a non-intelligent being is compared with an intelligent being. For example,\n\nوَاللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِّن مَّاءٍ ۖ فَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ أَرْبَعٍ ۚ\n\nسورة النور 24:45\n\n“Allāh has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four.”\nمَنْ may also be used for non-intelligent beings when attributes usually applicable to intelligent beings are applied to a non-intelligent being. For example:\nأَسِرْبَ الْقَطَا، هَلْ مَنْ يُعِيرُ جَنَاحَه * لَعَلِّي إِلَىٰ مَنْ قَدْ هَوِيتُ أَطِيرُ \nO flock of birds, is there who will lend his wing\nthat perhaps I may fly to whom I love\nأَ: “O”, سِرْب: “flock”, قَطَا: a species of bird, هَلْ: “is there?”, يُعِيرُ: “lend”, جَنَاح: “wing”, لَعَلِّي: “Perhaps I”, هَوِيتُ: “I love”, أَطِيرُ: “I fly”.Wright 2/314D\nمَنْ may also be used for non-intelligent beings when there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings, and the intelligent beings are given preference. For example:\nوَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ \n“And to Allāh prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth”سورة الرعد 13:15\nSimilarly, مَا may, in some circumstances, be used for intelligent beings. This may be when there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings, and the non-intelligent beings are given preference because of their larger number. For example:\nيُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ \n“Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allāh”سورة الجمعة 62:1\nمَا may also be used for intelligent beings when the person being referred to is vague to the speaker. For example:\nرَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا \n“My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service]”سورة آل عمران 3:35\nمَا may also be used for intelligent beings when the characteristics of an intelligent being are highlighted when referring to them. For example:\nفَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ \n“then marry those that please you of [other] women”سورة النساء 4:3\n\n\n\n29.4.4 Grammatical position of the general connected nouns\nThe general connected noun may occur in various grammatical positions. Here are some examples:\nAs a subject:\nما عِنْدَكُمْ يَنْفَدُ \n“Whatever you have will end”سورة النحل 16:96\nAs an comment:\nمَالُكَ مَا قَدَّمْتَ، وَمَالُ وَارِثِكَ مَا أَخَّرْتَ \n“Your wealth is what you have sent forward, and the wealth of your inheritors is what you have left behind.”الأدب المفرد :153\nAs a doer:\nفَعَلَهُ مَنْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنِّي \n“it was done by one who was better than I”صحيح البخاري :668\nAs a direct doee:\nاعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ \n“Do whatever you will”سورة فصلت 41:40\nFollowing a preposition:\nوَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ \n“and make me independent from (all) who are besides You”جامع الترمذي :3563\nAs a base noun in an annexation:\n\nفَذَلِكَ مَثَلُ مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي \n“So that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me”صحيح مسلم :2283\nمَا تَرَىٰ رَأْيَ مَا نَرَىٰ. \n“You do not think what we think.”\n(literally: “You do not opine the opinion of what we opine.”)Fischer 218\nأَمْرَ مَا تَحْذَرُ \n“the matter of which you are wary”Fischer 218\nUnlike the specific connected nouns (ٱَلَّذِي, etc), the general connected nouns do not occur as describers. So while we can say:\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\n“I passed by the man who was good to me.”\nwe cannot say:\n\\(\\times\\) مَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\nWe will have to say instead:\nمَرَرْتُ بِمَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.\nThe general connected noun can, however, occur as a replacement. For example,\nوالمسلمون مَن تبع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كثير \n“And the Muslims, who follow the Messenger of Allāh, are many”Fischer §421.2. Originally, from السيرة النبوية لابن هشام.\n\n\n29.4.5 Use with the preposition مِنْ\nThe preposition مِنْ is frequently used with the general connected nouns to restrict the applicability of the connected noun to a group or type. This مِنْ may come either before the connected noun, or after its connecting sentence. For example:\n\nفَأَعْطَانِي مَا كَانَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْ خُبْزٍ. \n“Then he gave me what he had of bread.”Fischer 218\nمَنْ دَخَلَ ٱلشَّأْمَ مِنَ ٱلْعَرَبِ \n“Those Arabs who entered Syria”\n(literally: “Who entered Syria from the Arabs”)Fischer 218\nفَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ \n“then marry those that please you of [other] women”سورة النساء 4:3\nاللَّهُمَّ اقْسِمْ لَنَا مِنْ خَشْيَتِكَ مَا يَحُولُ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ مَعَاصِيكَ \nO Allāh, apportion for us, from the fear of You, (that) what shall come between us and disobedience of You\n(The connected noun مَا is the direct doee of the verb of command اقْسِمْ.)جامع الترمذي :3502\n\n\n29.4.6 Use with a repeated word to express vagueness or uncertainty\nThe general connected nouns مَنْ and مَا are used with a word that is repeated to express a vague or uncertain quantity or quality. For example:\nهُمْ مَا هُمْ \n“They are what they are.”Fischer 218\nنَزَلَ مَنْ نَزَلَ مِنْهُمْ \n“Some of them came down.”\n(literally: Came down who came down from them.”)Fischer 218\nجَمَعْتُ مَا جَمَعْتُ \n“I gathered what I gathered.”Fischer 218",

    "section": "29.5 Deleting the refer-back pronoun",
    "text": "29.5 Deleting the refer-back pronoun\nThe refer-back pronoun may be deleted (and its meaning is then implicit) if some conditions are satisfied. Some conditions are specific to the state of the refer-back pronoun. These are:\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is the subject of a subject-comment sentence, then it may be deleted, and its meaning will be implied. When deleting the refer-back pronoun in this case, it is preferred that the connecting sentence not be too short. \nFor example:\nانْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [صحيح مسلم :2963c] 1\n“Look at who is lower than you.”\n(instead of انْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ هُوَ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ.)\nوَلَهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ [سورة الأنبياء 21:19]\n“To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth.”\n(instead of مَنْ هُوَ فِي ٱلسَّمَوَاتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ)\nمَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا [Wright 2/322D]\nI am not the one who says anything to you.\n(instead of مَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا)\nIf the connecting sentence is very short, the deleting the refer-back pronoun subject is permissible, though rare. For example:\n\nلَا يَنْطِقُ بِمَا سَفَهٌ [Wright 2/322D]\n“He does not speak what is foolish.”\n(instead of بِمَا هُوَ سَفَهٌ)\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is an attached pronoun for the direct doee it is permissible to delete it. For example:\nهَـٰذَا مَا كَنَزْتُمْ لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ [سورة التوبة 9:35]\n“This is what you hoarded for yourselves”\n(instead of مَا كَنَزْتُمُوهُ)\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is in the lowered-state, it is permissible to delete it:\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is the base noun in an annexation whose annexe noun is a doer participle or the direct doee implying a present or future meaning. For example:\nفَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضٍ [سورة طه 20:72]\n“So decree whatever you are to decree.”\n(instead of فَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضِيهِ)\n\n\n\nWhen the refer-back pronoun is attached to a preposition or adverb, and the same preposition or adverb has already been used (with the same meaning) with the connecting noun or its described noun. The preposition/adverb is deleted along with its attached pronoun. For example:\n\nأَنَا عِنْدَ مَنْ أَنْتَ. [Wright 2/323C]\n“I am at his [house] at whose you (are).”\n(instead of مَنْ أَنْتَ عِنْدَهُ)\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ سُلَيْمَانُ. [Wright 2/323D]\n“I passed by the (same) one that Sulaymān did.”\n(instead of مَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ بِهِ سُلَيْمَانُ.)\n\n\nIn addition to the above conditions that are specific to the state of the refer-back pronoun, a further, general, condition should be satisfied, which is: that the omission of the refer-back pronoun be obvious to the listener, and the listener can re-construct the original meaning by restoring the refer-back pronoun to get the intended meaning.\nIf the refer-back pronoun is deleted, and the remaining connecting sentence (with the refer-back pronoun deleted) is valid as a connecting sentence on its own right, then it will give a different meaning (even if slightly) from the original. And the listener will not know that the refer-back pronoun has been deleted. In this case, it is not permitted to delete the refer-back pronoun. Here is an example that should explain what we mean:\nConsider the sentence:\nجاء الذي ضربته في داره. \n“The one whom I beat (him) in his house, came.شرح ابن عقيل على الألفية 1/168\nThe connecting sentence is ضربته في داره. “I beat him in his house.” and the refer-back pronoun is the propped-state direct doee pronoun ه “him”. If we delete this pronoun, the sentence becomes\nجاء الذي ضربت في داره.\n“The one who I beat in his house, came.\nNow the meaning of the sentence is markedly different. The connecting sentence ضربت فِي دَارِهِ is valid on its own right but it gives a different meaning from the original. It does not specify that I beat him in his house, just that I beat in his house, possibly others. Because the omission of the refer-back pronoun is not obvious, the sentence now does not siginify the original intent. And so deleting the refer-back pronoun in this case is not permitted.",

    "text": "29.6 The general connected noun أَيّ\nأَيّ ʾayy “which/whichever” is a general connected noun similar to مَا “what” and مَنْ “who”. But it differs from مَا and مَنْ in a few aspects:\nFirstly, أيّ is (generally) fully flexible. So it will display its state as a vowel mark on its final letter. Whereas مَا and مَنْ, as we know, are rigid.\nSecondly, أيّ can be, and, in fact, properly is, the annexe noun in an annexation. Whereas مَا and مَنْ cannot be annexe nouns. For example,\nيُعْجِبُنِي أَيُّ ٱلتَّلَامِذَةِ يَجْتَهِدُ.\n“Whichever of the students strives, pleases me.”\n(أيّ is in the raised-state)\n\nفَأْوِ إِلَى أَيِّهِمْ يَحْمِيكَ.\n“So take shelter with whichever of them protects you.”\n(أيّ is in the lowered-state)\nAlso, أيّ is used indiscriminately for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. For example,\nأَحْمِلُ أَيَّ ٱلْحَقِيبَتَيْنِ هِيَ ٱلْأَثْقَلُ\n“I shall carry whichever of the two bags is the heavier.”\n(أيّ is in the propped-state)\nNote how, in the above examples, the final vowel mark on أيّ varies, depending on its state due to its being a flexible noun.\nأَيّ, like مَا and مَنْ, is itself a singular masculine noun. And, like مَا and مَنْ, أَيّ can be used, unchanged, for both genders. The previous example used أَيّ with حَقِيبَة which is a feminine noun. But a feminine version أَيَّة does exist and can be used with feminine base nouns. It is, however, only commonly used if its base noun is a feminine pronoun. For example,\nصَادِقِي أَيَّتَهُنَّ تَنْصَحُكِ.\n“Befriend whichever of them3,f is sincere to you1,f.”\nBy the way, أَيّ ʾayy (like مَا and مَنْ) is also a question noun and we will discuss its properties in more detail in section …\n\n29.6.1 The connected noun أَيّ without a base noun\nأيّ can sometimes occur without a base noun. Technically, it will then be indefinite, and thus tanwīned. However, it will carry the meaning of an implied annexation. For example,\nسَأُقَاتِلُ أَيًّا يُقَاوِمُنِي.\n“I will fight whichever [of them, the enemies, etc.] resists me.”\n\n\n29.6.2 The connected noun أَيّ with a deleted refer-back pronoun\nConsistent with what we have already learned for the other connected nouns, the refer-back pronoun may be deleted in connected sentences for the connected noun أيّ.\nFor example,\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\n(instead of أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ.)\n\n\n29.6.3 Circumstance for the rigidity of أَيّ\nAs mentioned, أَيّ is generally fully flexible. However, there is one circumstance in which it may optionally be a rigid noun with the final vowel mark ◌ُ thus: أَيُّ. This is when both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nأَيّ is an annexe noun.\nThe refer-back pronoun to أَيّ is the subject of the connecting sentence and it is deleted.\n\nFor example,\nأَجْزِي أَيُّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\nSince this rigidity is optional, أَيّ may, in this case, retain its full-flexibility:\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.\n“I will reward whichever of them is truthful.”\nBut if both the conditions above are not satisfied then أَيّ shall remain fully-flexible. For example,\nأَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ.\nأَجْزِي أَيًّا هُوَ صَادِقٌ.\nأَجْزِي أَيًّا صَادِقٌ. 2",

However, the connecting sentence may be separated from the connected noun by one of the following:\n\nAn oath. For example:\nجَاءَ ٱلَّذِي وَٱللَّـٰه قَهَرَ ٱلْأَعْدَاءَ.\n“The one who - by Allāh - overpowered the enemies has come.”\nA sentence calling out to someone.

    "section": "29.9 Sentences without connected nouns",
    "text": "29.9 Sentences without connected nouns\nThere are some sentences where we might expect a connected noun but which are always, or often (as the case may be), expressed in Arabic without a connected noun. These sentences are of different types:\n\n29.9.1 Sentences with indefinite nouns needing a qualifying sentence\nWhen an indefinite noun needs a qualifying sentence, it is natural in English to insert “that”, “which”, “who”, etc. between the noun and the following sentence. For example, “I passed by a man who was sleeping.”\nIn Arabic, however, we will not use any connected noun in such sentences. This is because the connected nouns are considered definite nouns. And therefore they may not be a describer to an indefinite noun. So while we can say:\nمَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.\n“I passed by the man who is sleeping.”\nwe cannot say\n\\(\\times\\) مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.\nInstead, we put the qualifying sentence directly after the indefinite noun. The qualifying sentence will then not be a connecting sentence, but will itself be the describer to the described noun:\nمَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَنَامُ.\n“I passed by a man (who) is sleeping.”\nHere is another example:\n\nجَلَسْتُ فِي مَجْلِسٍ قَدْ رُشَّ بِمَاءِ ٱلْوَرْدِ.\n“I sat in a sitting (that) had been sprinkled with rose-water.”\nA connected noun can, however, follow an indefinite noun, if we intend to start a separate sentence with it, or if it is a replacement (see chapter @ref(the-replacement)). For example.\nوَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ \n“Resurrect him to a praiseworthy station, the one that you promised him”صحيح البخاري :614\nوَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ\nالَّذِي جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ \n“Woe to every scorner and mocker\nWho collects wealth and [continuously] counts it.”سورة الهمزة 104:1-2\n\n\n29.9.2 Sentences containing a noun with generic definiteness\nSometimes the definite article ٱَلْ does not determine a particular individual, but makes a noun definite only in a generic way. In this case a qualifying sentence may directly follow it without any intermediate connected noun used as a describer.3 Because there is no connected noun, the qualifying sentence is, again, not analyzed as a connecting sentence. For example:\nكَمَثَلِ الْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا \n“like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]”\n(Note how the translator has translated ٱلْحِمَار as “a donkey” because in English an indefinite noun is often used to indicate a generic type.)سورة الجمعة 62:5\nأَنْتَ ٱلْوَزِيرُ لَا يُعْصَىٰ \n“You are the (sort of) vizier (who) is not disobeyed.”Fischer 219\nهُمُ ٱلْفَوَارِسُ يَحْمُونَ ٱلنِّسَاءَ. \n“They are the (kind of) horsemen (who) protect the women.”Fischer 219\n\n\n29.9.3 Sentences with prepositional or adverbial phrases\nIf a sentence has a definite noun which is to be qualified by a prepositional or adverbial phrase, then in many cases, that phrase may directly follow the definite noun without any intermediate connected noun used a describer. But using a connected noun is also permissible if one wishes to emphasize that the specificity of the noun. When there is no connected noun, the prepositional or adverbial phrase is not analyzed as a connecting sentence, but is considered attached to an implied verb that has the idea of “being”, like “is”, “are”, etc. When there is a connected noun, then it is analyzed as a connecting sentence, as usual. For example:\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\n“I walked in the garden next to the mosque.”\nor\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\nor\nسِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي هِيَ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.\n“I walked in the [specific] garden that [is] next to the mosque.”",

    "section": "30.2 مَا and مَنْ",
    "text": "30.2 مَا and مَنْ\n\n30.2.1 Position of question words in the beginning of the sentence\nAll question words typically occur in the beginning of the question sentence. (Particles like وَ, فَ, etc. are allowed to precede them.) For example,\nمَنْ أَنْتَ؟ \n“Who are you?”Wright 2/311D\nوَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ؟ \n“And what is that in your right hand?”سورة طه 20:17\nIn both the above examples, the question nouns مَا and مَنْ are in the raised-state as the subject of their respective question sentences.\nWhen the question is asking about the direct doee of a verb, then too is the question noun placed in the beginning of the sentence. For example,\nمَا تَقُولُ؟ \n“What do you say?”Wright 2/312A\nمَنْ قَتَلْتَ؟ \n“Whom did you kill?”Wright 2/311D\nمَا فَرَضَ رَبُّكَ عَلَىٰ أُمَّتِكَ؟ \n“What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah?”صحيح مسلم :162a\nIn the above three examples, the question nouns مَا and مَنْ are analyzed as the propped-state direct doee of the verb following it.\nThe question nouns are exempted from being placed in the beginning of the question noun when they are in the lowered-state: either following a preposition, or as the base noun in an annexation. For example,\nلِمَنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقَصْرُ؟ \n“Whose is this palace?”جامع الترمذي :3688\nبِنْتُ مَنْ أَنْتِ؟ \n“Whose daughter are you?”Wright 2/311D\n\n\n30.2.2 مَا shortened to مَ in the lowered-state\nWhen the question noun مَا mā is in the lowered-state it is typically shortened to مَ ma. Example:\nبِمَ يَرْجِعُ؟ \n“With what does he return?”سنن ابن ماجه :4108\nThis shortened مَ is also usually joined to the preposition before it, even for prepositions constituting more than one letter (which don’t typically join to the word directly following it). So we get:\n\nبِمَ for بِمَا\nلِمَ for لِمَا\nفِيمَ for فِي مَا\nإِلَامَ for إِلَىٰ مَا\nعَلَامَ for عَلَىٰ مَا\nحَتَّامَ for حَتَّىٰ مَا\nمِمَّ for مِمَّا (مِنْ مَا)\nعَمَّ for عَمَّا (عَنْ مَا)\n\nWhen pausing on this shortened مَ, a هْ is appended to it to preserve the sound of the fat·ḥah. For example:\nلِمَهْ؟\nlimah?\n“For what?”\nThe shortened مَ is also used when it is the base noun in an annexation. However, in this case it won’t be joined to the previous word. For example:\nمِثْلُ مَ أَنْتَ؟ \n“What are you like?”Wright 1/275A\n\n\n30.2.3 مَا and مَنْ referred back to with an lowered-state pronoun\nAs an alternative to placing the question noun مَا or مَنْ after the preposition or annexe noun, the question noun may be placed in the beginning of the sentence and it is referred back to by a pronoun. For example,\nقُلْ مَنْ بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ \nSay, “In whose hand is the realm of all things”سورة المؤمنون 23:88\nمَاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ \n“for which [aspect] of it would the criminals be impatient?”سورة يونس 10:50\n\n\n30.2.4 Verb gender when inquiring about the doer of a verb\nThe question nouns مَا and مَنْ are themselves masculine singular nouns. But they can be used to ask abount nouns of any gender or number. For example,\nوَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ؟ \n“And what is that in your right hand?”سورة طه 20:17\nمَنْ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالُ؟\n“Who are these men?”\nWhen inquiring about the doer of a verb, then the verb is usually construed with a masculine singular doer to match the question noun. For example:\nمَنْ جَاءَ؟\n“Who has come?”\nمَا يُبْكِيكَ؟ \n“What makes you cry?”جامع الترمذي :3894\nOcassionally, the feminine verb may be used if asking about a feminine doer. For example:\nمَنْ كَانَتْ أُمَّكَ؟ 1 \n“Who was your mother?”Wright 2/313C\n\nIf the question is regarding a specific number and gender, then we are more likely to insert the corresponding specific connected noun (ٱلَّذِي, etc.) between the question noun مَن and the verb. For example:\nمَنِ اللَّتَانِ تَظَاهَرَتَا عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنْ أَزْوَاجِهِ \n“Who are the ones2f, from his wives, who aided one another against the Prophet ﷺ?صحيح البخاري :4913\nNote that now the dual feminine doer pronoun ا in تَظَاهَرَتَا is the refer-back pronoun that refers back to the connected noun ٱللَّتَانِ.\n\n\n30.2.5 An indefinite noun after مَا and مَنْ\nThe question nouns مَا and مَنْ cannot occur as annexe nouns. Nor can either of them be a replacee. So any indefinite noun after them must necessarily be the comment of the question sentence. For example, مَنْ فَارِسٌ؟  can only mean, “Who is a horseman?” not “Who horseman?” or “Which horseman?”Wright 2/312C\n\n\n30.2.6 مَاذَا and مَنْ ذَا\nTo lend more force to the question or to make it more lively, ذَا may be appended to the question nouns مَا and مَنْ. For example,\nمَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ \n“What did your lord say?”صحيح البخاري :4800\nWith مَنْ ذَا especially, but also with مَا, the specific connected noun ٱلَّذِي is often appended as well. For example:\nمَنْ ذَا الَّذِي قَالَ هَذَا \n“Who is the one that said this?”سنن ابن ماجه :3802\nمَاذَا ٱلَّذِي تَقُولُ؟ \n“What is it that you say?”Wright 2/312B\nNote that ذَا is also a variant pointing noun meaning “this” or “that”. In which case, it can be the comment of the question sentence by itself. For example:\n\nفَدَقَقْتُ الْبَابَ، فَقَالَ: مَنْ ذَا؟ فَقُلْتُ: أَنَا، قَالَ: أَنَا، أَنَا؟، كَأَنَّهُ كَرِهَهُ. \n“So I knocked at the door. He said, ‘Who is that?’ I said, ‘I.’ He said ‘I? I?’ as if he disliked it.”الأدب المفرد :1086\n\n\n30.2.7 Why\nArabic has no distinct question word for “why”. Instead, the question noun مَا is used with a preposition, typically لِ to give the meaning “For what?”. For example,\nلِمَ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ \n“Why did he do that?”صحيح مسلم :705b\nلِمَاذَا وَلَّيْتَ بَعْدَ مَجِيِّكَ إِلَىٰ هَـٰهُنَا؟ \n“Why did you turn back after your coming here?”Wright 2/312B\nSometimes, other prepositions like عَلَىٰ and بِ may be used. But this is dependent on the verb in the sentence. For example,\nعَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ \n“Why does one of you kill his brother?”\ni.e. “on what [basis]”مشكاة المصابيح :4562\nبِمَ يَأْخُذ أحدكُم مَال أَخِيه؟ \n“Why should any of you take his brother’s property?”\ni.e. “by what [justification]”مشكاة المصابيح :2840\nAnd often times, the meaning “why” is conveyed using مَا when a suitable verb exists. For example:\nمَا يُبْكِيكَ؟ \n“What makes you cry?”\ni.e. “Why are you crying?”جامع الترمذي :3894\n\n\n30.2.8 Applicability of مَا and مَنْ to intelligent and non-intelligent beings\nIn (give ref) we discussed how, sometimes, the connected noun مَا may be used for intelligent beings and مَنْ for non-intelligent beings. Those same guidelines apply for مَا and مَنْ when they are question nouns. For example, when inquiring about the nature or qualities of a person مَا may be used. Examples:\nفَقُلْتُ لَهُ مَا أَنْتَ قَالَ أَنَا نَبِيٌّ. فَقُلْتُ وَمَا نَبِيٌّ قَالَ أَرْسَلَنِي اللَّهُ \n“I said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am a prophet.’ So I said, ‘And who is a prophet?’ He said ‘Allāh has sent me.’”صحيح مسلم :832",

    "section": "30.3 أَيّ",
    "text": "30.3 أَيّ\nIn section .. we studied أَيّ as a general connected noun. Just like مَا and مَنْ, أَيّ too can be a question noun for “which” questions. Many of the rules that apply the question nouns مَا and مَنْ also apply to أَيّ. For example, the default position of أَيّ is in the beginning of the question sentence.\nHowever, أَيّ is also different from مَا and مَنْ in some respects. For example, consistent with what we learned in its use as a connected noun, the question noun أَيّ is a fully-flexible noun and can be used indiscriminately for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings.\nAlso, أَيّ is typically the annexe noun in an annexation. When أَيّ is a connected noun, then its base noun is usually definite. But when أَيّ is a question noun, then its base noun may be either definite or indefinite.\n\n30.3.1 أَيّ with a definite base noun\nWhen the base noun of أَيّ is a definite noun, the annexation has the meaning “which [one] of”. For example,\nفَأَيَّ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ تُنكِرُونَ \n“So which of the signs of Allāh do you deny?”سورة غافر 40:81\nأَيُّ الأَعْمَالِ أَفْضَلُ \n“Which of the deeds is best?”سنن أبي داود :1449\nفَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ \n“So which of the two parties has more right to security”سورة الأنعام 6:81\nمِنْ أَيِّ أَيَّامِ الشَّهْرِ كَانَ يَصُومُ \n“From which of the days of the month would he fast?”صحيح مسلم :1160\nAs in the examples above, the base noun in such a case is typically a plural or a dual. If the base noun is a definite singular noun, then there is an implied partitive meaning, i.e. “which part of”.2 For example,\n\nفِي أَيِّ طَعَامِهِ يُبَارَكُ لَهُ \n“in which (part) of his food is the blessing”سنن أبي داود :3845\nمِنْ أَيِّ الْمَالِ \n“From which (category) of wealth?”سنن أبي داود :4063\nHowever, if the noun is of generic definiteness then the partitive aspect indicates one out of the set that constitutes the generic type. In English the plural is often used to signify the generic type. For example the generic type ٱلْعَمَل “the deed” can be translated in English as “deeds”. So أَيُّ ٱلْعَمَلِ means “which one from the generic type ‘deeds’” or simply “which deed”. Examples:\nأَيُّ الْعَمَلِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ؟ \n“Which deed is most beloved to Allāh?”الأدب المفرد :1\nأَيُّ الدُّعَاءِ أَفْضَلُ \n“Which supplication is best?”الأدب المفرد :637\nأَيُّ الذَّنْبِ أَعْظَمُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ \n“Which deed is most enormous in the sight of Allāh?”صحيح البخاري :4477\n\n\n30.3.2 أَيّ with a indefinite base noun\nWhen the base noun of أَيّ is a indefinite noun, the annexation has the meaning “which” without “of”. For example,\nأَيَّ شَىْءٍ كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ \n“Which thing would you do?”سنن ابن ماجه :2606\nأَيَّ شَىْءٍ نَشْتَهِي \n“What thing shall we desire?”صحيح مسلم :1887\nأَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ \n“Which night is the night of Decree”جامع الترمذي :3513\nIf the base noun is a dual or plural indefinite then then inquiry is about the complete number, not just one of them. For example:\nأَيُّ رِجَالٍ؟ \n“Which men?”Wright 2/220A\nأَيُّ رَجُلَيْنِ؟ \n“Which two men?”Wright 2/220A\n\n\n30.3.3 Matching the rest of the question sentence with أَيّ\nأَيّ itself, like مَا and مَنْ, is singular masculine. For the purpose of matching the rest of the question sentence with أَيّ, either it can match the singular masculine to match with the word أَيّ, or it can match the gender and number of what أَيّ refers to. For example,\nأَيُّ أَزْوَاجِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم اسْتَعَاذَتْ مِنْهُ \nWhich of the wives of the Prophet sought refuge (fwith Allāh) from him?\n(اسْتَعَاذَتْ is a feminine verb to match the feminine “wife”.)صحيح البخاري :5254\nفَأَيُّ نِسَاءِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ أَحْظَى عِنْدَهُ مِنِّي \n“So which of the women of the Prophet was dearer to him than I?”\n(كَانَ is a masculine verb to match masculine أَيّ.)صحيح مسلم :1423\n\n\n30.3.4 أَيّ standalone without a base noun\nOccasionally, أَيّ is used without a base noun. It is then, technically, indefininte. However, the meaning of an annexation is still implicit. This may be when أَيّ has already been used once with an an annexation, and subsequent uses of أَيّ are restricted to the previously mentioned annexation. For example,\nأَيُّ الْعَمَلِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ؟ قَالَ الصَّلاَةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا، قُلْتُ ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟ \n“‘Which deed is most beloved to Allāh?’ He replied, ‘Prayer at its proper time.’ I said, ‘Then which?’”الأدب المفرد :1\nSee also section … below, where أَيّ is used standalone in a response.\n\n\n30.3.5 أَيّ annexed to multiple base nouns\nOne أَيّ may be annexed to multiple base nouns separated by وَ “and”. For example,\nأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْفَاكِهَةِ وَزِرَاعَةِ ٱلْقُطْنِ أَرْبَحُ؟ \n“Which one of the agriculture of fruit, and the agriculture of cotton is more profitable?”النحو الوافي 3/107\nIn such a case, it is optional to have one أَيّ or to repeat it. So we could also say, for the same meaning:\nأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْفَاكِهَةِ وَأَيُّ زِرَاعَةِ ٱلْقُطْنِ أَرْبَحُ؟\nHowever, if one of the base nouns is an attached pronoun  then repeating أَيّ is mandatory.3 Example:\nأَيِّي وَأَيُّكَ أَعْلَمُ؟\n“Which one of you and me is more knowledgeable?”\nأَيِّي وَأَيُّكَ is equivalent to أَيُّنَا but it spells out the two options to choose from.",

    "section": "30.6 Differentiating question words from their other functions",
    "text": "30.6 Differentiating question words from their other functions\nMany of the question words (أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc.) also have other functions. For example, in chapter @ref(the-connected-nouns) we learned that مَنْ, مَا, and أَيّ are also connected nouns. Many of the question nouns can also be used as conditional nouns that we will study in chapter @ref(…), if Allāh wills.\nIn this section, we will discuss briefly how to determine when words like أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc. are question words, and when they could have one of their other functions.\nThe basic principle regarding a question sentence is that it is to be treated as one unit. A word from within a question sentence is not, individually, affected by anything outside the question. Let’s try to understand this using an example.\nConsider the following sentence:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ\nʾisʾal ʾayyuhum qām\n“Ask: ‘Which of them stood?’”\nThe speaker is commanding the addressed person to ask a group of people the question: “Which of them stood”.\nThe question sentence is أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ ʾayyuhum qām “Which of them stood”. This entire sentence is considered the direct doee of the verb of command ٱسْأَلْ “ask!”. The question noun أَيُّ ʾayyu is in the raised-state because it is the subject of the question sentence. It does not become أَيَّ ʾayya in the propped-state because it is not, by itself, the direct doee of ٱسْأَلْ. Rather, as we have just stated, the entire question sentence is the direct doee. But because the direct doee is a sentence, and not an individual word, it does not indicate its state using, for example, an fat·ḥah ◌َ.\nNow, let’s modify the example. Consider now this sentence:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيَّهُمْ قَامَ\nʾisʾal ʾayyahum qām\nAsk the one of them who stood!\nNow, the noun أَيَّ is in the propped-state because it (individually) is the direct doee of the verb of command ٱسْأَلْ. The speaker is now commanding the addressed person to ask (something) of only the person who stood, out of a group of people. The rest of the people are not to be asked. Because the noun أَيَّ is individually affected by the preceding verb ٱسْأَلْ it is now not a question noun, and must be one of the other functions that the word أَيّ can have. As a matter of fact, it is here a connected noun, and the sentence following it: قَامَ “he stood” is its connecting sentence.\nThe other noteworthy point regarding questions (besides their being considered one unit) is that they may only be preceded either by a verb of knowledge, (like عَلِمَ, دَرىٰ, etc.) or by an expression indicating that the question is being quoted. We have already seen an example of the question being quoted in the example:\nٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ\n“Ask: ‘Which of them stood?’”\nAn example of a question being preceded by a verb of knowledge is:\nمَا عَلِمْتُ أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ\nI don’t know whether he went or stayed.\nHere the question sentence is: أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ “Did he go or did he stay?”\nBy the way, a question sentence may be part of a bigger question as well. For example:\nأَتَدْرِي أَيُّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟\nʾatadrī ʾayyuhum fi -ddār\nDo you know: which of them is in the house?\nNote now the subtle difference in meaning if we change the state of أَيّ in the above example from the raised-state to the propped-state:\nأَتَدْرِي أَيَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟\nʾatadrī ʾayyahum fi -ddār\nDo you know the one of them who is in the house?\nWhen أَيّ was in the raised-state it was a question noun. And the speaker was asking the addressed person if he could figure out who, from among the group of people, was in the house.\nWhen أَيّ is in the propped-state it is now a connected noun. The connecting sentence’s refer-back pronoun is omitted (as is permissible in this case, see section @ref(…)). With the refer-back pronoun restored, the sentence is أَتَدْرِي أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟ And the speaker is asking the addressed person if he is familiar with the person who is in the house. Now he is not asking the addressed person to identify him, but rather if knows him as a person.\nThis difference is apparent with أَيّ because it is a flexible noun whose state is indicated by the vowel mark at its end. The same occurs in the other question nouns that are also connected nouns: مَا, and مَنْ but it won’t often be as apparent because they are rigid nouns.\nAs a final note, sometimes, one of the words like أَ, مَنْ, مَا, كَيْفَ, etc. may be preceded by parts of a sentence that are neither quoting, nor a verb of knowledge. Here we can be sure that the word is not a question word and must be one of its other functions. However, it still may not be easy to figure out what that other function is. Nevertheless, the meaning of the sentence can still usually be gleaned. For example:\nفَلْتَدْخُلْ مِنْ أَيِّ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ شَاءَتْ\n“then let her enter from whichever of the doors of paradise she wishes.”[^question-vs-other-functions]",

Note that the combination ءا is not written as آ when the alif is part of the suffix.\n\n\n\nA.2.3 Tanwīn on final hamzah\nTanwīn on final hamzah does not affect the writing of the hamzah except in the case of a tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً. When writing a tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً on a hamzah at the end of a word:\n\nIf there is an alif before a unseated hamzah اء, then we don’t add a silent alif when writing the tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً. For example دَاء becomes دَاءً dāʾan, not دَاءًا.\nOtherwise, we add the silent alif after the hamzah so that the hamzah is now in the middle of the word with a suffix alif after it. We now pretend that the hamzah has an fat·ḥah and that the alif after it is a long-ā vowel. Then we go through the rules for writing hamzah in the middle of a word (given above) to determine how hamzah will be written. We then write the tanwīned fat·ḥah ◌ً on the hamzah. Examples:\n\n\n مُبْتَدَأ becomes مُبْتَدَأٌ، مُبْتَدَءًا، مُبْتَدَإٍ\n مَلْجَأ becomes مَلْجَأٌ، مَلْجَءًا، مَلْجَإٍ\n جُزْء becomes جُزْءٌ، جُزْءًا، جُزْءٍ\n شَيْء becomes شَيْءٌ، شَيْءًا، شَيْءٍ\n سَيِّئ becomes سَيِّئٌ, سَيِّئًا, سَيِّئٍ\n\n\n\nA.2.4 Variants\nThere are some historical and regional variants to the above rules. The main one is when the letter before hamzah has a sukūn, the hamzah is generally written unseated. So with this variant, we write:\n\n مَسْءَلَة instead of مَسْأَلَة\n\nHowever, this rule appears to be not consistently followed. For example, nas͡hʾah is generally always written نَشْأَة never نَشْءَة.\n\nAnother variant is that when word final hamzah has an kasrah and is followed by a suffix starting with ū, then the hamzah is written unseated instead of as ئ. Examples:\n\n مُتَّكِءُون muttakiʾūn instead of مُتَّكِئُون\n يُطْفِءُوا yuṭfiʾū instead of يُطْفِئُوا\n مُسْتَهْزِءُون mustahziʾūn instead of مُسْتَهْزِئُون\n مُنْشِءُون muns͡hiʾūn instead of مُنْشِئُون\n يُضَاهِءُونَ yuḍāhiʾūna instead of يُضَاهِئُونَ\n مُرْجِءُون murjiʾūn instead of مُرْجِئُون\n مُرْجِءُون murjiʾūn instead of مُرْجِئُون\n رَئِيس raʾīs instead of رَءِيس\n\nExcepted from this variant are deficient words like:\n\n فِئُون fiʾūn\n\n مِئُون miʾūn\n\nAnother, more modern, variant is to modify the precedence rule of vowels. According to this modern variant, the vowel before hamzah is compared with the shortened vowel on the hamzah. This can result in some changes in the hamzah seat. For example:\n\n مَسْؤُول masʾūl instead of مَسْءُول\n رُؤُوس ruʾūs instead of رُءُوس\n ٱقْرَؤُوا iqraʾū instead of ٱقْرَءُوا\n\nExcepted from this variant is the combination aʾā which will continue to be written as ـَءَا or ـَآ. For example: شَنَآن, مُرْجَءَات.",

    "text": "A.3 Why so complicated?\nHamzah was originally not pronounced everywhere in some Classical Arabic dialects. For speakers of these dialects, when hamzah would occur in the middle of a word, they would replace it with an a, u, or i vowel. So they would adjust their pronunciation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProununciation with hamzah\nProununciation without hamzah\n\n\n\n\nهَيْءَة hayʾah\nهَيَّة hayyah\n\n\nخَطِيءَة k͡haṭīʾah\nخَطِيَّة k͡haṭiyyah\n\n\nتَوْءَم tawʾam\nتَوَّم tawwam\n\n\nتَسَاؤُل tasāʾul\nتَسَاوُل tasāwul\n\n\nبِئْسَ biʾsa\nبِيسَ bīsa\n\n\nسُؤْل suʾl\nسُول sūl\n\n\nكَأْس kaʾs\nكَاس kās\n\n\n\nWhen the Classical Standard Arabic variety emerged, then, for reasons that are beyond the scope of this text, the pronunciation with hamzah and the consonantal spelling without hamzah became standardized. So ء is now added as a pronunciation mark on top of the various seats that would instead have been dialectally pronounced without hamzah.",

Example: خَطِيـَٔة. The Unicode input sequence is:\nu+0640 arabic tatweel\nu+0654 arabic hamza above\nThis is a more accurate approximation, but some fonts may not position the hamzah correctly on the taṭwīl, or position vowel marks on the superscript hamzah correctly.\nHamzah seated on yāʾ: ئ. Example: خَطِيئَة. This is a reprehensible, yet more prevalent, and better supported, approximation.\n\nBeware, though, that neither of these approximations would allow for the correct rendering of a complex (but thankfully rare) word like لَءَّال laʾʾāl “pearl seller”, where the hamzah is not allowed to disturb the lām-alif ligature لا.",

    "text": "C.1 “There is a …” sentences.\nIn English the plain existence of an indefinite subject is expressed using the word “there”. For example:\nThe word “there” in these examples does not indicate a specific place. Rather it signifies the existence of the subject of the sentence. This use of “there” is called the existential “there”.\nExpressing such sentences in Arabic can sometimes be tricky. There is a modern tendency to use the ḍ͡harf makan هُنَاكَ and the majhūl verb يُوجَدُ.  So one might find:\nSometimes in place of هُنَاكَ, its synonym, ثَمَّةَ is used. These usages of هُنَاكَ, ثَمَّةَ, and يُوجَدُ are foreign to Arabic and should generally be avoided.\nIn Classical Arabic, expressing such sentences falls under the category of sentences with indefinite subjects. We have discussed this topic in chapter @ref(chap-indef-subjects).\nThere are various strategies for expressing such sentences:\nIf, for example, there is a jārr wa-majrūr, or other s͡hibh jumlah then it can readily be used as a k͡habar that precedes the mubtadaʾ. For example:\nفِي ٱلْبَيتِ حَزَنٌ.\n“In the house is gloom.”\nSometimes, a jārr wa-majrūr, or other s͡hibh jumlah is not original, but can readily be manufactured. For example, in the sentence, “There are reasons.” the reasons must be for something, and that something can be used as a k͡habar:\nلِلْوَضْعِ أَسْبَابٌ.\n“For the situation, are reasons.”\nSimilarly, a introductory sentence or s͡hibh jumlah can be manufactured to pave the way for the main sentence. For example:\nالغَضَبُ غَضَبَانِ: غَضَبٌ مُسْتَحَبٌّ وَغَضَبٌ مَكْرُوهٌ.\n“Anger is (actually) two angers: an anger that is liked, and an anger that is disliked.”\nمَنَ ٱلْغَضَبِ مَا يٌسْتَحَبُّ وَمَا يٌكْرَهُ.\n“From anger is that which is liked, that which is disliked.”\nSometimes it hard to come up with any of the above solutions, as in the sentence: “There is a god.” Such sentences, if they are able to be converted to an interjection, may be expressed with the subject itself as a one word sentence1:\nإِلَـٰهٌ!\n“[There is] a god!”\nThis solution should only be considered if the sentence makes sense as an interjection, and can not be used as a blanket solution. For example, in the exchange:\n“Is there food?”\n“Yes, there is food.”\nOne way to express this in Arabic is:\nهَلْ مِنْ طَعَامٍ؟\nنَعَمْ، عِنْدَنَا طَعَامٌ.\nEnglish also uses the word “there” with this existential meaning for sentences like:\nThese sentences can be expressed in Arabuc without indefinite subjects. For example:",

(See section @ref(la-nafiyah-lil-jins).)\n\n\nC.1.1 Legitimate use of هُنَاكَ and يُوجَدُ\nIf, of course, a place is intended by “there” then there is no problem using هُنَاكَ or its synonyms. For example:\nأَثَمَّ زَيْدٌ؟\n“Is Zayd there?”\nSimilarly, يُوجَدُ may be used with no problem if the meaning “is (to be) found” is intended. For example:\nمن قتل معاهدا لم يرح رائحة الجنة، وإن ريحها توجد من مسيرة أربعين عاماً\n\n\nC.1.2 Technical and scientific use of يوجَد\nOur above directive to avoid the use of يوجد to mean “there is” holds for normal sentences. Sometimes, however, a more technical meaning of “exists” is intended, especially in the language of science.  In this case, يوجد and its ism mafɛūl موجود may be used when needing to discuss the existence of something in a scientific text. But such usage should be restricted to its domain, and should not, ideally, spill over to normal sentences, where a simple “there is” is intended.\nWhile this concession can be granted to يوجد, we find no such justifying circumstance for using هناك existentially.",

    "text": "C.2 Pronoun of separation after question nouns\nIn later writing we find the following forms:\nمَنْ هِيَ زَيْنَب؟\nWho is Zaynab?\nمَا هُوَ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ؟\nWhat is Islām?\nلِمَاذَا هُوَ حَزِينٌ؟\nWhy is he sad?\nThe insertion of the pronoun of separation (هُوَ, هِيَ, etc.) after question nouns is best avoided. So it is better to say:\nمَنْ زَيْنَب؟\nWho is Zaynab?\nمَا ٱلْإِسْلَامُ؟\nWhat is Islām?\nAs for “why” sentences, Arabic has a native expression using مَا لِ followed by a noun or pronoun in the lowered-state and then an adjective in the propped-state. For example:\nمَا لَهُ حَزِينًا؟\nWhy is he sad?\nAnother option, that is sometimes possible, is to convert the “why” question into a “what” question, thus:\nمَا أَحْزَنَهُ\nWhy is he sad? (literally: What has made him sad?)",

    "text": "D.1.1 شَرْق, غَرْبَ, بَرّ, and بَحْر as adverbs of place\nThere are some examples of شَرْق, غَرْبَ, بَرّ, and بَحْر being used apparently as adverbs of place. For example:\nFrom تأويل مختلف الحديث لابن قتيبة, p. 127:\n\nوَتَقَرَّبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى بِاتِّبَاعِهِمْ سُنَنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، وَطَلَبِهِمْ لِآثَارِهِ وَأَخْبَارِهِ، بَرًّا وَبَحْرًا وَشَرْقًا وَغَرْبًا\n\nFrom Wright 2/111B:\nانتصر على العدو برًّا وبحرًا\nThese nouns aren’t listed in the grammar books as permissible for ظرف زمان. And some grammarians don’t even allow داخل, خارج, ناحية, etc which are more vague than the words in question. So should they be allowed?\nPerhaps شَرْق, غَرْبَ can fall under ما ينوب عن الظرف because they are maṣdars like قُرْب and بُعْد. But their meaning seems to be of the directions or locations “east” and “west” rather than the maṣdar meaning of “rising of the sun” and “setting of the sun” respectedly. But it seems a stretch to allow بَرّ, and بَحْر under this category.\nMaybe they could be exceptions like مُطِرْنا السهلَ والجَبَل and ضُرِبَ الظهرَ والبطن but then the grammarians would have listed them as such.\nCould other nouns, similar to these be permitted as ظرف مكان? How about جوّ, صَعِيد, جزيرة, صحراء, etc.?\nMaybe the requirement of vagueness is lifted when contrasting two or more adverbs. So التمسته برًّا by itself wouldn’t be acceptable, but التمسته برًّا وبحرًا is acceptable?\n\n\nD.1.2 Requiring the meaning of stopping or remaining استقرار for adverbs of place\nFrom شرح الرضي على الكافية 1/489–491]:\n\nوينبغي أن يستثنى من المبهم في قوله، أيضا: نحو جانب وما بمعناه، وكذا جوف البيت وخارج الدار، وداخلها، وكذا بعض ما في أوله ميم زائدة من اسم مكان، لأنه إنما يثبت مثل هذا الاسم للمكان باعتبار الحدث الواقع فيه، والحدث شئ خارج عن مسمى المكان، مع أنه لا ينتصب كل ما هو من هذا الجنس، فلا يقال: نمت مضرب زيد، وقمت مصرعه، بل هذا النوع من المكان يدخله تفصيل، وذلك بان يقال: اسم المكان: إما أن يشتق من حدث بمعنى الاستقرار والكون في مكان، أو، لا، والثاني لا ينتصب على الظرفية إلا بالفعل الذي ينتصب به على الظرفية المختص من المكان، كدخلت، ونزلت وسكنت، وهو كالمضرب والمقتل والمأكل والمشرب ونحوها. والأول ينصبه على الظرفية الفعل المشتق مما اشتق منه اسم المكان نحو: المجلس والمقعد، والمأوى، والمسد، والمقيل والمبيت، فتقول: قاتلت موضع القتال، ونصرت مكان النصر، وكذا تقول: قمت مقامه، وجلست مجلسه، وأويت مأواه، وسددت مسده، وينصبه، أيضا، كل ما فيه معنى الاستقرار، وإن لم يشتق مما اشتق منه، نحو: جلست موضع القيام، وتحركت مكان السكون، وقعدت موضعك، ومكان زيد، وجلست منزل فلان وقعدت مركزة، قال تعالى: “واقعدوا لهم كل مرصد” ، وكذا: نمت مبيته، وأقمت مشتاه.\nوما ليس فيه معنى الاستقرار لا ينصبه، فلا يقال: كتبت الكتاب مكانك، ورميت بالسهم موضع بكر، وقتلته مكان المقراة وشتمتك منزل فلان، وقال الأكثرون من المتقدمين المبهم من المكان هو الجهات الست، والموقت ما سواها، وهذا القول هو الذي ذكره المصنف في الكافية، ثم قالوا: حمل عند، ولدي، وبين ووسط الدار، من الموقت على الجهات الست فانتصبت انتصابها لمشابهتها للجهات في الابهام. قال المصنف: وكذا حمل لفظ مكان، على الجهات، لا لابهامه، فان قولك جلست مكان زيد، لا إبهام هنا في لفظ مكان، بل لكثرة استعماله، فحذف “في” منه تخفيفا، ولا ينبغي للمصنف هذا الاطلاق، فان لفظ مكان لا ينتصب إلا بما فيه معنى الاستقرار فلا يقال: كتبت المصحف مكان ضرب زيد، كم قدمنا.\n\nSo according to الرضي, an اسم مكان as a ظرف مكان is only restricted to the verb from which it is derived if it does not have the meaning of استقرار. Otherwise, if it does have استقرار you can mix and match. He gives some examples like: نمت مبيته and واقعدوا لهم كل مرصد[سورة التوبة 9:5].\nSee also أبو حيان’s analysis for this verse:\n\nقالَ الزَّمَخْشَرِيُّ: (كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ) كُلَّ مَمَرٍّ ومُجْتازٍ تَرْصُدُونَهم فِيهِ، وانْتِصابُهَ عَلى الظَّرْفِ كَقَوْلِهِ: ﴿لَأقْعُدَنَّ لَهم صِراطَكَ المُسْتَقِيمَ﴾ [الأعراف: ١٦] انْتَهى. وهَذا الَّذِي قالَهُ الزَّجّاجُ، قالَ: (كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ) ظَرْفٌ، كَقَوْلِكَ: ذَهَبْتُ مَذْهَبًا، ورَدَّهُ أبُو عَلِيٍّ؛ لِأنَّ المَرْصَدَ المَكانُ الَّذِي يُرْصَدُ فِيهِ العَدُوُّ، فَهو مَكانٌ مَخْصُوصٌ لا يُحْذَفُ الحَرْفُ مِنهُ إلّا سَماعًا كَما حَكى سِيبَوَيْهِ: دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ، وكَما عَسَلَ الطَّرِيقَ الثَّعْلَبُ انْتَهى. وأقُولُ: يَصِحُّ انْتِصابُهُ عَلى الظَّرْفِ؛ لِأنَّ قَوْلَهُ: (واقْعُدُوا لَهم) لَيْسَ مَعْناهُ حَقِيقَةَ القُعُودِ، بَلِ المَعْنى ارْصُدُوهم في كُلِّ مَكانٍ يُرْصَدُ فِيهِ، ولَمّا كانَ بِهَذا المَعْنى جازَ قِياسًا أنْ يُحْذَفَ مِنهُ في كَما قالَ: وقَدْ قَعَدُوا أنْفاقَها كُلَّ مَقْعَدٍ. فَمَتى كانَ العامِلُ في الظَّرْفِ المُخْتَصِّ عامِلًا مِن لَفْظِهِ أوْ مِن مَعْناهُ، جازَ أنْ يَصِلَ إلَيْهِ بِغَيْرِ واسِطَةِ ”في“، فَيَجُوزُ جَلَسْتُ مَجْلِسَ زِيدٍ، وقَعَدْتُ مَجْلِسَ زِيدٍ، تُرِيدُ في مَجْلِسِ زِيدٍ، فَكَما يَتَعَدّى الفِعْلُ إلى المَصْدَرِ مِن غَيْرِ لَفْظِهِ إذا كانَ بِمَعْناهُ، فَكَذَلِكَ إلى الظَّرْفِ. وقالَ الأخْفَشُ: مَعْناهُ عَلى كُلِّ مَرْصَدٍ، فَحُذِفَ وأُعْمِلَ الفِعْلُ، وحُذِفَ ”عَلى“، ووُصُولُ الفِعْلِ إلى مَجْرُورِها فَتَنْصِبُهُ، يَخُصُّهُ أصْحابُنا بِالشِّعْرِ، وأنْشَدُوا: تَحِنُّ فَتُبْدِي ما بِها مِن صَبابَةٍ ∗∗∗ وأُخْفِي الَّذِي لَوْلا الأسى لَقَضانِي\n\nالبحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة التوبة 9:5\nHowever, for the verse لَأقْعُدَنَّ لَهم صِراطَكَ المُسْتَقِيمَ [سورة الأعراف 7:16] he says:\n\nوانْتَصَبَ ”صِراطَكَ“ عَلى إسْقاطِ عَلى. قالَهُ الزَّجّاجُ، وشَبَّهَهُ بِقَوْلِ العَرَبِ ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ الظَّهْرَ والبَطْنَ، أيْ: عَلى الظَّهْرِ والبَطْنِ وإسْقاطُ حَرْفِ الجَرِّ لا يَنْقاسُ في مِثْلِ هَذا. لا يُقالُ قَعَدْتُ الخَشَبَةَ تُرِيدُ قَعَدْتُ عَلى الخَشَبَةِ قالُوا: أيْ: عَلى الظَّرْفِ كَما قالَ الشّاعِرُ فِيهِ: كَما عَسَلَ الطَّرِيقَ الثَّعْلَبُ\nوهَذا أيْضًا تَخْرِيجٌ فِيهِ ضَعْفٌ؛ لِأنَّ صِراطَكَ ظَرْفُ مَكانٍ مُخْتَصٌّ، وكَذَلِكَ الطَّرِيقُ فَلا يَتَعَدّى إلَيْهِ الفِعْلُ إلّا بِواسِطَةِ في، وما جاءَ خِلافَ ذَلِكَ شاذٌّ، أوْ ضَرُورَةٌ وعَلى الضَّرُورَةِ أنْشَدُوا: كَما عَسَلَ الطَّرِيقَ الثَّعْلَبُ\nوما ذَهَبَ إلَيْهِ أبُو الحُسَيْنِ بْنُ الطَّراوَةِ مِن أنَّ الصِّراطَ والطَّرِيقَ ظَرْفٌ مُبْهَمٌ لا مُخْتَصٌّ، رَدَّهُ عَلَيْهِ أهْلُ العَرَبِيَّةِ، والأوْلى أنْ يُضَمَّنَ لَأقْعُدَنَّ مَعْنى ما يَتَعَدّى بِنَفْسِهِ فَيَنْتَصِبُ الصِّراطُ عَلى أنَّهُ مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ، والتَّقْدِيرُ: لَألْزَمَنَّ بِقُعُودِي صِراطَكَ المُسْتَقِيمَ\n\nالبحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة الأعراف 7:16\nAlso, according to الرضي, generic place nouns like مكان have no special exemption as adverbs of place. They may only be used as such with the meaning of استقرار.\nBut I have found the narration:\nفَتُصَلِّيَ فِي بَيْتِي مَكَانًا [سنن ابن ماجه :754]\n“that you may pray in my house (at) a place”\nSo maybe they are allowed when indefinite even without the meaning of استقرار?\nSee also the verse: وإذا أُلْقُوا مِنها مَكانًا ضَيِّقًا مُقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْا هُنالِكَ ثُبُورًا [سورة الفرقان 25:13].\nأبو حيان says [البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for سورة الفرقان 25:13]:\n\nوانْتَصَبَ (مَكانًا) عَلى الظَّرْفِ أيْ في مَكانٍ ضَيِّقٍ\n\nBut ابن عاشور says:\n\nوانْتَصَبَ (مَكانًا) عَلى نَزْعِ الخافِضِ، أيْ: في مَكانٍ ضَيِّقٍ\n\nThis makes more sense to me because the action of the verb ألقى is not ocurring in the مكان so it doesn’t seem to fulfil the requirement for a ظرف مكان\n\n\nD.1.3 tanwīn on أفعل التفضيل when used adverbially\nThe tanwīn on أَوَّلًا is well documented. But it is treated as an exceptional case.\nIs it possible that all أفعل التفضيل can take tanwīn when used adverbially? Not just as ظرف, but also, حال, etc., and especially تمييز.\nI find this in الإبانة في اللغة العربية للصحاري, 1/439:\n\nوقال الراجز:\nقبحتم يا آل عوف نفرا … ألأم قوم أصغراً وأكبرا\nيريد: صغيراً وكبيراً.\nويقال: إن لها أسفلاً وأعلى، وأوسطاً وأدنىً وأقصىً، منون كله.\n\nIs this presented as non-standard dialectal usage?\nI have been able to find some poetry with أسفلا but always at the end of a مصرع. So it may be poetic license or rhyme that allows it there. This poetry may not be from عصر الرواية. For example:\n\nما يريك النجم إلاَّ أسفلا\nألْقى بِأَعْلَى عَرْشه أسفلا\nوَيُنْقَطُ الْمُهْمَلُ لاَ الْحَا أَسْفَلاَ\nأرى قرنك الأعلى واياك أسفلا\n\n\n\nD.1.4 أول a ظرف مكان in an إضافة\n[النحو الوافي 3/152–153] presents these examples of أول a ظرف مكان:\n\nأَسْرَعْتُ لِلصَّارِخِ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُسْتَمِعِينَ\nأَسْرَعْتُ لِلصَّارِخِ أَوَّلَ\nأَسْرَعْتُ لِلصَّارِخِ أَوَّلًا\nأَسْرَعْتُ لِلصَّارِخِ أَوَّلُ\n\nIt may be possible that they are ظرف analagous to أسفل سافلين (see: https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/95/5). But I’m not quoting them because their ظرف meaning does not seem straightforward. If we say “I rushed to the the crier the first of the listeners.” then أول is not apparently signifying the time in which I rushed. It rather signifies حال I think.\n\n\nD.1.5 ناصب (إذا)\nFrom https://jamharah.net/showthread.php?p=49820, https://shamela.ws/book/17037/201#p1:\n\nالجمهور على أن ناصب (إذا) هو جوابها، والمحققون على أن الناصب هو شرطها. قال أبو حيان في [البحر:1/64]: «والذي نختاره أن الجملة بعدها التي تليها هي الناصبة لإذا، لأنها شرطية وأن ما بعدها ليس في موضع خفض بالإضافة، فحكمها حكم الظروف التي يجازي بها». وضعف أبو حيان مذهب الجمهور بأن الجواب يقترن به ما لا يعمل ما بعده فيما قبله كالفاء الرابطة، و(إذا) الفجائية، و(إن) و(ما) النافيتين انظر [البحر:6/312]، و[المغني:1/89-93]. و[الرضي:2/103] جاء جواب (إذا) مقترنًا بالفاء الرابطة، وبإذا الفجائية في آيات كثيرة، كما جاء الجواب جملة اسمية فيها ما يمنعها من العمل فيما قبلها مثل تصديرها بما، و(إن) النافيتين، أو بلا النافية للجنس، أو بإن المكسورة المشددة، أو فيها مصدر لا يعمل فيما قبله أو مصدر موصوف، وكل هذا يؤيد رأي المحققين في أن ناصب (إذا) هو شرطها. وانظر [إعراب القرآن للزجاج:ص882].\nومن يرى أن الناصب لإذا هو جوابها فيقول: الفاء الرابطة لا تمنع من عمل الجواب في (إذا). قال [العكبري:1/48] في قوله تعالى: {فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُمْ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِنْدَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ} [2: 198] و(إذا) ظرف، والعامل فيها {فَاذْكُرُوا}، ولا تمنع الفاء هنا من عمل ما بعدها فيما قبلها، هذا ما قاله العكبري هنا، ولكنه قال في قوله تعالى: {وَإِذَا جَاءَكَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا فَقُلْ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ} [6: 54]: «العامل في (إذا) معنى الجواب، أي سلم عليهم» [1/136-137] وقال الزمخشري في قوله تعالى: {إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ * وَرَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِي دِينِ اللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًا * فَسَبِّحْ} [110: 1-3]: «(إذا) منصوبة بسبح» [الكشاف:4/239].\nوقال الرضي في [«شرح الكافية»:2/104]: «الفاء زائدة. زيدت ليكون الكلام على صورة الشرط والجزاء: وإنما حكما بزيادتها، لأن فائدتها التعقيب كما ذكرنا أن السببية لا تخلو من معنى التعقيب و{إِذَا جَاءَ} ظرف للتسبيح، فلا يكون التسبيح عقب المجيء، بل وفي وقت المجيء».\nوفي آيات كثيرة نراهم يقدرون عاملاً لإذا دل عليه الجواب كما في قوله تعالى:\n\n{كَلَّا إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِيَ * وَقِيلَ مَنْ ۜ رَاقٍ * وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ * وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ * إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ} [75: 26-30]. في [العكبري:2/145]: «العامل في (إذا) معنى {إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ} أي إذا بلغت الحلقوم رفعت إلى الله تعالى».\n{وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ} [13: 11]. في [العكبري:2/33]: «العامل في (إذا) ما دل عليه الجواب، أي لم يرد أو وقع».\n{فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِي النَّاقُورِ * فَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ} [74: 8- 9]. انتصب (إذا) بما دل عليه الجزاء: [الكشاف:4/157]، [العكبري:2/144]. في إعراب [الزجاج:ص888]: «أي عسر ذلك اليوم يومئذ».\n{وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا هَلْ نَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ يُنَبِّئُكُمْ إِذَا مُزِّقْتُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّكُمْ لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ} [34: 7]. العامل في (إذا) ما دل عليه {إِنَّكُمْ لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ}. [الكشاف:3/252]، [العكبري:2/101]، [البحر:7/259]، في [إعراب القرآن للزجاج:3/882]: «العامل مزقتم».\n{أَفَلَا يَعْلَمُ إِذَا بُعْثِرَ مَا فِي الْقُبُورِ * وَحُصِّلَ مَا فِي الصُّدُورِ * إِنَّ رَبَّهُمْ بِهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَخَبِيرٌ} [100: 9- 11]. في [العكبري:2/158] «العامل في (إذا) (يعلم) وقيل: العامل فيه ما دل عليه خبر (إِنَّ)».\n{مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انْفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ} [9: 38]. في [الكشاف:2/152]: «قرئ {آثَّاقَلْتُمْ} على الاستفهام الذي معناه الإنكار والتوبيخ، فإن قلت: فما العامل في (إذا) وحرف الاستفهام مانع أن يعمل فيه؟. قلت: ما دل عليه قوله: {آثَّاقَلْتُمْ} أو ما في (لكم) من معنى الفعل»، هذه القراءة لأبي عمرو من الشواذ [ابن خالويه:53]. وتقدم لنا الحديث في عامل (أئذا) مع اقتران الجواب بالاستفهام.\n\n[دراسات عضيمة: ق1، ج1،ص197]",

    "text": "D.4 The connected noun\n\nD.4.1 Other أسماء الاستفهام used as أسماء موصولة\nFischer claims (§427):\n\nOther interrogatives (§289) are also used as relatives: عَرَفَ ٱلْمَكِيدَةَ وَكَيْفَ كَانَ ٱلْمَلِكُ أَوْقَعَهَا ‘He knew the trick and how the king employed it.’ وَٱللّٰهِ مَا نُبَالِي أَيْنَ ذَهَبَ ‘By God, we do not care where he went’; cf. also §419b.\n\nHowever, we have not been able to find the classical grammarians including كيف, أين, etc. among الأسماء الموصولة. To understand how these interrogatives are to be analyzed in such sentences, it may help to look up the إعراب of the verses : هُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الْأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ [3:6], and لِيُرِيَهُ كَيْفَ يُوَارِي سَوْءَةَ أَخِيهِ [5:31] in linguisitic tafsīrs like البحر المحيط لأبي حيان and التحرير والتنوير لابن عاشور.\nThe article ٱل is also generally included among الأسماء الموصولة المشتركة. However, we have deemed it too complicated to cover (and too confusing to even mention in main text). See النحو الوافي لعباس حسن vol. 1, pp. 356–357 for its treatment.\n\n\nD.4.2 \nFrom كتاب المقتصد في شرح الإيضاح للجرجاني, vol. 1, p. 319:\n\nومَن لا يوصف به، ألا ترى لا تقول: مررت بالرجل مَن أخوه منطلق. فتجعله صفةً للرجل، كما تقول: بالرجل الذي أخوه منطلق\n\nAlso شرح الرضي على الكافية لابن الحاجب vol. 2, p. 314:\n\nولا يقع من الموصولات وصفا إلا ما في أوله اللام، نحو الذي والتي، واللاتي، وبابها، لمشابهته لفظا للصفة المشبهة في كونه على ثلاثة أحرف فصاعدا، بخلاف من وما، وأما (أي) الموصول فلم يقع وصفا، لأن الأغلب فيه: الشرط والاستفهام ووقوعه موصولا قليل فروعي ذلك الأكثر، وإنما يوصف بذو، الطائية وإن كانت على حرفين كما في قوله:\n٣٢٧ - فقولا لهذا المرء ذو جاء ساعيا … هلم فان المشرفي الفرائض\n\nBasically, of الأسماء الموصولة المشتركة (which comprise ما, مَن, أي, أل, ذو, ذا) only the dialectal ذو appears as a صفة.\n\n\nD.4.3 \nFrom شرح ابن عقيل على ألفية ابن مالك:\n\nوأشار بقوله وأبوا أن يختزل إن صلح الباقي لوصل مكمل إلى أن شرط حذف صدر الصلة أن لا يكون ما بعده صالحا لأن يكون صلة كما إذا وقع بعده جملة نحو جاء الذي هو أبوه منطلق أو هو ينطلق أو ظرف أو جار ومجرور تامان نحو جاء الذي هو عندك أو هو في الدار فإنه لا يجوز في هذه المواضع حذف صدر الصلة فلا تقول جاء الذي أبوه منطلق تعني الذي هو أبوه منطلق لأن الكلام يتم دونه فلا يدرى أحذف منه شيء أم لا؟ وكذا بقية الأمثلة المذكورة ولا فرق في ذلك بين أي وغيرها فلا تقول في يعجبني أيهم هو يقوم يعجبني أيهم يقوم لأنه لا يعلم الحذف ولا يختص هذا الحكم بالضمير إذا كان مبتدأ بل الضابط أنه متى احتمل الكلام الحذف وعدمه لم يجز حذف العائد وذلك كما إذا كان في الصلة ضمير غير ذلك الضمير المحذوف صالح لعوده على الموصول نحو جاء الذي ضربته في داره فلا يجوز حذف الهاء من ضربته فلا تقول جاء الذي ضربت في داره لأنه لا يعلم المحذوف.\nوبهذا يظهر لك ما في كلام المصنف من الإبهام فإنه لم يبين أنه متى صلح ما بعد الضمير لأن يكون صلة لا يحذف سواء أكان الضمير مرفوعا أو منصوبا أو مجرورا وسواء أكان الموصول أيا أم غيرها بل ربما يشعر ظاهر كلامه بأن الحكم مخصوص بالضمير المرفوع وبغير أي من الموصولات لأن كلامه في ذلك والأمر ليس كذلك بل لا يحذف مع أي ولا مع غيرها متى صلح ما بعدها لأن يكون صلة كما تقدم نحو جاء الذي هو أبوه منطلق ويعجبني أيهم هو أبوه منطلق وكذلك المنصوب والمجرور نحو جاءني الذي ضربته في داره ومررت بالذي مررت به في داره ويعجبني أيهم ضربته في داره ومررت بأيهم مررت به في داره.\n\n\n\nD.4.4 \nFrom تفسير القرطبي:\n\nقوله تعالى : ثم آتينا موسى الكتاب مفعولان . تماما مفعول من أجله أو مصدر . على الذي أحسن قرئ بالنصب والرفع . فمن رفع - وهي قراءة يحيى بن يعمر وابن أبي إسحاق - فعلى تقدير : تماما على الذي هو أحسن . قال المهدوي : وفيه بعد من أجل حذف المبتدأ العائد على الذي . وحكى سيبويه عن الخليل أنه سمع ” ما أنا بالذي قائل لك شيئا ” . ومن نصب فعلى أنه فعل ماض داخل في الصلة ; هذا قول البصريين . وأجاز الكسائي والفراء أن يكون اسما نعتا ل ” الذي ” وأجازا ” مررت بالذي أخيك ” ينعتان ” الذي ” بالمعرفة وما قاربها . قال النحاس : وهذا محال عند البصريين ; لأنه نعت للاسم قبل أن يتم ، والمعنى عندهم : على المحسن .\nشرح ابن عقيل: ذهب الكوفيون إلى أنه يجوز حذف العائد المرفوع بالابتداء مطلقا، أي سواء أكان الموصول أيا أم غيره، وسواء أطالت الصلة أم لم تطل، وذهب البصريون إلى جواز حذف هذا العائد إذا كان الموصول أيا مطلقا، فإن كان الموصول غير أي لم يجيزوا الحذف إلا بشرط طول الصلة، فالخلاف بين الفريقين منحصر فيما إذا لم تطل الصلة وكان الموصول غير أي، فأما الكوفيون فاستدلوا بالسماع، فمن ذلك قراءة يحيى بن يعمر: (تماما على الذي أحسن) قالوا: التقدير على الذي هو أحسن، ومن ذلك قراءة مالك ابن دينار وابن السماك: (إن الله لا يستحيي أن يضرب مثلا ما بعوضة فما فوقها) قالوا: التقدير: مثلا الذي هو بعوضة فما فوقها، ومن ذلك قول الشاعر: لا تنو إلا الذي خير، فما شقيت * إلا نفوس الألى للشر ناوونا قالوا: التقدير لا تنو إلا الذي هو خير، ومن ذلك قول الآخر: من يعن بالحمد لم ينطق بما سفه ولا يحد عن سبيل المجد والكرم قالوا: تقدير هذا البيت: من يعن بالحمد لم ينطق بالذي هو سفه، ومن ذلك قول عدي بن زيد العبادي: لم أر مثل الفتيان في غبن * الأيام يدرون ما عواقبها قالوا: ما موصولة، والتقدير: يدرون الذي هو عواقبها. وبعض هذه الشواهد يحتمل وجوها من الاعراب غير الذي ذكروه، فمن ذلك أن ” ما ” في الآية الثانية يجوز أن تكون زائدة، وبعوضة خبر مبتدأ محذوف، ومن ذلك أن ” ما ” في بيت عدي بن زيد يحتمل أن تكون استفهامية مبتدأ، وما بعدها خبر، والجملة في محل نصب مفعول به ليدرون، وقد علق عنها لأنها مصدرة بالاستفهام، والكلام يطول إذا نحن تعرضنا لكل واحد من هذه الشواهد، فلنجتزئ لك بالإشارة.\n\n\n\nD.4.5 Use of ما for intelligent beings and من for non-intelligent beings\nFrom شرح ابن عقيل على ألفية ابن مالك ت: محمد محيي الدين عبد الحميد 1/147, footnotes\n\n(١) تستعمل ” ما ” في العاقل في ثلاثة مواضع، الاول: أن يختلط العاقل مع غير العاقل نحو قوله تعالى: (يسبح لله ما في السموات وما في الارض) فإن ما يتناول ما فيهما من إنس وملك وجن وحيوان وجماد، بدليل قوله: (وإن من شئ إلا يسبح بحمده) والموضع الثاني: أن يكون أمره مبهما على المتكلم، كقولك - وقد رأيت شبحا من بعيد -: انظر ما ظهر لي، وليس منه قوله تعالى: (إذ قالت امرأة عمران رب إني نذرت لك ما في بطني محررا) لان إبهام ذكورته وأنوثته لا يخرجه عن العقل، بل استعمال ” ما ” هنا في ما لا يعقل لان الحمل ملحق بالجماد، والموضع الثالث: أن يكون المراد صفات من يعقل، كقوله تعالى (فانكحوا ما طاب لكم) وهذا الموضع هو الذي ذكره الشارح بالمثال الاول من غير بيان.\n(٢) تستعمل ” من ” في غير العاقل في ثلاثة مواضع، الاول: أن يقترن غير العاقل مع من يعقل في عموم فصل بمن الجارة، نحو قوله تعالى: (فمنهم من يمشي على بطنه، ومنهم من يمشي على رجلين، ومنهم من يمشي على أربع) ومن المستعملة فيما لا يعقل مجاز مرسل علاقته المجاورة في هذا الموضع، والموضع الثاني: أن يشبه غير العاقل بالعاقل فيستعار له لفظه، نحو قوله تعالى: (من لا يستجيب له تعالى) وقول الشاعر أسرب القطا هل من يعير جناحه وهو الذي استشهد به المؤلف فيما يلي، وسنذكر معه نظائره، واستعمال من فيما لا يعقل حينئذ استعارة، لان العلاقة المشابهة، والموضع الثالث: أن يختلط من يعقل بما لا يعقل نحو قول الله تعالى: (ولله يسجد من في السموات ومن في الارض) واستعمال من فيما لا يعقل - في هذا الموضع - من باب التغليب، واعلم أن الاصل تغليب من يعقل على ما لا يعقل، وقد يغلب ما لا يعقل على من يعقل، لنكتة، وهذه النكت تختلف باختلاف الاحوال والمقامات.\n\n\n\nD.4.6 أيّ followed by شاء\nI have found some narrations where أيّ is followed by the verb شاء. For example,\nفَلْتَدْخُلْ مِنْ أَيِّ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ شَاءَتْ\nhttps://sunnah.com/mishkat:3254\nفُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةُ يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاءَ\nhttps://sunnah.com/muslim:234a\nفَخُذْ بِيَدِ أَيِّهِمَا شِئْتَ\nhttps://sunnah.com/abudawud:2277\nThe question is whether أيّ in these examples is موصولة\nحنين محمد عبد has a thesis entitled (أيٌّ) في اللغة العربية - دراسة نحوية under which some similar examples are filed under a category أي التعميمية.\nI’m not convinced…\nI find a similarity between these examples and the āyahs:\nمن كان يريد العاجلة عجلنا له فيها ما نشاء لمن نريد\nhttps://quran.com/17/18\nand\nنَرْفَعُ دَرَجَـٰتٍۢ مَّن نَّشَآءُ\nhttps://quran.com/12/76\nIn one reading درجات is a مضاف.\nAs far as I can see, مَنْ has been analyzed as موصولة in these verses. As to their صلة and عائد it has been generally menioned that the مفعول به for verbs like شاء is often deleted. But usually this is in a conditional context:\nFrom معاني النحو:\n\nويكثر ذلك في فعل المشيئة أو الإرادة أو نحوهما إذا وقع فعل شرط فإن الجواب يدل عليه ويبينه، نحو قوله تعالى: وَلَوْ شاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا، أي: ولو شاء الله ألا يقتتلوا أو عدم اقتتالهم ما اقتتلوا. فإنه لما قيل: «ولو شاء» علم السامع أن هناك شيئا تعلقت المشيئة الإلهية به لكنه خفيّ مبهم، فلما جيء بجواب الشرط صار بينا واضحا يقع في النفس.\nومثله قوله تعالى: وَلَوْ شاءَ لَهَداكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ، أي: لو شاء هدايتكم لهداكم أجمعين. وقوله تعالى: وَلَوْ شِئْنا لَآتَيْنا كُلَّ نَفْسٍ هُداها، أي: ولو شئنا هداية النفوس لآتينا كل نفس هداها.\n\nFrom دلائل الإعجاز للجرجاني:\n\nلَوْ شِئْتَ لَمْ تُفْسِدْ سَمَاحَةَ حَاتِمٍ كَرَمًا وَلَمْ تَهْدِمْ مَآثِرَ خَالِدِ\nالْأَصْلُ لَا مَحَالَةَ: لَوْ شِئْتَ أَنْ لَا تُفْسِدَ سَمَاحَةَ حَاتِمٍ لَمْ تُفْسِدْهَا ، ثُمَّ حَذَفَ ذَلِكَ مَنِ الْأَوَّلِ اسْتِغْنَاءً بِدَلَالَتِهِ فِي الثَّانِي عَلَيْهِ . ثُمَّ هُوَ عَلَى مَا تَرَاهُ وَتَعْلَمُهُ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ وَالْغَرَابَةِ وَهُوَ عَلَى مَا ذَكَرْتُ لَكَ مِنْ أَنَّ الْوَاجِبَ فِي حُكْمِ الْبَلَاغَةِ أَنْ لَا يُنْطَقَ بِالْمَحْذُوفِ وَلَا يَظْهَرُ إِلَى اللَّفْظِ . فَلَيْسَ يَخْفَى أَنَّكَ لَوْ رَجَعْتَ فِيهِ إِلَى مَا هُوَ أَصْلُهُ فَقُلْتَ : ” لَوْ شِئْتَ أَنْ لَا تُفْسِدَ سَمَاحَةَ حَاتِمٍ لَمْ تُفْسِدْهَا ” صِرْتَ إِلَى كَلَامٍ غَثٍّ، وَإِلَى شَيْءٍ يَمُجُّهُ السَّمْعُ وَتَعَافُهُ النَّفْسُ . وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ فِي الْبَيَانِ، [ ص: 164 ] إِذَا وَرَدَ بَعْدَ الْإِبْهَامِ وَبَعْدَ التَّحْرِيكِ لَهُ أَبَدًا لُطْفًا وَنُبْلًا لَا يَكُونُ إِذَا لَمْ يَتَقَدَّمْ مَا يُحَرِّكُ.\nوَأَنْتَ إِذَا قُلْتَ : ” لَوْ شِئْتَ ” عَلِمَ السَّامِعُ أَنَّكَ قَدْ عَلَّقْتَ هَذِهِ الْمَشِيئَةَ فِي الْمَعْنَى بِشَيْءٍ، فَهُوَ يَضَعُ فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّ هَهُنَا شَيْئًا تَقْتَضِي مَشِيئَتُهُ لَهُ أَنْ يَكُونَ أَوْ أَنْ لَا يَكُونَ . فَإِذَا قُلْتَ : ” لَمْ تُفْسِدْ سَمَاحَةَ حَاتِمٍ ” عَرَفَ ذَلِكَ الشَّيْءَ.\nوَمَجِيءُ ” الْمَشِيئَةِ ” بَعْدَ ” لَوْ ” وَبَعْدَ حُرُوفِ الْجَزَاءِ هَكَذَا مَوْقُوفَةً غَيْرَ مُعَدَّاةٍ إِلَى شَيْءٍ، كَثِيرٌ شَائِعٌ كَقَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى : « وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى الْهُدَى » [ سُورَةِ الْأَنْعَامِ :35 ] « وَلَوْ شَاءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ » [ سُورَةِ النَّحْلِ :9 ] . وَالتَّقْدِيرُ فِي ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ عَلَى مَا ذَكَرْتُ، فَالْأَصْلُ : لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ أَنْ يَجْمَعَهُمْ عَلَى الْهُدَى لَجَمَعَهُمْ - وَلَوْ شَاءَ أَنْ يَهْدِيَكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ لَهَدَاكُمْ - إِلَّا أَنَّ الْبَلَاغَةَ فِي أَنْ يُجَاءَ بِهِ كَذَلِكَ مَحْذُوفًا .\n\nMy examples are not in a conditional context but could they be analyzed as أي الموصولة with its صلة in the deleted مفعول به of شاء?\nFor example:\nفَلْتَدْخُلْ مِنْ أَيِّ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ شَاءَتْ أن تدخل منه\n\n\nD.4.7 The violence of the grammarians\nI wish I could directly use examples from the classical grammarians. But consider this gem from كتاب سيبويه:\nوزعم الخليل أن أيهم إنما وقع في قولهم: اضرب أيهم أفضل على أنه حكاية\nEven the most excellent of them they would beat!\nand how about this from ابن عقيل:\nيعجبني أيهم ضربته في داره\nA man was not safe from the grammarians even in his own house, and even when he was someone they liked!\nAnd when tired from all the beatings they were dishing out, they would suffice with يعجبني and مررت بـ sentences which grow repetitious.\nI’m just complaining…",

Consider the example:\nأَتَدْرِي أَيَّ كِتَابٍ قَرَأَ؟\nDo you know which book he read?\nأَيّ is a question noun in the propped-state because it is the direct doee of the verb قَرَأَ. It can’t be a connected noun because أَيَّ كِتَابٍ is indefinite and connected nouns are always considered definite.\nSee also these excerpts:\nFrom the tafsīr of وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ

أقوال:\nأحدها: قول الخليل أنه مبتدأ وأشد خبره ولم يعمل لننزعن فيه لأنه محكي والتقدير الذي يقال فيه: ﴿أيُّهم أشَدُّ عَلى الرَّحْمَنِ عِتِيًّا﴾ وعلى هذا فـ (أي) استفهامية.\nالثاني: قول يونس أنه رفع على جهة التعليق للفعل السابق كما لو قلت علمت أنه أخوك فعلق الفعل عن الفعل كما تعلق أفعال القلوب.\nالثالث: قول سيبويه إن (أي) هنا موصولة مبنية على الضم والمسوغ لبنائها حذف صدر صلتها، وعنده أصل الكلام أيهم هو أشد فلما حذف صدر الصلة بنيت على الضم تشبيها لها بالغايات التي قد حذفت مضافاتها ك قبل وبعد وعلى كل واحد من الأقوال إشكالات نذكرها ثم نبين الصحيح إن شاء الله.\nفأما قول الخليل: فقيل يلزمه ستة أمور:\nالأول حذف الموصوف.\nالثاني: حذف الصلة.\nالثالث: حذف العائد لأن تقديره الذي يقال لهم إنهم أشد وهذا لا عهد لنا فيه باللغة.\nوأما ما يحذف من القول فإنه إنما يكون قولا مجردا عن كونه صلة لموصول نحو قوله: ﴿والمَلائِكَةُ باسِطُو أيْدِيهِمْ أخْرِجُوا أنْفُسَكُمُ﴾ أي يقولون أو قائلين ومثله: ﴿والَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أوْلِياءَ ما نَعْبُدُهم إلاّ لِيُقَرِّبُونا إلى اللَّهِ زُلْفى﴾\nالرابع: أنه إذا قدر المحذوف هكذا لم يستقم الكلام فإنه يصير ﴿لَنَنْزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ﴾ الذين يقال فيهم ﴿أيُّهم أشَدُّ﴾\nوهذا فاسد فإن ذلك المنزوع لا يقال فيه: ﴿أيُّهم أشَدُّ﴾ بل هو نفسه أشد أو من أشد الشيعة على الرحمن فلا يقع عليه الاستفهام بعد نزعه فتأمله.\nالخامس: أن الاستفهام لا يقع إلا بعد أفعال العلم والقول على الحكاية ولا يقع بعد غيره من الأفعال تقول علمت أزيد عندك أم عمرو ولو قلت ضربت أزيد أم عمرو لم يجز وننزعن ليس من أفعال العلم\nفإذا قلت: ضربت أيهم قام. لم تكن إلا موصولة ولا يصح أن يقال ضربت الذي يقال فيه أيهم قام، وإنما توهم مثل ذلك لكون اللفظ صالحا لجهة أخرى مستقيمة فيتوهم متوهم أن حمله على الجهة الأخرى يستقيم والذي يدل عليه أنه لو قدرت موضعه استفهاما صريحا ليس له جهة أخرى لم يجز\nفإذا قلت: ضرب أزيد عندك أم عمرو. لم يجز بخلاف ضرب أيهم عندك.\nفلو كان أيهم استفهاما لجاز الكلام مع الاستفهام الذي بمعناهما وإنما لم يقع الاستفهام إلا بعد أفعال العلم والقول أما القول فلأنه يحكي به كل جملة خبرية كانت أو إنشائية، وأما أفعال العلم فإنما وقع بعدها الاستفهام لكون الاستفهام مستعلما به فكأنك إذا قلت: أزيد عندك أم عمرو كان معناه أعلمني، وإذا قلت: علمت أزيد عندك أم عمرو.\nكان معناه علمت ما يطلب استعلامه فلهذا صح وقوع الاستفهام بعد العلم لأنه استعلام ثم حمل الحسبان والظن عليهما لكونهما من بابه ووجه آخر وهو كثرة استعمال أفعال العلم فجعل شأن ليس لغيرها.\nالسادس: أن هذا الحذف الذي قدره في الآية حذف لا يدل عليه سياق فهو مجهول الوضع وكل حذف كان بهذه المنزلة كان تقديره من باب علم الغيب وأما قول يونس بن حبيب فإشكاله ظاهر فإن التعليق إنما يكون في أفعال القلوب نحو العلم والظن والحسبان دون غيرها.\nولا يجوز أن تقول ضربت أيهم قام على أن تكون (أيهم) استفهاما وقد علق الفعل عن العمل فيه وأما قول سيبويه فإشكاله أنه بناء خارج عن النظائر ولم يوجد في اللغة شاهد له قال السهيلي ما ذكره سيبويه لو استشهد عليه بشاهد من نظم أو نثر أو وجدنا بعده في كلام فصيح شاهدا له لم نعدل به قولا ولا رأينا لغيره عنه طولا ولكنا لم نجز ما بين لمخالفته غيره لا سيما مثل هذه المخالفة فإنا لا نسلم أنه حذف من الكلام شيء وإن قال: إنه حذف ولا بد والتقدير أيهم هو أخوك فيقال: لم يبنوا في النكرة فيقولون مررت برجل أخوك أو رأيت رجلا أبوك أي هو أخوك وأبوك ولم خصوا أيا هذا دون سائر الأسماء أن يحذف من صلته ثم يبنى للحذف ومتى وجدنا شيئا من الجملة يحذف ثم يبنى الموصوف بالجملة من أجل ذلك الحذف وذلك الحذف لا نجعله متضمنا لمعنى الحرف ولا مضارعا له وهذه علة البناء وقد عدمت في أي قال والمختار قول الخليل ولكنه يحتاج إلى شرح وذلك أنه لم يرد بالحكاية ما يسبق إلى الفهم من تقدير معنى القول ولكنه أراد حكاية لفظ الاستفهام الذي هو أصل في أي كما يحكيه بعد العلم إذا قلت قد علمت من أخوك وأقام زيد أم قعد فقد تركت الكلام على حاله قبل دخول الفعل لبقاء معنى الاختصاص والتعيين في أي الذي كان موجودا فيها وهي استفهام لأن ذلك المعنى هو الذي وضعت له استفهاما كانت أو خبرا كما حكوا لفظ النداء في قولهم اللهم اغفر لي أيها الرجل وارحمنا أيتها العصابة فنحكي لفظ هذا إشعارا بالتعيين والاختصاص الموجود في حال النداء لوجود معنى الاختصاص والتعيين فيه قال وقول يونس: إن الفعل ملغي حق وإن لم يكن من أفعال القلب وعلة إلغائه ما قدمناه من حكاية لفظ الاستفهام للاختصاص فإذا أتممت العلة وقلت ضربت أيهم أخوك. زالت مضارعة الاستفهام وغلب فيه معنى الخبر لوجود الصلة التامة بعده\nقال وأما قوله تعالى: ﴿وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أيَّ مُنْقَلَبٍ يَنْقَلِبُونَ﴾ وإجماعهم على أنها منصوبة بـ ﴿ينقلبون﴾ لا بـ ﴿سيعلم﴾ وقد كان يتصور فيها أن تكون منصوبة بـ سيعلم على جهة الاستفهام ولكن تكون موصولة والجملة صلتها والعائد محذوف ولكن منع من هذا أصل أصلناه ودليل أقمناه على أن الاسم الموصول إذا عني به المصدر ووصل بفعل مشتق من ذلك المصدر لم يجز لعدم الفائدة المطلوبة من الصلة وهي إيضاح الموصول وتبيينه والمصدر لا يوضح فعله المشتق من لفظه لأنه كأنه هو لفظا ومعنى إلا في المختلف الأنواع كما تقدم قال ووجه آخر أقوى من هذا وهو أن أيا لا تكون بمعنى الذي حتى تضاف إلى معرفة فتقول لقيت أيهم في الدار إذ من المحال أن يكون بمعنى الذي وهو نكرة والذي لا ينكر وهذا أصل يبنى عليه في (أي).\n\nFrom معانى القآن للفراء for the tafsīr of [2:69]:\n\nفأعملْ في ” ما ” ” وأي ” الفعلَ الذي بعدَهما، ولا تُعمِل الذي قبلهما إذا كان مُشتقّاً من العِلْم ؛ كقولك : ما أعلم أَيُّهم قال ذاك، ولا أعلمنّ أَيُّهم قال ذاك، وما أدرِى أَيَّهم ضربت، فهو في العِلِم والإخبار والإنْباء وما أشبهها على ما وصفتُ لك. منه قول الله تبارك وتعالى :﴿ وَما أَدْرَاكَ ماهِيَهْ ﴾ ﴿ وَما أَدْرَاكَ ما يَوْمُ الدَّينِ ﴾ ” ما ” الثانية رفعٌ، فرفعتَها بيوم ؛ كقولك : ما أدراك أي شيء يومُ الدّين، وكذلك قول الله تبارك وتعالى :﴿ لِنَعْلَمَ أي الْحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَى ﴾ رفعتَه بأَحْصَى، وتقول إذا كان الفعل واقعا على أي : ما أدرى أَيَّهم ضربت. وإنما امتنعت من أن تُوقع على أي الفعل الذي قبلها من العلم وأشباهه ؛ لأنك تجِدُ الفعلَ غيرَ واقع على أي في المعنى ؛ ألا ترى أنك إذا قلت : اذْهَبْ فاعلم أيُّهما قام أنك تسأل غيرهما عن حالهما فتجد الفعل واقعا على الذي أعلمك، كما أنك تقول : سل أيُّهُمْ قام، والمعنى : سل الناس أيُّهُمْ قام. ولو أوقعت الفعل على ” أي ” فقلت : اسأل أيَّهُمْ قام لكنت كأنك تضمر أيّاً مرّة أخرى ؛ لأنك تقول : سل زيدا أيُّهُمْ قام، فإذا أوقعت الفعل على زيد فقد جاءت ” أي ” بعده. فكذلك ” أي ” إذا أوقعت عليها الفعل خرجت من معنى الاستفهام، وذلك إن أردته، جائز، تقول : لأضْرِبَنَّ أيَّهُم يقول ذاك ؛ لأنّ الضرب لا يقع على [ اسم ثم يأتي بعد ذلك استفهام، وذلك لأن الضرب لا يقع على ] اثنين، وأنتَ تقول في المسألة : سل عبد الله عن كذا، كأنك قلت : سله عن كذا، ولا يجوز ضربت عبد الله كذا وكذا إلا أن تريد صفة الضرب، فأما الأسماء فلا. وقول الله :﴿ ثُمَّ لَنَنْزِعَنّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعةٍ أيُّهُم أشَدُّ على الرّحْمَنِ عِتيّاً ﴾ من نصب أيّاً أوقع عليها النزع وليس باستفهام، كأنه قال : ثم لنستخرجن العاتيَ الذي هو أشد. وفيها وجهان من الرفع ؛ أحدهما أن تجعل الفعل مكتفيا بِمن في الوقوع عليها، كما تقول : قد قتلنا من كل قوم، وأصبنا من كل طعام، ثم تستأنف أيّاً فترفعها بالذي بعدها، كما قال جلّ وعزّ :﴿ يَبْتَغُونَ إلى رَبِّهِمُ الْوَسِيلَةَ أيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ ﴾ أي ينظرون أيُّهُم أقرب. ومثله ﴿ يُلْقُونَ أقْلاَمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ ﴾. وأما الوجه، الآخر فإن في قوله تعالى :﴿ ثم لَنَنْزِعَنّ مِنْ كلِّ شِيعَةٍ ﴾ لننزعن من الذين تشايعوا على هذا، ينظرون بالتشايع أيهم أشدّ وأخبث، وأيهم أشدّ على الرحمن عِتيّاً، والشيعة ويتشايعون سواء في المعنى. وفيه وجه ثالث من الرفع أن تجعل ﴿ ثُمّ لَننْزِعَنَّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ ﴾ بالنداء ؛ أي لننادين ﴿ أيُّهُمْ أشدُّ على الرّحْمانِ عِتيّاً ﴾ وليس هذا الوجه يريدون. ومثله مما تعرفه به قوله :﴿ أفَلَمْ يَيْأَسِ الَّذِيِنَ آمنَوُا أَنْ لَوْ يشاء اللَّهُ لهَدَى الناس جَميعاً ﴾ فقال بعض المفسرين ﴿ أَفَلَمْ يَيْأَسِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ﴾ : ألم يعلم، والمعنى - والله أعلم - أفلم ييأسوا علما بأن الله لو شاء لهدى الناس جميعا. وكذلك ” لَنَنْزِعَنّ ” يقول يريد ننزعهم بالنداء.\n\n\n\nD.5.3 \nWright 2/313C states:\n\nAs interrogatives, مَنْ and مَا are construed with the masculine singular of a verb, but occasionally admit of the feminine when the predicate is of the feminine gender; as مَنْ كَانَتْ أُمَّكَ who was your mother?\n\nFrom البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for the tafsīr of فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثۡنَتَیۡنِ [4:176]:\n\n… مَن صُرِّحَ بِها ولَها لَفْظٌ ومَعْنًى. فَمَن أنَّثَ راعى المَعْنى، لِأنَّ التَّقْدِيرَ: أيَّةُ أُمٍّ كانَتْ أُمَّكَ. ومَدْلُولُ الخَبَرِ في هَذا مُخالِفٌ لِمَدْلُولِ الِاسْمِ، بِخِلافِ الآيَةِ، فَإنَّ المَدْلُولَيْنِ واحِدٌ، ولَمْ يُؤَنَّثْ في مَن كانَتْ أُمَّكَ لِتَأْنِيثِ الخَبَرِ، إنَّما أُنِّثَ مُراعاةً لِمَعْنى مَن إذْ أرادَ بِها مُؤَنَّثًا. ألا تَرى أنَّكَ تَقُولُ: مَن قامَتْ فَتُؤَنَّثُ مُراعاةً لِلْمَعْنى إذا أرَدْتَ السُّؤالَ عَنْ مُؤَنَّثٍ، ولا خَبَرَ هُنا فَيُؤَنَّثُ قامَتْ لِأجْلِهِ\n\nFrom البحر المحيط لأبي حيان for the tafsīr of ثُمَّ لَمۡ تَكُن فِتۡنَتُهُمۡ [6:23]:\n\n[وأمّا مَن كانَتْ أُمَّكَ، فَإنَّهُ حَمَلَ اسْمَ كانَ عَلى مَعْنى (مَن)؛ لِأنَّ مَن لَها لَفْظٌ مُفْرَدٌ، ولَها مَعْنًى بِحَسَبِ ما تُرِيدُ مِن إفْرادٍ وتَثْنِيَةٍ وجَمْعٍ وتَذْكِيرٍ وتَأْنِيثٍ، ولَيْسَ الحَمْلُ عَلى المَعْنى لِمُراعاةِ الخَبَرِ، ألا تَرى أنَّهُ يَجِيءُ حَيْثُ لا خَبَرَ ؟ نَحْوَ ومِنهم مَن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إلَيْكَ. و(تَكُنْ)

وكَأنَّكَ قُلْتَ: أيَّةُ امْرَأةٍ كانَتْ أُمَّكَ",
