So too is much of its scholarly literature. However, there is a multitude of Muslims for whom Arabic is not a native language, yet who are familiar enough with English to study textbooks written in this language. The goal of this book is to help them learn Arabic at a beginner’s level so that, together with a study of the appropriate expositional texts, they are one step closer to understanding the primary texts in their original language. We hope that this will, if Allāh wills, make them feel more connected to the primary texts and their teachings. Furthermore, they can be empowered to study the vast body of Arabic Islāmic literature. This book is a teaching grammar and not a reference grammar. So, in the initial chapters, topics are presented sequentially at only a basic level, without treating them exhaustively, before moving on to the next topic. Furthermore, since this is a beginner’s textbook, only the more common usages are explained. We have also aimed to make this a self-instruction textbook so that a diligent student should, if Allāh wills, be able to study it without an instructor. The target learner is someone who has not been exposed to grammatical terminology like inflection, case, mood, etc. While terminology is necessary for a rigorous non-immersive learning of language, we have tried to steer away from Latin-based terms like accusative and jussive. Such terms, when first encountered by an uninitiated learner, may deter from proceeding further. (Learning a language can be hard enough without getting the feeling that your grammar book is accusing you of something!) So we have in some places translated the meaning of Arabic grammar terms to English. In other places, we have used established English grammar terms where the terms are basic enough. We have even, in places, invented terms where we deemed appropriate. The drawback to this non-standard approach, however, is that the student may not be able to immediately relate the terminology he has learned in this book to established terminology in other grammar textbooks. To remedy this to some extent, we provide a glossary in the appendix which maps the grammatical terminology used in this book to other, established, Latin-based and Arabic-based counterparts. It may also be appropriate to inform the reader that we chose to present a simplified version of Arabic grammar. As such, the grammar presented here may not be entirely consistent with the comprehensive and harmonious framework developed by the Arab grammarians. We chose this approach because we felt that exposing the beginner to complex grammatical details at this stage would be more of a hindrance than a help in learning the language.

We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allāh from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds. Whomever Allāh guides, no one can mislead. Whomever Allāh leads astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except Allāh. I also bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and messenger. May the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon the Prophet Muḥammad, his family, his companions, and those who followed them with good conduct. 1.1 History of Arabic Allāh, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the Qurʾān 1400 years ago to the Prophet Muḥammad, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Qurʾān is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. We will call the Arabic of this pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic era as Classical Arabic. The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken by the different tribes and in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula. All languages change naturally over time. For example, English has changed to such a degree that the Old English language spoken 1400 years ago would be unintelligible to us today. So too did the Classical Arabic dialects begin to change. But as part of preserving His religion, Allāh preserved the Arabic language as well. This was by means of the efforts of scholars who recorded the Classical Arabic language of the time of the revelation. In the process of preserving Arabic, one particular variety became standardized and gained prevalence as a literary language over the other dialects of the Arabic of the early-Islāmic period. This Standard Arabic, in its early period after standardization, is called Classical Standard Arabic. The pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic Arabic dialects (of which Classical Standard Arabic is but a standardized variety) are then referred to, collectively, as pre-standard Classical Arabic. Classical Standard Arabic was used as the language of religious scholarship, science, and literature in the Islāmic world. As scholars developed new branches of religious and secular sciences, new terms and meanings were added to it that are termed post-classical. A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages and Arabicized, as needed by the different scientific disciplines. (Pre-Standard Classical Arabic itself had a few Arabicized foreign borrowings from neighboring languages.) These additions were, by and large, deliberate, done by scholars who were experts in their fields and also well versed in Classical Standard Arabic, and validated by subsequent generations of scholarly discourse. Besides these needed additions, the grammar and core language remained remarkably unchanged. While Standard Arabic was thus preserved from major change and was used for literary purposes, the language that was spoken by Arabs in their day-to-day lives continued to change over time from the pre-standard Classical Arabic dialects into the modern colloquial dialects. And so today, there exist two very distinct types of Arabic: the preserved Standard Arabic which is taught at schools and is primarily a written language, and the modern colloquial Arabic dialects which Arabs learn as their mother tongue and which are primarily only spoken and not written. Figure 1.1: Timeline of the development of Standard Arabic. In modern times, many new words and meanings have been added to Standard Arabic, often via translation from Western languages, to keep up with technological advancements and modern media. This modern development of Standard Arabic is called Modern Standard Arabic. There are also a small amount of words, meanings, and grammatical usages, which existed in Classical Arabic, but which are deemed archaic, and are therefore largely unused, in Modern Standard Arabic. Figure 1.1 (above) depicts this historical development of Standard Arabic. 1.2 Scope of this book In this book, we will study Standard Arabic. We will focus on the pre-modern language. If Allāh wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the Qurʾān, the Ḥadīt͡h, and Islāmic literature. If your goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic, then this book may still be of help because the core language and the grammar are essentially the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on the modern language. This book does not touch at all upon the modern colloquial dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today. 1.3 How to study from this book We will start with the Arabic script and present in each chapter a new concept of Arabic grammar, together with examples. We will also give vocabulary for you to memorize and have chapter exercises. Unfortunately, some of the sentences we present, both as examples and as chapter exercises, because of their construction and subject matter, may seem of dubious usefulness to a learner wanting to learn practical usage. We ask that you overlook this and bear with us as we try to reinforce grammatical concepts. In answering the exercises, we strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and write down the answers on paper with a pen. We strongly recommend that you not: answer the exercises verbally without writing them down, look up the answers before attempting to write the answer yourself, look up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them, proceed to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises. Be aware that while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a proficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by oneself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts independently. You may also find yourself having to go back a few chapters every once in a while and revising the concepts therein. This is very normal and not a cause for any alarm. It may also prove beneficial to re-do the exercises of that chapter when this occurs.

In this word, the yāʾ ي joins to the tāʾ marbūṭah ة. When unseated hamzah is followed by an ʾalif: ءا, the combination of hamzah and ʾalif is usually written as آ as a convention. Examples: آمَنَ ʾāmana, ظَمْآن ḍ͡hamʾān, شَنَآن s͡hanaʾān. However, when the ʾalif is a suffix or part of a suffix, or the hamzah is doubled, or there is an ʾalif before the hamzah then we will write ءا, not آ. Examples: شَيْءَانِ s͡hayʾāni, سَءَّال saʾʾāl, قِرَاءَات qirāʾāt. When hamzah is seated on ʾalif, if it has an kasrah, it is written below the ʾalif: إِ. Otherwise, it is written above the ʾalif: أَ, أُ, أْ. When hamzah is seated on yāʾ ئ the dots of the yāʾ are no longer written. Here’s how it will appear in different positions: Isolated End Middle Beginnning ئ ـئ ـئـ ئـ Note that hamzah is seated on yāʾ in the middle position ـئـ is different from unseated hamzah between two joining letters ـءـ. So how do we know when to write hamzah unseated and when seated? And how do we choose between its three different seats? There are a set of rules that we need to follow in order to correctly write hamzah. Before we give the rules we will first present the underlying principle behind the rules. A.2 Rules for determining the seat of hamzah A.2.1 Separate main word from prefixes and suffixes In order to determine the seat of hamzah for a words, we must first separate the main word from any prefixes and suffixes. We will determine the seat of hamzah for the main word first. Hamzah can occur in three positions in the main word: At the beginning of the word In the middle of the word At the end of the word We will treat each of these positions below. A.2.1.1 At the beginning of the word When hamzah occurs in the beginning of a word, then: If the hamzah carries a long-ā vowel, it is written unseated followed by an ʾalif and written as آ, for example آمَنَ ʾāmana. If the hamzah carries any other vowel, it is written seated on an ʾalif, and is marked with the appropriated vowel mark, for example أَسْلَمَ ʾaslama, أُرِيدُ ʾurīdu, إِسْلَام ʾislām, إِيمَان ʾīmān, أُوخِذَ ʾūk͡hid͡ha. A.2.1.2 In the middle of the word The most general case is when hamzah is in the middle of a word. Arabic has three short vowels, three long vowels, two diphthongs, and a sukūn. Each of these has an order of precedence and a hamzah seat. Precedence Vowel Seat 1. ī/ay ء 2. i ئ 3. ū/aw ء 4. u ؤ 5. ā ء 6. a أ 7. ◌ْ ء Main rule: Disregard any doubling mark ◌ّ and consider the vowel on the consonant before the hamzah and the shortened vowel on the hamzah itself. Determine which of the two vowels wins by being higher in precedence in the above table. The winning vowel’s seat will be the seat of the hamzah. Sub-rule: If the main rule determines that hamzah is to be seated on ʾalif, and there is a long ā vowel on the hamzah using an ʾalif, then hamzah shall be unseated. And the combination of ءَا will usually be written as آ. Examples: Word Vowel on consonant before hamzah Shortened vowel on hamzah Winning vowel Seated hamzah هَيْءَة hayʾah ay a ay ء خَطِيءَة k͡haṭīʾah ī a ī ء اسْتِيءَاس ʾistīʾās ī a ī ء (Exception: ءَا is not written as آ when the preceding vowel is ī.) تَوْءَم tawʾam aw a aw ء سَائِل sāʾil ā i i ئ تَسَاؤُل tasāʾul ā u u ؤ تَسَاءَلَ tasāʾala ā a ā ء قِرَاءَات qirāʾāt ā a ā ء مَسْؤُول masʾūl ◌ْ u u ؤ تَرْئِيس tarʾīs ◌ْ i i ئ مِرْآة mirʾāh ◌ْ a a ء (Using sub-rule.) ظَمْآن ḍ͡hamʾān ◌ْ a a ء (Using sub-rule.) مَسْأَلَة masʾalah ◌ْ a a أ الْمَرْأَة almarʾah ◌ْ a a أ بِئْسَ biʾsa i ◌ْ i ئ سُؤْلَکَ suʾlaka u ◌ْ u ؤ کَأْس kaʾs a ◌ْ a أ سُئِلَ suʾila u i i ئ يَئِسَ yaʾisa a i i ئ رَئِيس raʾīs a i i ئ سُؤَال suʾāl u a u ؤ رُؤُوس ruʾūs u u u ؤ لُؤَيّ luʾayy u a u ؤ شَنَآن s͡hanaʾān a a a ء (Using sub-rule.) سَأَلَ saʾala a a a أ رَأَىٰ raʾā a a a أ رَأَّسَ raʾʾasa a a a أ يُرَئِّسُ yuraʾʾisu a i i ئ رُئِّسَ ruʾʾisa u i i ئ تَفَؤُّل tafaʾʾul a u u ؤ سَءَّال saʾʾāl a a a ء (Using sub-rule.) لَءَّال laʾʾāl a a a ء (Using sub-rule.) A.2.1.3 At the end of the word When hamzah occurs at the end of a word, disregard the vowel on hamzah itself, and consider only the vowel on preceding consonant. Plug it into the table as above, and determine to determine the seat of hamzah. Word Vowel on consonant before hamzah Seated hamzah دُعَاءُ duɛāʾu ā ء سُوءُ sūʾu ū ء جِيءَ jīʾa ī ء ضَوْءَ ḍawʾa aw ء شَيْءَ s͡hayʾa ay ء بُطْءُ buṭʾu ◌ْ ء عِبْءُ ɛibʾu ◌ْ ء شَطْءُ s͡haṭʾu ◌ْ ء يُهَدِّئُ yuhaddiʾu i ئ سَيِّئُ sayyiʾu i ئ بَطُؤَ baṭuʾa u ؤ يَهْدَأُ yahdaʾu a أ مُبْتَدَإِ mubtadaʾi a إ The exception to this rule is when the previous letter is a doubled wāw with an ḍammah. In this case the hamzah will again be unseated. Example تَبَوُّءُ tabawwuʾu. Note also that مُبْتَدَإِ mubtadaʾi can be written with the hamzah below the ʾalif because of the i-mark on the hamzah. But it is also common to write it as مُبْتَدَأ mubtadaʾ, especially when the hamzah is unvoweled. A.2.2 Prefixes and suffixes A.2.2.1 Prefixes If hamzah is in the beginning of a word, adding a prefix to the word will not alter the writing of the hamzah. Examples: لِ + أُسْتَاذِ = لِأُسْتَاذِ الْ + آخِرَة = الْآخِرَة A.2.2.2 Suffixes If hamzah is at the end of a word, adding a suffix to the word can, in general, alter the writing of the hamzah. Hamzah is now, generally, treated as if it is in the middle of the word, and the rules for hamzah in the middle of a word apply. Examples: Word Vowel on consonant before hamzah Shortened vowel on hamzah Winning vowel Seated hamzah بَرِيءُونَ barīʾūna ī u ī ء بَرِيءَانِ barīʾāni ī a ī ء بَرِيءِينَ barīʾīna ī i ī ء بَرِيءَيْنِ barīʾayni ī a ī ء شَيْءُهُ s͡hayʾuhu ay u ay ء شَيْءَهُ s͡hayʾahu ay a ay ء شَيْءِهِ s͡hayʾihi ay i ay ء شَيْءَانِ s͡hayʾāni ay a ay ء شَيْءَيْنِ s͡hayʾayni ay a ay ء مَجِيءُهُ majīʾuhu ī u ī ء مَجِيءَهُ majīʾahu ī a ī ء مَجِيءِهِ majīʾihi ī i ī ء سُوئِهِ sūʾihi ū i i ئ ضَوْئِهِ ḍawʾihi aw i i ئ سُوءَهُ sūʾahu ū a ū ء سُوءَانِ sūʾāni ū a ū ء ضَوْءَهُ ḍawʾahu aw a aw ء ضَوْءَانِ ḍawʾāni aw a aw ء سُوءُهُ sūʾuhu ū u ū ء يَسُوءُونَ yasūʾūna ū u ū ء نُوآنٌ nūʾānun. ū a ū ء مُتَّکِئِينَ muttakiʾīna i i i ئ يُبَرِّئُونَ yubarriʾūna i u i ئ يُبَرَّؤُونَ yubarraʾūna a u u ؤ There are some exceptions: If the letter before the hamzah has a sukūn and is not wāw or yāʾ, then the hamzah will be written unseated. Examples: جُزْءَانِ juzʾāni عِبْءَانِ ɛibʾāni عِبْءَيْنِ ɛibʾayni بُطْءَهُ buṭʾahu بُطْءُهُ buṭʾuhu بُطْءِهِ buṭʾihi (انِ, يْنِ, هُ, and هِ are suffixes.) A.2.3 tanwīn on final hamzah tanwīn on a final hamzah does not affect the writing of the hamzah except in the case of tanwīn al-fat·ḥ. When writing tanwīn al-fat·ḥ on a hamzah at the end of a word: If there is an ʾalif before a unseated hamzah اء, then we don’t add a silent ʾalif when writing tanwīn al-fat·ḥ. For example دَاء becomes دَاءً dāʾan, not دَاءًا. Otherwise, we add the silent ʾalif after the hamzah so that the hamzah is now in the middle of the word with a suffix ʾalif after it. We now pretend that the hamzah has an fat·ḥah and that the ʾalif after it is a long-ā vowel. Then we go through the rules for writing hamzah in the middle of a word (given above) to determine how hamzah will be written. We then write the an-mark on the hamzah. Examples: مُبْتَدَأ becomes مُبْتَدَأٌ، مُبْتَدَءًا، مُبْتَدَإٍ مَلْجَأ becomes مَلْجَأٌ، مَلْجَءًا، مَلْجَإٍ جُزْء becomes جُزْءٌ، جُزْءًا، جُزْءٍ شَيْء becomes شَيْءٌ، شَيْءًا، شَيْءٍ A.2.4 Variants There are some historical and regional variants to the above rules. The main one is a variant of rule 2.b.ii above. In this variant, when the letter before hamzah has a sukūn, the hamzah is generally written unseated. So they write: مَسْءُول instead of مَسْؤُول أَسْءِلَة instead of أَسْئِلَة مَسْءَلَة instead of مَسْأَلَة However, this rule appears to be not consistently followed. For example, al-nas͡hʾah is generally always written النَّشْأَة never النَّشْءَة. A second variant is to avoid the repetition of vowel letters like و and ي. So they write: رُءُوس instead of رُؤُوس. رَءِيس instead of رَئِيس. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
