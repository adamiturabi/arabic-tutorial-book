<p>All praises are due to Allāh. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allāh from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds. Whomever Allāh guides, no one can mislead. Whomever Allāh leads astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except Allāh. I also bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and messenger.</p>
<p>May the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon the Prophet Muḥammad, his family, his companions, and those who followed them with good conduct.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> History of Arabic<a href="introduction.html#history-of-arabic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Allāh, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the Qurʾān 1400 years ago to the Prophet Muḥammad, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Qurʾān is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time.
The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allāh grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language.
We will call the Arabic of this pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic era as Classical Arabic.
The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken by the different tribes and in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula.</p>
<p>All languages change naturally over time. For example, English has changed to such a degree that the Old English language spoken 1400 years ago would be unintelligible to us today. So too did the Classical Arabic dialects begin to change. But as part of preserving His religion, Allāh preserved the Arabic language as well. This was by means of the efforts of scholars who recorded the Classical Arabic language of the time of the revelation.</p>
<p>In the process of preserving Arabic, one particular variety became standardized and gained prevalence as a literary language over the other dialects of the Arabic of the early-Islāmic period. This <em>Standard Arabic</em>, in its early period after standardization, is called Classical Standard Arabic.
<!--or simply Classical Arabic[^1]. -->
The pre-Islāmic and early Islāmic Arabic dialects (of which Classical Standard Arabic is but a standardized variety) are then referred to, collectively, as pre-standard Classical Arabic. Classical Standard Arabic was used as the language of religious scholarship, science, and literature in the Islāmic world. As scholars developed new branches of religious and secular sciences, new terms and meanings were added to it that are termed post-classical. A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages and Arabicized, as needed by the different scientific disciplines. (Pre-Standard Classical Arabic itself had a few Arabicized foreign borrowings from neighboring languages.) These additions were, by and large, deliberate, done by scholars who were experts in their fields and also well versed in Classical Standard Arabic, and validated by subsequent generations of scholarly discourse. Besides these needed additions, the grammar and core language remained remarkably unchanged.</p>
<!--
[^1]: This definition of the term _Classical Arabic_ is not universally accepted, and other authors may use it to also include the Arabic of the late pre-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic and early [#islAm]{.trn2}ic period.
-->
<!--Ahmad Al-Jallad, Damascus Psalm Fragment, p. 69-->
<p>While Standard Arabic was thus preserved from major change and was used for literary purposes, the language that was spoken by Arabs in their day-to-day lives continued to change over time from the pre-standard Classical Arabic dialects into the modern colloquial dialects. And so today, there exist two very distinct types of Arabic: the preserved Standard Arabic which is taught at schools and is primarily a written language, and the modern colloquial Arabic dialects which Arabs learn as their mother tongue and which are primarily only spoken and not written.</p>

<p>In modern times, many new words and meanings have been added to Standard Arabic, often via translation from Western languages, to keep up with technological advancements and modern media.
<!--However, it must be said that these additions have often been done by translators rather than scholars in the field, and have sometimes lacked the deliberation seen in the post-classical additions to Standard Arabic. -->
This modern development of Standard Arabic is called Modern Standard Arabic.
There are also a small amount of words, meanings, and grammatical usages, which existed in Classical Arabic, but which are deemed archaic, and are therefore largely unused, in Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
<p>Figure 1.1 (above) depicts this historical development of Standard Arabic.</p>

<p>In this book, we will study Standard Arabic. We will focus on the pre-modern language. If Allāh wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the Qurʾān, the Ḥadīt͡h, and Islāmic literature.</p>
<p>If your goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic, then this book may still be of help because the core language and the grammar are essentially the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on the modern language.</p>
<p>This book does not touch at all upon the modern colloquial dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.</p>

<p>We will start with the Arabic script and present in each chapter a new concept of Arabic grammar, together with examples. We will also give vocabulary for you to memorize and have chapter exercises. Unfortunately, some of the sentences we present, both as examples and as chapter exercises, because of their construction and subject matter, may seem of dubious usefulness to a learner wanting to learn practical usage. We ask that you overlook this and bear with us as we try to reinforce grammatical concepts. In answering the exercises, we strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and write down the answers on paper with a pen.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer the exercises verbally without writing them down,</li>
<li>look up the answers before attempting to write the answer yourself,</li>
<li>look up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them,</li>
<li>proceed to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a proficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by oneself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts independently.</p>
<p>You may also find yourself having to go back a few chapters every once in a while and revising the concepts therein. This is very normal and not a cause for any alarm. It may also prove beneficial to re-do the exercises of that chapter when this occurs.</p>
