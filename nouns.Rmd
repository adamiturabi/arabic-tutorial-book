# Nouns

## Introduction

Here are some examples of common nouns in Arabic:

Arabic word | Transcription|Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:----------------
[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  |[rajulun]{.trn}   |a man
[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} |[kitAbun]{.trn}   |a book
[بَيْتٌ]{.ar}  |[baytun]{.trn}    |a house
[شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} |[cajaratun]{.trn} |a tree

## Indefinite and definite nouns

"A book" is [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}. If we want to say "the book" we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word and we also change the [n]{.trn}-mark at the end of the word [بٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn} to the short vowel [بُ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}.

[كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
[kitAbun]{.trn}  
"a book"

[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar}  
[alkitAbu]{.trn}  
"the book"

Note that [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} so the [hamzah]{.trn} will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence.

When a noun has an [n]{.trn}-mark like [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" we will call it an indefinite noun.
When a noun has [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} and no [n]{.trn}-mark like [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book" we will call it a definite noun.

## Sun letters and moon letters

“A man” in Arabic is [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}. To make this definite we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word and we also change the [n]{.trn}-mark at the end of the word [لٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn} to the short vowel [لُ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}. But instead of becoming [ٱَلْرَجُلُ]{.ar} [alrajulu]{.trn} the word becomes [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. The [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the [ر]{.ar} gets doubled. This happens because the first letter [ر]{.ar} in the word [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is from a group of letters called the sun letters. For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is put in the beginning, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.

The rest of the letters in the alphabet are called the moon letters and for these letters [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, we have already seen that [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" becomes [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book".

The sun letters are [ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن]{.ar}.  
The moon letters are [ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي]{.ar}.

"The sun" in Arabic is [ٱَلشَّمْسُ]{.ar} [accamsu]{.trn} and "the moon" is [ٱَلْقَمَرُ]{.ar} [alqamaru]{.trn}. From these two nouns the groups of letters get the names "sun letters" and "moon letters".

## The state of a noun

When a noun ends with a [◌ٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn}-mark or [ــُـ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}-mark, then we say that it is in the u-state. The same noun can also end with [ــًـ]{.ar} [an]{.trn}-mark or [ــَـ]{.ar} [a]{.trn}-mark then it will be in the a-state. And it can also end with [ــٍـ]{.ar} [in]{.trn}-mark or [ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}-mark, then it is in the i-state.

Example:

State         | Indefinite       | Definite
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
u-state       |[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book"
a-state       |[كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [alkitAba]{.trn} "the book"
i-state       |[كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [alkitAbi]{.trn} "the book"

In Arabic a noun can be in different states depending on its function in a sentence. We will learn more about this later if Allah wills.

## Nouns that begin with connecting [hamzah]{.trn}

When the definite article [ٱََلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} is prefixed to a noun which begins with a nounconnecting [hamzah]{.trn}, the [hamzah]{.trn} is not pronounced. Instead the [lAm]{.trn} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} will take an [i]{.trn}-mark. For example, [ٱِبْنٌ]{.ar} [Eibnun]{.trn} "a son" becomes [ٱَلِٱبْنُ]{.ar} [Ealibnu]{.trn} "the son".

## Irregular nouns

There are two nouns which are irregular in their definiteness and indefniteness that we will now discuss:

Besides [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man", Arabic has another word for "a man": [ٱِمْرَأٌ]{.ar} [EimraEun]{.trn} (u-state). In the a-state and i-state, this word would regularly become [ٱِمْرَءًا]{.ar} [EimraEan]{.trn} and [ٱِمْرَإٍ]{.ar} [EimraEin]{.trn} respectively. However, as a very common variant, it appears with the [n]{.trn}-marks as shown in the table below:

State         | Regular indefinite | Irregular indefinite
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
u-state       |[ٱِمْرَأٌ]{.ar} [EimraEun]{.trn} |[ٱِمْرُؤٌ]{.ar} [EimruEun]{.trn}
a-state       |[ٱِمْرَءًا]{.ar} [EimraEan]{.trn}|[ٱِمْرَءًا]{.ar} [EimraEan]{.trn}
i-state       |[ٱِمْرَإٍ]{.ar} [EimraEin]{.trn} |[ٱِمْرِئٍ]{.ar} [EimriEin]{.trn}

As you can see, the state of the noun affects the vowel not only on the final letter but also on the letter before it. This irregularity is only commonly found with this noun.

Also irregularly, when making this noun definite by prefixing [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, the noun loses its connecting [hamzah]{.trn} altogether and is further modified somewhat from the indefinite. It must be noted that this is the only form allowed for the definite.

State         | Definite
:-------------|:-----------------
u-state       |[ٱَلْمَرْءُ]{.ar} [EalmarEu]{.trn}
a-state       |[ٱَلْمَرْءَ]{.ar} [EalmarEa]{.trn}
i-state       |[ٱَلْمَرْءِ]{.ar} [EalmarEi]{.trn}

The counterpart of this noun [ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar} [EimraEatun]{.trn} "a woman" is also irregular but only in forming the definite noun:

State         | Indefinite                    | Definite
:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------
u-state       |[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar} [EimraEatun]{.trn}|[ٱَلْمَرْأَةُ]{.ar} [EalmarEatu]{.trn}
a-state       |[ٱِمْرَأَةً]{.ar} [EimraEatan]{.trn}|[ٱَلْمَرْأَةَ]{.ar} [EalmarEata]{.trn}
i-state       |[ٱِمْرَأَةٍ]{.ar} [EimraEatin]{.trn}|[ٱَلْمَرْأَةِ]{.ar} [EalmarEati]{.trn}

By the way, what is difference between [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} and [ٱِمْرَأٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn}?
There is some degree of overlap but the noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is used more commonly when talking about male human beings.
[ٱِمْرَأٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn} is used generally when speaking about "man" generically, for example, in sentences like "Man is a social animal." and "A man should always be honest." It is also often used to mean "a person".

## Usage of definite and indefinite nouns

In Arabic a noun must be either definite (with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, for example) or indefinite (with an [n]{.trn}-mark, for example). Such is not the case in English. For example, it is possible to use the word "meat" without the definite article "the" or an indefinite article like "some". So all of the following sentences are viable:

1. I ate the meat.
2. I ate some meat.
3. I ate meat.

In Arabic, when translating the sentences above we will use [ٱللَّحْمَ]{.ar} [EallaHma]{.trn} "the meat" for sentence 1, and [لَحْمًا]{.ar} [laHman]{.trn} "some meat" for sentence 2. For sentence 3 we must choose either [ٱللَّحْمَ]{.ar} [EallaHma]{.trn} or [لَحْمًا]{.ar} [laHman]{.trn}. In this case we will probably choose [لَحْمًا]{.ar} [laHman]{.trn} "some meat" because this is closer in meaning to what we are giving to understand.

In other cases we will choose the definite noun (with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, for example) where in English a noun is used without a definite or indefinite article. For example in an abstract noun like "knowledge" when used in the sentence: "Knowledge is power." Here, in Arabic, we will use [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} [Ealeilmu]{.trn} "the knowledge", and not [عِلْمٌ]{.ar} [eilmun]{.trn} "a knowledge/some knowledge".
