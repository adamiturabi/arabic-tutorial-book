# Nouns

## Introduction

Here are some examples of common nouns in Arabic:

Arabic word | Transcription|Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:----------------
[رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  |[rajulun]{.trn}   |a man
[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} |[kitAbun]{.trn}   |a book
[بَيْتٌ]{.ar}  |[baytun]{.trn}    |a house
[شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} |[cajaratun]{.trn} |a tree

## Indefinite and definite nouns

"A book" is [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}. If we want to say "the book" we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word and we also change the [n]{.trn}-mark at the end of the word [بٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn} to the short vowel [بُ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}.

[كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
[kitAbun]{.trn}  
"a book"

[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar}  
[alkitAbu]{.trn}  
"the book"

Note that [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} has a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} so the [hamzah]{.trn} will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence.

When a noun has an [n]{.trn}-mark like [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" we will call it an indefinite noun.
When a noun has [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} and no [n]{.trn}-mark like [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book" we will call it a definite noun.

## Sun letters and moon letters

“A man” in Arabic is [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}. To make this definite we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word and we also change the [n]{.trn}-mark at the end of the word [لٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn} to the short vowel [لُ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}. But instead of becoming [ٱَلْرَجُلُ]{.ar} [alrajulu]{.trn} the word becomes [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. The [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the [ر]{.ar} gets doubled. This happens because the first letter [ر]{.ar} in the word [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is from a group of letters called the sun letters. For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is put in the beginning, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.

The rest of the letters in the alphabet are called the moon letters and for these letters [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, we have already seen that [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" becomes [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book".

The sun letters are [ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن]{.ar}.  
The moon letters are [ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي]{.ar}.

"The sun" in Arabic is [ٱَلشَّمْسُ]{.ar} [accamsu]{.trn} and "the moon" is [ٱَلْقَمَرُ]{.ar} [alqamaru]{.trn}. From these two nouns the groups of letters get the names "sun letters" and "moon letters".

## The state of a noun

When a noun ends with a [◌ٌ]{.ar} [un]{.trn}-mark or [ــُـ]{.ar} [u]{.trn}-mark, then we say that it is in the u-state. The same noun can also end with [ــًـ]{.ar} [an]{.trn}-mark or [ــَـ]{.ar} [a]{.trn}-mark then it will be in the a-state. And it can also end with [ــٍـ]{.ar} [in]{.trn}-mark or [ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}-mark, then it is in the i-state.

Example:

State         | Indefinite       | Definite
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
u-state       |[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} "the book"
a-state       |[كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [alkitAba]{.trn} "the book"
i-state       |[كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn} "a book" |[ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [alkitAbi]{.trn} "the book"

In Arabic a noun can be in different states depending on its function in a sentence. We will learn more about this later if Allah wills.

## Add:

nouns that start with hamzat wasl
making imra'un and imra'atun definite.
also doubly declined when indefinite


## Generic nouns

There are some nouns which in English we typically use with a general meaning. We use these nouns without "a" or "the" like "knowledge", "generosity". For example, we say "Knowledge is power.", not "The knowldedge is power." or "A knowledge is power."

There are times, however, when we may use them with "a" or "the". For example, "He taught people with **the** knowledge that he had learned." or "He learning **a** knowledge that few knew."

In Arabic, however, when we want to express this generic meaning, we must use the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} and make the noun definite, for example [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} means "knowledge" and "the knowledge". This is because if we were to say [عِلْمٌ]{.ar}, it would mean "**a** knowledge."
