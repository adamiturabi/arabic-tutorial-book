# Nouns

A noun is a word which is used as a name for a person, place or thing. Examples are "man", "school", "book".

Nouns can either be definite like "the book", or indefinite like "a book". In English, to make a noun indefinite, we put "a" before it. And to make it definite we put "the" before it.

In Arabic, to make a noun indefinite we put an [n]{.trn}-mark at the end. For example,

[بَيْتٌ]{.ar}
[baytun]{.trn}
a house

To make the noun definite, we remove the [n]{.trn}-mark and replace it with the corresponding short vowel. We also add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to it

## Generic nouns

There are some nouns which in English we typically use with a general meaning. We use these nouns without "a" or "the" like "knowledge", "generosity". For example, we say "Knowledge is power.", not "The knowldedge is power." or "A knowledge is power."

There are times, however, when we may use them with "a" or "the". For example, "He taught people with **the** knowledge that he had learned." or "He learning **a** knowledge that few knew."

In Arabic, however, when we want to express this generic meaning, we must use the [ٱَلْ]{.ar} and make the noun definite, for example [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} means "knowledge" and "the knowledge". This is because if we were to say [عِلْمٌ]{.ar}, it would mean "**a** knowledge."
