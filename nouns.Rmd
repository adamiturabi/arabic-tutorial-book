# Nouns

A noun is a word which is used as a name for a person, place or thing. Examples are "man", "school", "book".

Nouns can either be definite like "the book", or indefinite like "a book". In English, to make a noun indefinite, we put "a" before it. And to make it definite we put "the" before it.

In Arabic, to make a noun indefinite we put an [n]{.trn}-mark at the end. For example,

[بَيْتٌ]{.ar}
[baytun]{.trn}
a house

To make the noun definite, we remove the [n]{.trn}-mark and replace it with the corresponding short vowel. We also add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to it
