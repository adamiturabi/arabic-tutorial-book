# The noun as a verb-like governor

## Introduction

There are some nouns that are like verbs.
In that they may have the meaning of a verb (like the ;masdar;),
or they have be derived from a verb (like the ;mushtaqq;s: the ;ism_fail;, the ;ism_maful;, etc.).

In this chapter we will study their ability to govern a ;faa3il; or a ;maful;.

## The ;ism_fail; as a governor

Consider the verb
yaDribu.
For example:

(@) zaydun yaDribu 3amran

The sentence is parsed as follows:
* zaydun is a ;mubtada;
* The ;xabar; of zaydun is the inner sentence yaDribu 3amran
* yaDribu is a ;ustate; verb. It governs its a singular masculine ;mustatir; pronoun in the ;ustate; as its ;faa3il;.
  The ;mustatir; pronoun refers back to the mubtada.
* 3amran is a ;mafulb; governed in the ;astate; by yaDribu.

Let's consider the inner sentence
yaDribu 3amran
It is a complete sentence consisting a two ;3umdah; elements:

 i. The ;muxbar3;: the singular masculine ;faa3il; pronoun of the verb yaDribu
ii. The ;muxbar;: the verb yaDribu

The ;mafulb; is a ;fadlah; element, and the inner sentence will be grammatically complete without it.

The above analysis is our starting point.
Now we come to our discussion regarding the ;ism_fail;.
The ;ism_fail; is technically a noun.
But because of it derivation from the verb, it has some verbal qualities.

Instead of using the verb yaDribu in example () above
we may instead use its ;ism_fail;
DArib, thus:

(@) zaydun DAribun 3amran

Using the ;ism_fail; instead of the verb affects the meaning of the sentence.
Using DArib instead of yaDrib can be seen as asserting the fact that Zayd is beating 3amr.
We wil study the meaning implications of using an ;ism_fail; vs a verb in more detail in section\ (ref) below.
For now, let's focus on the grammar of the new sentence.
If we parse example () we get the following analysis:

* zaydun is a ;mubtada; in the ;ustate;.
* DAribun is the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; in the ;ustate;.
  It governs its a singular masculine ;mustatir; pronoun in the ;ustate; as its ;faa3il;.
  The ;mustatir; pronoun refers back to the mubtada.
* 3amran is a ;mafulb; governed in the ;astate; by yaDribu.

DIAGRAM with dotted line for rabt/3aaid

Note that, just like the verb yaDribu,
DAribun now governs a ;faa3il; and the ;mafulb;.

Implicating the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun is essential for the grammar of the sentence.
And we will get to it in section\ (ref) below.
But before we do that, let's discuss an important difference of the new sentence () zaydun DAribun 3amran from the old sentence () zaydun yaDribu 3amran:

And that is that
Daribun 3amran
is not an inner sentence.
This is because it is not a complete sentence.
The single word DAribun itself is the ;xabar; of zaydun.
The two ;3umdah; elements are:
zayd (the ;muxbar3;), and DAribun (the ;muxbar;).
The ;mustatir; singular masculine ;faa3il; pronoun) does not make an inner sentence with its governor DAribun.
We can understanding this by seeing that we can say 
yaDribu 3amran
as a complete sentence to mean "He beat 3amr."
But we cannot say
DAribun 3amran.
as a complete sentence.
DAribun 3amran
requires Zaydun as a ;mubtada; to form one complete sentence.
Nevertheless,
the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun is an integral part of the ;ism_fail; DArib and is governed by it in the ;ustate;.

## Conditions for using the ;ism_fail; as a verb-like governor

There are X conditions that need to be satisfied for using the ;ism_fail; as a governor:

wa kalbuhum baasiTun dhiraa3ayhi

## Implicating the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun

<!--
The adjectival meaning of the ;ism_fail; is in its capacity as a verb-like noun.
So qaaimun standing
-->
<!--
The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun accompanies its governing ;ism_fail; in most cases.
-->
The ;ism_fail; is requires a ;faa3il; whenever it is acting as a verb-like governor.
This includes when the ;ism_fail; is used as a ;sifah;.
This is because the ;sifah; meaning of an ;ism_fail; is derived from its verbal meaning.
And the use of the ;ism_fail; as a ;sifah; satsfies the conditions for the ;ism_fail; being a verb-like governor
because it signifies a description that is applicable in the present tense.

For example
qaa'imun
"standing"
gets this adjectival meaning from the verb
qaama yaqoomu.

Zaydun qaaimun.
Zayd is presently standing

kaana zaydun qaaiman
Zayd was (presently) standing.

The fact that the ;ism_fail; requires a ;faa3il; when acting as a verb-like governor is,
in fact,
<!--
It is in fact
-->
the reason why a ;ism_fail; (when used with its verbal meaning) in the ;xabar; will match the ;mubtada; in gender.

hindun qaaimatun

The mark of femininity [ة]{.ar} indicates the the ;faa3il; (the ;mustatir; pronoun which refers back the the ;mubtada; hindun) is feminine.
This is perfectly analagous to when a verb (that has the mark of femininity) is used in the ;xabar;

hindun qAmat

### Cases when the ;ism_fail; will not have a ;faa3il;

#### When the ;ism_fail; is used with a substantive meaning {.unnumbered}

As we know from chapter\ (ref), an ;ism_fail; can acquire a substantive meaning.
For example,
jaami3ah univ
qaaimah leg.
When used with a substantive meaning, the implication of the verb is now remote, and the ;ism_fail; behaves like any other substantive in that it won't have a ;faa3il;.
And this is the reason why,
when the ;ism_fail; is used as a substantive in the ;xabar;,
then it does not need to match ;mubtada; in gender.
In other words, there is no ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun,
which refers back to to the ;mubtada;
to cause the ;ism_fail; to get a mark of feminiity.

al-bina'u jaamiyah // gender matching not required.
hadhihi l-khashabu qaa'imatun lil-khiwaan.

#### When the ;ism_fail; ...

When the ;ism_fail; is not a verb-like governor, then the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun is not implicated.
This is in the following cases:

When the ;ism_fail; is used as a common noun.


## Replacing the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun with an apparent noun

zaydun hindun DAribuhaa huwa

Abuuhu

ism_fail remains singular. Matches doer in gender

xabar is still mufrad, not a jumlah

## The ;sababi; ;na3t;

We mentioned in section\ (ref) above that the ism_fail requires a faa3il whenever it is acting as a verb-like gov.
And this includes when the ism_fail is a ;sifah;.
And we have examples of an ism_fail as a ;sifah; when it is a ;xabar;
But the ;sifah; is also used as a ;na3t;.
Here too, the ;faa3il; of the ;ism+fail; is implicated.
It refers back to ;manut;
And again it is the reason why the ;ism_fail; gets a mark of femininity to match the gender of the manut when the manut is feminine.

DIAGRAM use [hiya] as implicated faa3il.

Now, just like the ;mustatir; faa3il pronoun can replaced with an apparent noun when it is a xabar,
so too

** Important ** : Hidden pronoun requires gender matching of ism_fail to its mufassir
