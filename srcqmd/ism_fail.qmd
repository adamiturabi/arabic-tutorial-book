# Semantic aspects of the ;ism_fail;

## Ascribing the quality of being the ;faa3il; of a verb

(improper annexation should already have been discussed)

We have seen that, subject to certain conditions, the ;ism_fail; can behave like a verb. 
In that it can govern a ;faa3il; and a ;mafulb;.
In this section we will discuss
the shade of meaning that the ;ism_fail; conveys when it is used instead of a verb.

The primary meaning of the ;faa3il; participle is that of the ;faa3il; of a verb. Here are some examples:

|;ism_fail;| meaning |
|--:|:----|
|[قَاتِل]{.ar} | one who kills/a killer |
|[ضَاحِك]{.ar} | one who laughs  |
|[قَائِل]{.ar} | one who says |
|[مُتَكَلِّم]{.ar} | one who speaks/a speaker |
|[كَاتِب]{.ar} | one who writes/a writer |

Using a verb primarily indicates the occurrence of an action.
For example:

(@) Jama3a zayd  
    Zayd gathered

(@) Yajma3u zaydun  
    Zayd gathers/ will gather.

In the examples above,
the verb jama3a signifies that the action of gathering occurred. 
And the verb yajma3u signifies that the action of gathering is occurring or will occur.

When we use the ism_fail jaami3 instead, its primary significance is to ascribe the quality of being a gatherer.
For example:

(@) al-Salatu jaami3atun likulli- al-naas [Lane]  
    "The prayer is a collector of all the people."

<!--
The ;ism_fail; jaami3 does not, by itself, imply the occurrence of a gathering event.
But such an occurrence may be understood from context.
For example:

al-Salaatu jaami3atun [bukhari:1045; muslim:901e]
"The prayer is gathering (imminently)."
-->

### Temporary vs permanent applicability of the ;ism_fail;

We have seen that the ism_fail’s primary significance is to ascribe the quality of being ;faa3il; of the verb,
rather than signifying the occurrence of the action of the verb.
In general, the permanence of this meaning (of one who does the action of the verb) can range from:

+ Temporary to only when the action of the verb occurs.
+ Permanent beyond the action of verb, such that the ism_fail indicates a permanent adjectival quality.

<!--
For example:
Zaydun SaaliHun
-->

Some ;ism_fail;s fall squarely into one or the other category.
For example, 
naa’im (from naama "to sleep") is an example of an ism_fail that is applicable to only when the action of the verb naama occurs. Someone won’t be described as naai’m after he has woken up.
On the other hand,
3aadil (from 3adala "to be just") is an example of an ism_fail with a more permanent meaning. Someone can be described as 3aadil even when he is not in the action of being just.

<!--
Sometimes, the same ism_fail can vary in how temporary or permanent this meaning is.
We saw an example of this with the ism_fail jaami3 in examples () and () above.
-->

The ;ism_fail; can also indicate a state so stable that it has acquired the status of a skill.^[marmor 127]
For example:

(@) Wa kaana 3umaru kaatiban.

When used as such, the ;ism_fail; loses some of its verbal force and becomes closer to a substantive.

We mentioned above that the primary significance of the ;ism_fail; is to ascribe the quality of being the one who does the action of the verb.
Because of this, the ;ism_fail; can be used to differentiate between one who truly does the action of a certain verb,
and someone who may have done the action but not sufficiently enough to earn the ism_fail as an epithet. [Surah al-kaafiroon, ibn al-qayyim]

On the flip side, one may have committed an act of disbelief or innovation, but may have done it out of ignorance or mistakenly. So, even if he is referred to as a kaafir or mubtadi3, then this will be only an incidental reference, i.e., limited to the incident of his action.
And it is possible that he won’t be referred to as such in general.

In a similar manner, someone who can generally be ascribed with an ism_fail, may lose that ascription due to the severity of another negating action. [hadith believer when he steals]

<!--
Stative vs dynamic verbs
When talking about the significance of the ism_fail we will talk about stative and dynamic verbs.
A stative verb is not associated with an event. It gives the meaning of being in a static state. For example, صلح to be honest عدل to be just

A dynamic verb is associated with an event. A dynamic event is one that is either momentary or one that implies a final goal or a point at which the event ends. 
-->

## Tenses of the ;ism_fail; not defined by [ٱل]{.ar}

In general, the u-state mudarie verb can be used in three situations:

  i. To express a future event. For example yaktubu zaydun ghadan. Zayd will write tomorrow. sa/sawfa can be used with with the mudarie for this meaning.
 ii. To express an on-going continuous action. Zaydun yaktubu l-aana, [kaana] zaydun yaktubu amsi. [sayakuunu] zaydun yaktubu ghadan. Zayd will be writing tomorrow.
iii. To express a habitual action. Yaktubu Zaydun kulla yawmin. Zayd writes every day.

In the examples above we used words like aana, ghadan to explicitly indicate the tense.
Without these words, all three meanings are still possible. So yaktubu zaydun can signify all three tenses. Context will be needed to tell us which meaning is meant.

When the ;ism_fail; (without al) is used instead of a mudarie verb, then it too, in general, can be used in the three positions above.
In all three situations,
the main difference in significance between using a mudarie verb and using its ism_fail is that the verb calls attention to the occurrence of an action,
whereas the ism_fail calls attention to the ;faa3il;’s being in a state that is brought about by the doing of the verb.

### The ;ism_fail; used to express a future event

Here are an example of the ;ism_fail; used to express a future event:

(@) [إني ذاهب إلى ربي سيهدين]{.ar}

(@) [فَهُوَ ذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاسِ]{.ar} muslim:2959a

(@) [إني ذاكر لك أمرا]{.ar} bukhari:1925

(@) [أنا فاعل]{.ar} tirmidhi:2433

(@) [جاعل في الأرض خليفة]{.ar}

(@) [زَعَمَ ابْنُ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ قَاتِلٌ رَجُلاً قَدْ أَجَرْتُهُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6158@]{.citex}  
    "My maternal brother claims that he will kill a man whom I have given protection to."

If a ;mudarie; verb is used to express a future event,
then it merely signifies that the speaker thinks that the ;faa3il; will take an action.
For example, the mudarie verb in the utterance سأذهب merely signifies the speaker’s intention of going some time in the future.

In contrast, the use of the ism_fail is an assertion announcing that, in the estimation of the speaker, the event will definitely take place.
In other words, it signifies that the ;faa3il;’s action is so settled and resolved in the speaker’s mind that it is as if the ;faa3il; has already entered the state and can be described by the ism_fail.
So, for example, if the speaker says أنا ذاهب and the context tells us he is referring to a future action, then the use of the ism_fail ذاهب instead of the mudarie ver يذهب, signifies that the speaker is so sure that he will do this action that he can already be described by ذاهب "one who is in a state of going".

The use of the ism_fail instead of the mudarie verb to express a future event can also, depending on context, indicate that the event is imminent, i.e. that it is in the very near future.
In such cases it can be translated using "be going to".
For example:

(@) [فَقَالَ عُتْبَةُ:لَا شَيْءَ، أَنَا **خَارِجٌ**]{.ar} [marmor 171]

#### The ;ism_fail; used to express a hypothetical future event {.unnumbered}

The ;ism_fail; can also be used to express a hypothetical event.
Examples:

(@) [فَقَالَ عُمَرُ: ائْذَنْ لِي فِيهِ، قَالَ:" أَوَ كُنْتَ قَاتِلَهُ]{.ar} ahmad:5878

(@) [لو كنت قاتلا رسولا]{.ar}

(@) [لو كنت جاعلا لمشرك دية]{.ar}

#### The ;ism_fail; used to express entering into a future static state {.unnumbered}

The usage of the ;ism_fail; to express a future event is typically in the case of verbs that signify an event.
Some verbs are not associated with an event as much as they are associated with being in a (static) state. For example كان to be.
For such verbs the ;ism_fail; can express the entering into the state associated with the verb.
For example:

(@) [فإنه كائن لابن أخيك هذا شأن عظيم]{.ar} [kinberg 320 quoting youssef from ibn Hisham]  
    "Because there is going to be, for this son of your brother, a great importance"


### The ;ism_fail; used to indicate a concurrent state

In addition to expressing a future event, the ;ism_fail; is also used to express being in a static state that is concurrent to some past, present, or future reference point.
In contrast, the ;mudarie; verb indicates that the doer is doing a dynamic action.
Consider the following example:

(@) [كُنْتُ مُسَافِرًا فَأَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ **يَأْكُلُ** وَأَنَا **صَائِمٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:2281@]{.citex}
    "I was traveling and I came to the Prophet while he was eating and I was fasting."

The verb [يَأْكُلُ]{.ar} indicates a dynamic activity, where the ;faa3il; is actively eating.
Whereas the ;ism_fail; [صَائِم]{.ar} calls attention to the ;faa3il;'s being in a (static) state of fasting, and not to his actively doing anything.
Here are some more examples:

(@) []

Even when the ;ism_fail; is derived from a verb that is associated with a dynamic activity,
the ;ism_fail; is used (instead of the ;mudarie; verb) when the speaker (or writer) wishes to signify the ;faa3il;'s being in a state of doing the activity.
Instead, the ;mudarie; verb is used when the ;faa3il;'s actively doing the activity is highlighted.
For example:

(@) [فَلَبِثَ الْأَوْسُ وَالْخَزْرَجُ **مُتَحَارِبِينَ** عِشْرِينَ سَنَةً فِي أَمْرِ سُمَيْرٍ]{.ar}
    [marmor 134]{.citex}  
    "So [al-E#aws]{.trn2} and [al-#xazraj]{.trn2} kept fighting for twenty years because of the matter of Sumayr."

Because the ;ism_fail;, when used in this way, signifies being in a state,
it will often (but not always) not have a ;mafulb;, even if the ;ism_fail; is derived from a transitive verb,
A ;mudarie; verb can then follow the ;ism_fail; with the ;mafulb; if needed.
For example:

(@) [فَخَرَجْنَا **خَائِفِينَ** نَخَافُ الرَّصَدَ]{.ar}
    [maghazi 28 in marmor 138]{.citex}
    "So we set out afraid, fearing ambush."

Here are some more examples of the ;ism_fail; indicating a static state:

(@3amal_ism_fail_3aamilun_ya3mal) [وَرُزَيْقٌ عَامِلٌ عَلَى أَرْضٍ يَعْمَلُهَاة]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:893@]{.citex}  
    "Ruzaiq was (in a state of) working on the land, working (i.e. farming) it."  

Note how, in example\ (@3amal_ism_fail_3aamilun_ya3mal) above,
the ;ism_fail; [عَامِل]{.ar} is used without a ;mafulb;, indicating being in a state of working.
Whereas the ;mudarie; verb [يَعْمَلُ]{.ar} is used with the ;mafulb; to indicate doing the work.


### Motion and posture verbs

### Perfective

(@) [قَالَ جَابِرٌ فَبَيْنَا أَنَا نَازِلٌ تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ إِذَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/malik/48/1@]{.citex}
    "While I was [resting] dismounted under a tree, the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; [came]."

    ضائع
    طالق

### Not used for verbs of perception

### ;ism_fail; and ;mudarie; verb used equivalently

In the preceding discussion we have attempted to show the difference in meaning between
when a ;mudarie; verb is used and when its ;ism_fail; is used instead.
In closing,
we will also mention that the differences we have listed are often a general trend, and not a fixed rule.
Sometimes, we find ;mudarie; verbs and their ;ism_fail;s used equivalently.
Here are some examples:

### Negating the ;ism_fail;

## DELETE:

We said above that the ism_fail calls attention to the ;faa3il;’s being in a state that is brought about by doing the action of the verb.


The type of action of a verb can range from a _dynamic event_ to a static state.
//The ism_fail of a verb can refer to either a dynamic event or a static state.
A dynamic event is one that is either momentary or one that implies a final goal or a point at which the event ends. [kinberg: semi-imperfectives and imperfectives 320].
For example,
xalaqa refers to an event of creating.
ja3ala refers to an event of making
The verbs and ism_fails associated with a dynamic event are also called bounded because the dynamic event bounds or limits the beginning or end of state associated with the verbs ism_fail.

Like the mudarie verb, the ism_fail not defined by al, when used with verbal force, can have two main significations:

An imminent future action
A static state that is concurrent to some point of reference

We will discuss each of these in detail below.

Future:
An dyevent
A state
A
Mudarie can have modal nuances
Can’t say innii 3aadil for future because unbounded

Static state:
Mudarie is dynamic


## NOTES:

Add istimraar. See kinberg iterative and za3balawi https://shamela.ws/book/2120/482

When Ism_fail signifies being in an on-going state. (as opposed to imminent future):
Even when lexeme is dynamic, ism_fail forces a static meaning.
عامل in a state of working
If ism_fail on it’s own sufficiently signifies the state then it often does not to have a mafulb. A following mudari verb is commonly brought for the mafulb.

Bukhari 893 ورزيق عامل على الأرض يعملها
Marmor 137 فخرجنا خاءفين نخاف الرصد

But if the ism_fail requires an object to complete the meaning, then it may occur as a doee to the ism_fail:
Wa huwa muDTaji3un 3alaa firaashihi laabisun mirTa 3aaishata
Wa huwa muntaZirun wilaadahaa 



SECTION

The active participle can an imply action embarked upon, whose effects are still apparent [owens: The participle]
Punctual: jalasa, labisa, waqafa, ittafaqa
Durative; mashaa, qaama, tazaayada


قالوا إنا لضالون kinberg

With motion verbs, the ism_fail indicates the situation of being in a move, rather than actual kinesis or progression [marmor 127]
Marmor 7.4 qaaSidun naHwahu

The ism_fail can continue to signify being in a state even when the action was an event has been completed.
