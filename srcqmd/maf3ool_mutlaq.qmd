# The absolute doee

## Introduction

The absolute doee is, fundamentally, the verb taking it's own
[maSdar]{.trn2}
as a doee in the a-state.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

In the above example
[ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
is the 
[maSdar]{.trn2}
of the verb
[ضَرَبَ].{ar}
and is governed by it in the a-state as its absolute doee.

This sort of sentence is unfamiliar in English,
as evinced by its awkward trabnslation,
"Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating."
Nevertheless, we can find some parallels so you can get a feel for it:

(@) 1. "He died an honorable death."
    2. "He slept the sleep of the just."
    3. "He lived two lives."

The absolute doee is somewhat different from the direct doee in that the direct doee only occurs for transitive verbs.
Whereas, the absolute doee can occur for any verb, whether transitive or intransitive.
Also, the absolute doee is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The absolute doee is used for the following purposes:

1. To reinforce or emphasize the meaning of the governing verb.
2. To qualify the meaning of the governing verb.
3. To act as a deputy for the governing verb, substituting it and fulfilling it's role.

## The reinforcing absolute doee

Reinforcing and emphasizing the meaning of the governing verb is the basic function of the absolute doee.
Consider again our earlier example:

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

The absolute doee [ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
counters any possible suspicion that the action of the verb didn't occur.
