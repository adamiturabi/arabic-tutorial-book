# The ;mmutlaq;

## Introduction

The ;mmutlaq; is, fundamentally, the verb taking it's own
;masdar;
as a ;maful; in the ;astate;.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

In the above example
[ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
is the 
;masdar;
of the verb
[ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
and is governed by it in the ;astate; as its ;mmutlaq;.

This sort of sentence is unfamiliar in English,
as evinced by its awkward translation,
"Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating."
Nevertheless, we can find some parallels so you can get a feel for it:

(@) 1. "He died an honorable death."
    2. "He slept the sleep of the just."
    3. "He lived two lives."

The ;mmutlaq; is somewhat different from the direct ;maful; in that the ;mafulb; only occurs for ;mutaddi; verbs.
Whereas, the ;mmutlaq; can occur for any verb, whether ;mutaddi; or ;lazim;
Also, the ;mmutlaq; is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The ;mmutlaq; is used for the following purposes:

1. To reinforce or emphasize the meaning of the governing verb.
2. To qualify the meaning of the governing verb.
3. To act as a ;naib; for the governing verb, substituting it and fulfilling it's role.

## The reinforcing ;mmutlaq;

Reinforcing and emphasizing the meaning of the governing verb is the basic function of the ;mmutlaq;.
Consider again our earlier example:

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

The ;mmutlaq; [ضَرْبًا]{.ar} signifies that beating actually ocurred,
as if to
counter any possible suspicion that it didn't.
If the usage of the governing verb can support both a literal and a metaphorical meaning, then
the ;mmutlaq; can also signify that the meaning of the verb is literal, and not metaphorical.^[See [معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/194--195. But see also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-alqayyim/4/164> ([وكلم الله موسى تكليما]{.ar}) and <https://tafsir.app/ibn-uthaymeen/27/50> ([ومكروا مكرًا ومكرنا مكرًا]{.ar})]

For greater emphasis, the ;masdar; may be repeated.^[Wright, 2/55B]
For example,

<!--
(@) [إِذَا دُكَّتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ دَكًّا دَكَّا]{.ar}
is passive...
-->

The reinforcing ;mmutlaq;, when used purely for emphasis and not also for other purposes, cannot be dualized or pluralized.
So we cannot say $\times$\ [وَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا]{.ar} ("I promised you promises").^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/211]
Though, this sentence is correct for the other purposes of the ;mmutlaq;, which we will learn in subsequent sections,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

## The qualifying ;mmutlaq;

With regard to the meaning of the governing verb, the qualifying ;mmutlaq; indicates either what kind was intended, or its quantity, or both.

The kind of the ;masdar; is frequently used with a ;na3t; or in an ;idaafah;.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
    [Wright, 2/54A]{.citex}  
    "I beat him (with) a severe beating."

(@) [ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَ ٱلظَّالِمِ]{.ar}
    [Wright, 2/54B]{.citex}  
    "He beat him (with) the beating of an oppressor."

Such a qualifying ;mmutlaq; may also be signified simply with the definite article [ٱل]{.ar}.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/207 (footnote 4)]. For example, if a specific kind of beating is known before-hand to both the speaker and addressee, then the speaker may simply say:

(@) [أَضْرِبُهُ ٱلضَّرْبَ]{.ar}  
    "I will beat him (with) _the_ beating."

The qualifying ;masdar; may also be annexed to a pronoun referring to the ;faa3il; of the verb.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبَ ضَرْبَهُ]{.ar}  
    "He beat him (with) his beating"

The quantity of the ;masdar; often uses the _;ism_marrah;_.
It may be dualized or pluralized.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرَبْةً وَضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ أَوْ ضَرَبَاتٍ]{.ar}
    [Wright, 2/53D]{.citex}  
    "I beat him one blow and he beat me two blows or (three or more) blows."

Some ;masdar;s themselves end with a [ة]{.ar}, like [تِلَاوَة]{.ar},
so they are readily dualized or pluralized^[[[الكليات لأبي البقاء الكفوي]{.ar} 817](https://shamela.ws/book/7037/803)]
(to the sound [At]{.trn} plural)
without resorting to the ;ism_marrah;.
For example,

(@) [تَلَا ٱلْقَارِئُ تِلَاوَاتٍ]{.ar}  
    "The reader recited recitations."

But in reality, when a ;masdar; is dualized or pluralized in this manner,
it seems to leave its ;masdar; meaning,
which is purely a verbal meaning,
and begins to denote a concrete or abstract noun.^[[[دراسات في النحو لصلاح الدين الزعبلاوي]{.ar} 137](https://shamela.ws/book/2120/137#p1)]
So [تِلَاوَات]{.ar} will denote, not so much the actions of reciting but kinds of recitations.

The same goes for ;masdar;s that don't end with a [ة]{.ar} but for whom a broken plural has been recorded from Classical Arabic,
like
[عُلُوم]{.ar}, which is the plural of [عِلْم]{.ar} "knowledge",
and [وُعُود]{.ar} which is the plural of [وَعْد]{.ar} "promise".

So we can say:

(@) [وَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا]{.ar}  
    "I promised you promises."

[وُعُود]{.ar} here refers to different kinds or occasions of promises, rather than the purely verbal actions of promising.^[See also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/33/10> ([وتظنون بالله الظنونا]{.ar})]

Plurals have not been recorded for all ;masdar;s.
For example, [ضَرْب]{.ar} does not have a recorded plural for its ;masdar; meaning of "beating".

So can we pluralize it if we wish to say "I beat him (many) kinds of beatings"?
Some authorities allow us to form a new broken plural if there is a need.^[[[دراسات في النحو لصلاح الدين الزعبلاوي]{.ar} 139](https://shamela.ws/book/2120/139#p1)]
So according to them we should be able to 
coin a new plural
[ضُرُوب]{.ar}^[this plural already exists for [ضَرْب]{.ar} but for its other meaning "example"] "beatings"
and say,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضُرُوبًا]{.ar}  
    "I beat him (many kinds of) beatings"

Other authorities are more conservative and would only allow using broken plurals for existing meanings of words if one has been recorded for them. Following this opinion, we might then say:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ أَنْوَاعًا مِنَ ٱلضَّرْبِ]{.ar}  
    "I beat him (many) kinds of beatings"

In any case, any ;masdar; may at least be dualized to indicate the kinds of its action.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/212]
So we can say:

(@) [ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/55D]{.citex}  
    "He beat me two (kinds of) beatings."  
    or  
    "He beat me (on) two (occasions of) beatings."

By the way, you should be able to see that saying
[ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ]{.ar}
is different from if we had said

(@) [ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ]{.ar}  
    "He beat me (with) two blows."

The former signifies the kinds or occasions of beating
whereas the latter indicates the number of individual acts of beating.

By the way, for ;masdar;s that themselves end with [ة]{.ar},
if we wish to specify that the action ocurred only once,
we cannot, of course, form a ;ism_marrah; by appending another [ة]{.ar} to it.
In such a case, we may qualify the ;masdar; with the ;na3t; [وَاحِدَة]{.ar} "once".
For example:

(@) [رَحِمَهُ رَحْمَةً وَاحِدَةً]{.ar}
    [Wright 1/123C]{.citex}  
    "He took one mercy upon him."

It is also important to mention that the qualifying ;mmutlaq; includes the reinforcing meaning.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/207--209]
We cannot use the qualifying ;mmutlaq; without also emphasizing the meaning of the verb.
For example,

(@) [فَٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا]{.ar}
    [<https://quran.com/70/5>]{.citex}  
    "So be patient with gracious patience"

In section (ref), we will see that in order to only qualify the verb without emphasizing it, we can substitute the verb with the ;mmutlaq; which then becomes a _;naib; to the verb_.^[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/203]

Finally, the qualifying ;mmutlaq; may qualify both the kinds and quantity of the meaning of the verb.
For example:

(@) [قَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ قِرَاءَتَيْنِ نَافِعَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/209]{.citex}  
    "I read the book two useful readings."

## The ;naib; to the ;masdar; as an ;mmutlaq;

<!--
لا يوجد ما يسمى النائب عن المفعول المطلق، وإنما يوجد ما ينوب عن المصدر في انتصابه على المفعولية المطلقة، يعني أن المفعول المطلق إما أن يكون مصدرا وهو الأصل أو غير مصدر، فإذا كان غير مصدر سمي نائبا عن المصدر
https://al-maktaba.org/book/31874/5197
-->

Frequently, instead of using the ;masdar; as the ;mmutlaq; directly,
it is substituted by another word.
This word is then called the ;naib; to the ;masdar; as an ;mmutlaq; because it fulfils the ;mmutlaq;'s role.
The ;masdar; may still figure in the expression.
It will just not technically be the ;mmutlaq;, because the first ;astate; ;maful; in that position is now its ;naib;.

The ;naib; to the ;masdar; can be one of several categories:

#### A ;na3t; to a deleted ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
    [Wright, 2/54A]{.citex}  
    "I beat him severely."  
    (for [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا]{.ar} "I beat him a severe beating.")

(@) [سِرْتُ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ]{.ar}
    [[[أوضح المسالك إلى ألفية ابن مالك لابن هشام]{.ar} 2/184](https://shamela.ws/book/11825/551)]{.citex}  
    "I travelled the best (kind) of travelling."  
    (for [سِرْتُ ٱلسَّيْرِ أَحْسَنَ ٱلسَّيْرِ]{.ar})

When the ;masdar; is thus substituted with its ;na3t;, then the masculine ;sifah; is typically used for the ;na3t;,
even if the ;masdar; was a feminine noun.
For example:

(@) [كَتَبُوا سَرِيعًا]{.ar}  
    "They wrote quickly."  
    (for [كَتَبُوا كِتَابَةً سَرِيعَةً]{.ar})

This is because even when
;masdar;s
end with a feminine marker,
they are abstract enough in their meaning that when they are absent,
only the idea of them retains influence, not their actual wording.
And because that abstract idea is not feminine in its meaning,
it doesn't cause the ;na3t; to match the feminine wording of the ;masdar; in gender.
So, by default, the masculine ;sifah; is used for the ;na3t;.

Also, the ;astate; ;sifah; in such phrases as 
[ضَرَبْتُهُ شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
may, where the sense allows or requires it, be a ;naib; to the ;dharf_zaman;
instead of a ;naib; to the ;mmutlaq;.^[Wright 2/54D]
For example: [سَارُوا طَوِيلًا]{.ar} "They travelled a long time,"
(for [سَارُوا زَمَنًا طَوِيلًا]{.ar}. See section\ (ref).)

In fact, according to some authorities,
when the ;astate; noun in such phrases could be applied to both
a deleted ;mmutlaq;
or a deleted ;dharf_zaman;
(or, for that matter, other ;astate; functions like a ;mafulb;),
then it is possible that both meanings could be intended.^[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/196--199]
For example,
[ضَرَبْتُهُ كَثِيرًا]{.ar}
could mean, at the same time, both 
[ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا كَثِيرًا]{.ar}
"I beat him a lot [of beatings]," and
[ضَرَبْتُهُ زَمَنًا كَثِيرًا]{.ar}
"I beat him (for) a lot [of time]."

#### An ;ism_masdar; {.unnumbered}

The ;ism_masdar; may be a regular common noun that is used in place of a verb's ;masdar;
(see (ref)).

For example:

(@) [فَرَجَعَ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَسْلِمُوا فَإِنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يُعْطِي عَطَاءً لاَ يَخْشَى الْفَاقَةَ]{.ar}
    [<https://sunnah.com/muslim:2312a>]{.citex}  
    "So he returned to his people and said, 'O my people, embrace [#islAm]{.trn2} for indeed [#muHammad]{.trn2} gives a gift not fearing want.'"  
    ([عَطَاء]{.ar} "gift" is a ;ism_masdar; for the actual ;masdar; [إِعْطَاء]{.ar}.)

(@) [ٱنْهَزَمُوا هَزِيمَةً شَنِيعَةً]{.ar}  
    [Wright 2/56B]{.citex}  
    "They were defeated an atrocious defeat"  
    (The ;masdar; of [ٱنْهَزَمَ]{.ar} is properly [ٱنْهِزَام]{.ar})

Also falling under the category of ;ism_masdar; is the ;masdar; of another form of the verb from the same root.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/215].
For example:

(@) [ٱقْتَتَلُوا قِتَالًا شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/56B]{.citex}  
    "They fought with one another a hard fight"  
    ([قِتَال]{.ar} is properly the ;masdar; of the form\ 3 verb [قَاتَلَ]{.ar})

(@) [وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلًا]{.ar}
    [<https://quran.com/73/8>]{.citex}  
    "and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion"  
    ([تَبْتِيل]{.ar} is properly the ;masdar; of the form\ 2 verb [بَتَّلَ]{.ar})

#### A synonymous ;masdar; from a different root {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [جَلَسَ قُعُودًا]{.ar}
    [Wright, 2/56C]{.citex}  
    "I sat (with) a sitting"

#### A noun that indicates the type of ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [رَجَعَ ٱاْقَهْقَرَىٰ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/56C]{.citex}  
    "He returned walking backwards."
    [قَهْقَرَىٰ]{.ar} is a noun which means "backward walk".

#### A ;ism_hay2ah; of the pattern [فِعْلَة]{.ar} {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [مشى القط مشية الأسد]{.ar}
    [[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/218]{.citex}  
    "The cat walked (with) the gait of a lion"

#### The number of the ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثَ ضَرَبَاتٍ]{.ar}  
    "I beat him three blows"

The ;masdar; may also be omitted from the base noun such that only the number remains.
For example:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُ ثَلَاثًا]{.ar}  
    "I beat him three (blows)"

#### A partial or whole fraction {.unnumbered}

Words like
[كُلّ]{.ar}, [جَمِيع]{.ar} "all";
[بَعْض]{.ar} "some";
[شَطْر]{.ar} "half"
can be used to indicate how much of an action is done.

For example:

(@) [فَلَا تَيِيلُوا كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ]{.ar}
    [<https://quran.com/4/129>]{.citex}  
    "So do not incline completely [toward one]"

(@) [أَهْمَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ بَعْضَ ٱلْإِهْمَالِ]{.ar}
    [[النحو العربي للسامرائي]{.ar} 1/452]{.citex}  
    "The student was negligent somewhat"

#### The instrument or implement used in the action {.unnumbered}

The type of action may be indicated with the
the instrument or implement used in the action.
For example:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ سَوْطًا]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/56D]{.citex}  
    "I beat him (with) a whip."  
    (for [ضَرْبَ سَوْطٍ]{.ar})

#### A pronoun {.unnumbered}

A ;mmutlaq; can be substituted by a pronoun that refers to it.^[See also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/5/115> ([فَإنِّي أُعَذِّبُهُ عَذابًا لا أُعَذِّبُهُ أحَدًا مِنَ العالَمِينَ]{.ar})]
For example:

(@) [أَحْسَنَ ٱلْإِكْرَامَ وَأَكْرَمَهُ ضَيْفَهُ]{.ar}  
    "He perfected generosity and was generous (with it) [to] his guest."  
    (i.e., he was generous with the generosity)

#### A ;ism_isharah; {.unnumbered}

Similar to the pronoun as a ;naib; ;masdar; ;mmutlaq;, a ;ism_isharah; may be used in the same vein.
For example

(@) [ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُهَذَّبُ لاَ يُعَامِلُ ٱلنَّاسَ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْمُعَامَلَةَ]{.ar}
    [[[النحو الواضح لعلي الجارم]{.ar} 2/159](https://shamela.ws/book/10018/571#p1)]{.citex}

(@) [يَحْفَظُونَ أَسْرَارَهُمْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْحِفْظَ]{.ar}
    [Wright 2/54A]{.citex}  
    "They keep their secrets (with) this keeping"  
    (i.e. so carefully)

## The ;mmutlaq; with a deleted governing verb

The governing verb of the specifying ;mmutlaq; may be deleted
if there is sufficient context or circumstance to supply its meaning.
For example, in response to the question,

[هَلْ جَلَسَ ٱلزَّائِرُ عِنْدَكَ؟]{.ar}  
"Did the visitor sit with you?"

one may reply:

(@) [جُلُوسًا طَوِيلًا]{.ar}
    [[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/219]{.citex}  
    "A long sitting"  
    (for [جَلَسَ جُلُوسًا طَوِيلًا]{.ar} "He sat a long sitting.")

Similarly, if one sees a hunter striking his quarry with an arrow succesfully, he might say:

(@) [إِصَابَةً سَرِيعَةً]{.ar}
    [[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/219]{.citex}  
    "A quick striking"  
    (for [أَصَابَ إِصَابَةً سَرِيعَةً]{.ar} "He struck a quick striking.")

In both the above scenarios, the deleted governing verb is implied.
So the complete sentence includes both the implied governing verb, and the ;mmutlaq;

## The ;mmutlaq; as a ;naib; of the deleted governing verb

In some cases, the deleted governing verb is replaced by the ;mmutlaq;.
For example, instead of using the verb of command [ٱصْبِرْ]{.ar} "Be patient," one may say:

(@) [صَبْرًا]{.ar}
    "Patience"

In this case, the complete sentence is not
[ٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا]{.ar}.
Rather the governing verb 
[ٱصْبِرْ]{.ar}.
is substituted with the ;mmutlaq;,
such that ;mmutlaq; is now a ;naib; of the governing verb.

The sentence
[ٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا]{.ar}
is valid on its own right as a use of the reinforcing ;mmutlaq;.
But it gives a different meaning from 
[صَبْرًا]{.ar},
where the ;mmutlaq; is a ;naib; of the governing verb.^[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/203]


## Other possibilities for governing the ;mmutlaq;

* ;ism_fail;
* ;sifah_mush;
* another ;masdar;
