# The absolute doee

## Introduction

The absolute doee is, fundamentally, the verb taking it's own
[maSdar]{.trn2}
as a doee in the a-state.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

In the above example
[ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
is the 
[maSdar]{.trn2}
of the verb
[ضَرَبَ].{ar}
and is governed by it in the a-state as its absolute doee.

This sort of sentence is unfamiliar in English,
as evinced by its awkward trabnslation,
"Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating."
Nevertheless, we can find some parallels so you can get a feel for it:

(@) 1. "He died an honorable death."
    2. "He slept the sleep of the just."
    3. "He lived two lives."

The absolute doee is somewhat different from the direct doee in that the direct doee only occurs for transitive verbs.
Whereas, the absolute doee can occur for any verb, whether transitive or intransitive.
Also, the absolute doee is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The absolute doee is used for the following purposes:

1. To reinforce or emphasize the meaning of the governing verb.
2. To qualify the meaning of the governing verb.
3. To act as a deputy for the governing verb, substituting it and fulfilling it's role.

## The reinforcing absolute doee

Reinforcing and emphasizing the meaning of the governing verb is the basic function of the absolute doee.
Consider again our earlier example:

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

The absolute doee [ضَرْبًا]{.ar} signifies that beating actually ocurred,
as if to
counter any possible suspicion that it didn't.
If the usage of the governing verb can support both a literal and a metaphorical meaning, then
the absolute doee can also signify that the meaning of the verb is literal, and not metaphorical.^[See [معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/194--195. But see also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-alqayyim/4/164> for [وكلم الله موسى تكليما]{.ar} and <https://tafsir.app/ibn-uthaymeen/27/50> for [ومكروا مكرًا ومكرنا مكرًا]{.ar}]

For greater emphasis, the [maSdar]{.trn2} may be repeated.^[Wright, 2/55B]
For example,

<!--
(@) [إِذَا دُكَّتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ دَكًّا دَكَّا]{.ar}
is passive...
-->

Also for greater emphasis, the [maSdar]{.trn2} may be annexed to a pronoun referring to the doer of the verb.
For example,

(@) [ضَلَّ ضَلَالَهُ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/55B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He was in error (with) his error."  
    (i.e. "He was profoundly in error."

The reinforcing absolute doee, when used purely for emphasis and not also for other purposes, cannot be dualized or pluralized.
So we cannot say $times$\ [وَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا]{.ar}^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/211] ("I promised you promises").
Though, this sentence is correct for the purposes of the absolute doee, which we will lean in subsequent sections,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

## The qualifying absolute doee

With regard to the meaning of the governing verb, the qualifying absolute doee indicates either what kind it is, or its quantity, or both.

The kind of
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/54A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I beat him (with) a severe beating."

(@) [ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَ ٱلظَّالِمِ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/54B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He beat him (with) the beating of an oppressor."
