# The absolute doee

## Introduction

The absolute doee is, fundamentally, the verb taking it's own
[maSdar]{.trn2}
as a doee in the a-state.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

In the above example
[ضَرْبًا]{.ar}
is the 
[maSdar]{.trn2}
of the verb
[ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
and is governed by it in the a-state as its absolute doee.

This sort of sentence is unfamiliar in English,
as evinced by its awkward trabnslation,
"Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating."
Nevertheless, we can find some parallels so you can get a feel for it:

(@) 1. "He died an honorable death."
    2. "He slept the sleep of the just."
    3. "He lived two lives."

The absolute doee is somewhat different from the direct doee in that the direct doee only occurs for transitive verbs.
Whereas, the absolute doee can occur for any verb, whether transitive or intransitive.
Also, the absolute doee is effectively an adverb because it qualifies the meaning of the verb as we will learn in this chapter,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The absolute doee is used for the following purposes:

1. To reinforce or emphasize the meaning of the governing verb.
2. To qualify the meaning of the governing verb.
3. To act as a deputy for the governing verb, substituting it and fulfilling it's role.

## The reinforcing absolute doee

Reinforcing and emphasizing the meaning of the governing verb is the basic function of the absolute doee.
Consider again our earlier example:

(@) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا ضَرْبًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2} a beating"

The absolute doee [ضَرْبًا]{.ar} signifies that beating actually ocurred,
as if to
counter any possible suspicion that it didn't.
If the usage of the governing verb can support both a literal and a metaphorical meaning, then
the absolute doee can also signify that the meaning of the verb is literal, and not metaphorical.^[See [معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/194--195. But see also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-alqayyim/4/164> for [وكلم الله موسى تكليما]{.ar} and <https://tafsir.app/ibn-uthaymeen/27/50> for [ومكروا مكرًا ومكرنا مكرًا]{.ar}]

For greater emphasis, the [maSdar]{.trn2} may be repeated.^[Wright, 2/55B]
For example,

<!--
(@) [إِذَا دُكَّتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ دَكًّا دَكَّا]{.ar}
is passive...
-->

Also for greater emphasis, the [maSdar]{.trn2} may be annexed to a pronoun referring to the doer of the verb.
For example,

(@) [ضَلَّ ضَلَالَهُ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/55B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He erred (with) his error."  
    (i.e. "He was profoundly in error.")

The reinforcing absolute doee, when used purely for emphasis and not also for other purposes, cannot be dualized or pluralized.
So we cannot say $\times$\ [وَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا]{.ar} ("I promised you promises").^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/211]
Though, this sentence is correct for the other purposes of the absolute doee, which we will learn in subsequent sections,
if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

## The qualifying absolute doee

With regard to the meaning of the governing verb, the qualifying absolute doee indicates either what kind was intended, or its quantity, or both.

The qualifying absolute doee that indicates what kind of meaning was intended is frequently used with a describer or in an annexation.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/54A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I beat him (with) a severe beating."

(@) [ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبَ ٱلظَّالِمِ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/54B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He beat him (with) the beating of an oppressor."

The quantity of the action the verb frequenty uses the _one-time noun_ and it may be dualized or pluralized.
For example,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرَبْةً وَضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ أَوْ ضَرَبَاتٍ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, 2/53D]]{.ftsize}  
    "I beat him one blow and he beat me two blows or (three or more) blows."

Some [maSdar]{.trn2}s themselves end with a [ة]{.ar}, like [تِلَاوَة]{.ar},
so they are readily dualized or pluralized^[[[الكليات لأبي البقاء الكفوي]{.ar} 817](https://shamela.ws/book/7037/803)]
(to the sound [At]{.trn} plural)
without resorting to the one-time noun.
For example,

(@) [تَلَا ٱلْقَارِئُ تِلَاوَاتٍ]{.ar}  
    "The reader recited recitations."

But in reality, when a [maSdar]{.trn2} is dualized or pluralized in this manner,
it seems to leave its [maSdar]{.trn2} meaning,
which is purely a verbal meaning,
and begins to denote a concrete or abstract noun.^[[[دراسات في النحو لصلاح الدين الزعبلاوي]{.ar} 137](https://shamela.ws/book/2120/137#p1)]
So [تِلَاوَات]{.ar} will denote, not so much the actions of reciting but kinds of recitations.

The same goes for [maSdar]{.trn2}s that don't end with a [ة]{.ar} but for whom a broken plural has been recorded from Classical Arabic,
like
[عُلُوم]{.ar}, which is the plural of [عِلْم]{.ar} "knowledge",
and [وُعُود]{.ar} which is the plural of [وَعْد]{.ar} "promise".

So we can say:

(@) [وَعَدْتُكَ وُعُودًا]{.ar}  
    "I promised you promises."

[وُعُود]{.ar} here refers to different kinds or occasions of promises, rather than the purely verbal actions of promising.^[See also <https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/33/10> for [وتظنون بالله الظنونا]{.ar}]

Plurals have not been recorded for all [maSdar]{.trn2}s.
For example, [ضَرْب]{.ar} does not have a recorded plural for its [maSdar]{.trn2} meaning of "beating".

So can we pluralize it if we wish to say "I beat him (many) kinds of beatings"?
Some authorities allow us to form a new broken plural if there is a need.^[[[دراسات في النحو لصلاح الدين الزعبلاوي]{.ar} 139](https://shamela.ws/book/2120/139#p1)]
So according to them we should be able to 
coin a new plural
[ضُرُوب]{.ar}^[this plural already exists for [ضَرْب]{.ar} but for its other meaning "example"] "beatings"
and say,

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ ضُرُوبًا]{.ar}  
    "I beat him (many kinds of) beatings"

Other authorities are more conservative and would only allow using broken plurals for existing meanings of words if one has been recorded for them. Following this opinion, we might then say:

(@) [ضَرَبْتُهُ أَنْوَاعًا مِنَ ٱلضَّرْبِ]{.ar}  
    "I beat him (many) kinds of beatings"

In any case, any [maSdar]{.trn2} may at least be dualized to indicate the kinds of its action.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/212]
So we can say:

(@) [ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [[Wright 2/55D]]{.ftsize}  
    "He beat me two (kinds of) beatings."  
    or  
    "He beat me (on) two (occasions of) beatings."

By the way, you should be able to see that saying
[ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَيْنِ]{.ar}
is different from if we had said

(@) [ضَرَبَنِي ضَرْبَتَيْنِ]{.ar}  
    "He beat me (with) two blows."

The former signifies the kinds or occasions of beating
whereas the latter indicates the number of individual acts of beating.

By the way, for [maSdar]{.trn2}s that themselves end with [ة]{.ar},
if we wish to specify that the action ocurred only once,
we cannot, of course, form a one-time noun by appending another [ة]{.ar} to it.
In such a case, we may qualify the [maSdar]{.trn2} with the describer [وَاحِدَة]{.ar} "once".
For example:

(@) [رَحِمَهُ رَحْمَةً وَاحِدَةً]{.ar}
    [[Wright 1/123C]]{.ftsize}  
    "He had mercy upon him once."

It is also important to mention that the qualifying absolute doee includes the reinforcing meaning.^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/207--209]
We cannot use the qualifying absolute doee without also emphasizing the meaning of the verb.
For example,

(@) [فَٱصْبِرْ صَبْرًا جَمِيلًا]{.ar}
    [[<https://quran.com/70/5>]]{.ftsize}  
    "So be patient with gracious patience"

In section (ref), we will see that in order to only qualify the verb without emphasizing it, we can substitute the verb with the absolute doee which then becomes a _deputy to the verb_.^[[معاني النحو]{.ar} 2/203]

Finally, the qualifying absolute doee may qualify both the kinds and quantity of the meaning of the verb.
For example:

(@) [قَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ قِرَاءَتَيْنِ نَافِعَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/209]]{.ftsize}  
    "I read the book two useful readings."

## The deputy to the absolute doee

Frequently, instead of using the absolute doee directly,
it is substituted by another word.

(@) [ضربته شديدا]{.ar}

The [maSdar]{.trn2} may still figure in the expression. It will just not technically be the absolute doee, because the first a-state doee in that position is now its deputy.
For example,

When the [maSdar]{.trn2} is substituted with a describer, then the masculine adjectival noun will be used for the describer,
even if the [maSdar]{.trn2} was a feminine noun.
This is because even when
[maSdar]{.trn2}s
end with a feminine marker,
they are abstract enough in their meaning that when they are absent,
only the idea of them retains influence, not their actual wording.
And that abstract idea is not strongly feminine enough to cause the describer to match the wording of the [maSdar]{.trn2} in gender.
And so, by default, the masculine adjectival noun.


## Substituting the governing verb with the absolute doee as its deputy
