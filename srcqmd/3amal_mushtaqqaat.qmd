# The ;participle; as a verb-like governor

## Introduction

The verb is the basic, and strongest, governor of a ;faa3il; or ;maful;.
#;mushtaqq; nouns, because they are derived from the verb, can also govern in a verb-like manner.
In this chapter
we will discuss the rules of how such nouns may act as verb-like governors.

## The ;ism_fail; as a verb-like governor

The ;ism_fail; is the closest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns to the verb,
and thus the strongest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns in its capacity to act as a verb-like governor.

Consider the following sentence:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_yaqoomu) [زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- he stands]{.trans}

As we know from chapter\ (ref),
this is a compound sentence.
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} is the ;mubtada; of an outer sentence.
The ;xabar; of the outer sentence is the inner sentence
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}.

Instead of using the ;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar},
we can use its ;ism_fail;
[قَائِم]{.ar}, thus:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing]{.trans}

As you can see,
we have translated the ;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar} as [stands]{.trans}
and the ;ism_fail;
[قَائِم]{.ar} as [standing]{.trans}.
We will discuss the difference in meaning between the ;mudarie; verb and the ;ism_fail; in more detail in chapter\ (ref), ;ia;.
For now, we will focus on the grammar of the two sentences.

There is one notable similarity between the grammar of examples (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yaqoomu) and (@3amal_mush_zaydun_qaaimun),
and one notable difference:

##### The similarity {.unnumbered}

The
;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar},
and the ;ism_fail;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
both govern
a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun,
implicated as [[هُوَ]{.ar}].

##### The difference {.unnumbered}

The ;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
and its ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun 
[[هُوَ]{.ar}]
are complementary ;3umdah; elements that
constitute a complete sentence.
The 
;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun 
[[هُوَ]{.ar}]
is the ;muxbar3;
and
the ;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
is the ;muxbar;.
The sentence formed by
the ;mudarie; verb
[يَقُومُ]{.ar}
and its ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun 
[[هُوَ]{.ar}]
is in place of a ;ustate; noun as the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada;
([زَيْدٌ]{.ar})
of the outer sentence.

On the other hand,
and the ;ism_fail;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
and its
;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun 
[[هُوَ]{.ar}]
are _not_ complementary ;3umdah; elements.
Rather,
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar} (as the ;muxbar;)
and
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
(as the ;muxbar3;)
are complementary ;3umdah; elements.
This is a simple sentence,
not a compound sentence.
The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun
[[هُوَ]{.ar}] is not the ;3umdah; element of any sentence.
But,
despite being
;fadlah; from the perspective of sentence completion,
the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun
is an essential governee of the ;ism_fail;.

Let's take a look at another example:

(@) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [I saw a standing man.]{.trans}

The ;3umdah; elements of this sentence are 
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}: the verb [رَأَى]{.ar} and its ;faa3il; pronoun [تُ]{.ar}.
The entire phrase
[رَجُلًا قَائِمًا]{.ar} has only ;fadlah; elements.
[قَائِمًا]{.ar} is a ;na3t; of [رَجُلًا]{.ar}, governed by the verb [رَأَى]{.ar}.
The ;ism_fail;
[قَائِمًا]{.ar} has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun
[[هُوَ]{.ar}] that refers back to [رَجُلًا]{.ar}.
But because 
[قَائِمًا]{.ar} is a (;fadlah;) element of an existing sentence
(whose ;3umdah; elements are [رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}),
therefore it cannot be the ;3umdah; ;muxbar; of a new sentence with its ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun 
[[هُوَ]{.ar}].

So, as you can see, whenever the ;ism_fail; has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun,
that ;faa3il; pronoun is not the ;muxbar3; of any sentence.
This is because the ;ism_fail;, as a single element, is already a member of an existing sentence.

In contrast, a verb always forms a sentence (as the ;muxbar;) with its ;faa3il; (as the ;muxbar3;).
If we replace the ;ism_fail; [قَائِمًا]{.ar} with the verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar} thus:

(@) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا **يَقُومُ**]{.ar}  

then [يَقُومُ]{.ar} is a complete sentence with the verb and its ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun as ;3umdah; elements.
This complete sentence is the ;na3t; of [رَجُلًا]{.ar}.

## The ;ism_fail; as the governor of a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun

Let us look into the
;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun of the ;ism_fail; in more detail.
It makes sense for a verb to have a ;faa3il; but how can a noun have a ;faa3il;?
The reason is that the ;ism_fail;,
because of its closeness to the verb,
can act like one.
When acting with verbal force,
it can govern a ;faa3il;.
It can also, as we will see soon, ;ia;,
govern a ;mafulb;.

The ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail; is,
by default,
a ;mustatir; pronoun.
And it refers back to a referent that occurs before it.
In example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is the ;mustatir; pronoun [[هُوَ]{.ar}].
And the referent of this ;faa3il; pronoun is the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

DIAGRAM

Let's see another example:

(@) [صَاحَ الرَّجُلُ الْقَائِمُ]{.ar}  
    [The standing man shouted.]{.trans}

then [الْقَائِمُ]{.ar} governs a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هُوَ]{.ar}], that refers back to [الرَّجُلُ]{.ar}.

The fact that the ;ism_fail; has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun
is,
in fact,
the reason why a ;ism_fail; in the ;xabar; will match the ;mubtada; in gender.^[[Non-agreement of Mubtada and Khabar](https://drvaniya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Q33-Non-agreement-of-Mubtada-and-Khabar.pdf)]

For example, if we say:

(@) [هِنْدٌ قَائِمَةٌ]{.ar}  
    [Hind is standing.]{.trans}

then the feminine marker [ة]{.ar} is added to the ;ism_fail; [قَائِم]{.ar} only because it has to match the feminine gender of the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هِيَ]{.ar}] that occurs with, and is governed by, the ;ism_fail;.
(The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هِيَ]{.ar}] refers back to [هِنْد]{.ar}.)

When the referent of the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun changes for number or gender,
then the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun will change to match it.
For example:

(@3amal_mush_zaydaan_qaaimaan) [الزَّيْدَانِ قَائِمَانِ]{.ar}
    [[@sabban@ 1/291](https://shamela.ws/book/11539/288#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The two Zayds are standing.]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_zaydoon_qaaimoon) [الزَّيْدُونَ قَائِمُونَ]{.ar}
    [[@sabban@ 1/291](https://shamela.ws/book/11539/288#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Zayds are standing.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_mush_zaydaan_qaaimaan) above,
the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun of [قَائِمَانِ]{.ar} is implicated as [هُمَا]{.ar}.

And in example (@3amal_mush_zaydoon_qaaimoon) 
the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun of [قَائِمُونَ]{.ar} is implicated as [هُمْ]{.ar}.

As a point of technicality,
the alif in the dual suffix of [قَائِمَانِ]{.ar} and the [و]{.ar} in the plural suffix of [قَائِمُونَ]{.ar}, are not themselves the ;faa3il; pronouns.^[haazimi 30/5 <https://shamela.ws/book/36130/531>]
Rather, the ;faa3il; pronouns for the ;ism_fail;s above are ;mustatir;.

This is different than for verbs.
In the verbs
[يَقُومَانِ]{.ar} and [يَقُومُونَ]{.ar},
the alif in [انِ]{.ar} and the [و]{.ar} in [ونَ]{.ar} are, themselves, considered the ;faa3il; pronouns.
And these pronouns are _;zaahir;_, not ;mustatir;.

## The ;ism_fail; as the governor of a ;mafulb;

We have seen that the ;ism_fail;,
when acting with verbal force, governs a ;faa3il;.
In a similar manner,
the ;ism_fail; for transitive verbs can, optionally, govern a ;mafulb;.
In order to introduce this behavior,
we use again, as our starting point, the ;ustate; ;mudarie; verb.
Consider the following example:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd beats [#amr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

Example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_3amran) above is parsed as follows:

* [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} is a ;mubtada;.
* [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar} is a ;mudarie; verb in the ;ustate;.
  It governs a ;mustatir; pronoun (implicated as [هُوَ]{.ar}) in the ;ustate; as its ;faa3il;. 
  The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} refers back to its referent: the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
* [عَمْرًا]{.ar} is a ;mafulb;, governed in the ;astate; by  the verb [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}.
* [يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا]{.ar} is an inner sentence which is in place of a ;ustate; noun as the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

Instead of using the verb [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar} in example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_3amran) above
we may instead use its ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِب]{.ar}, thus:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is beating [#amr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

Example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_3amran) is parsed as follows:

* [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} is a ;mubtada;.
* [ضَارِبٌ]{.ar} is the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
  It governs a ;mustatir; pronoun (implicated as [هُوَ]{.ar}) in the ;ustate; as its ;faa3il;. 
  The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} refers back to the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
* [عَمْرًا]{.ar} is a ;mafulb;, governed in the ;astate; by the ;ism_fail; [ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}.

As you can see,
the ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar} can govern a ;mafulb; just like 
the verb [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}.

However, while a transitive verb can govern a ;mafulb; unconditionally,
a ;ism_fail; can only govern a ;mafulb; if certain conditions are satisfied.
We will discuss these conditions in section\ (ref) below.

By the way,
we again highlight the difference in
the ;faa3il; of
the verb [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
vs 
the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}:
The verb [يَضْرِبُ]{.ar} and its ;faa3il; are complementary ;3umdah; pairs that constitute a complete sentence.
Whereas,
the ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar} does not form a new sentence with its ;faa3il;.

### A ;ism_fail; defined by [ٱل]{.ar} as the governor of a ;mafulb;

Example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_3amran) shows the government of a ;mafulb; by an ;ism_fail; that is not defined by [ٱل]{.ar}.
In a similar manner,
an ;ism_fail; that _is_ defined by [ٱل]{.ar}, can also govern a ;mafulb;.
For example:

(@hadha_aldaaribu_zaydan) [هَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/84](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1448)]{.citex}  
    [This [person] is the beater of Zayd.]{.trans}

By the way, you my be wondering what is the difference between the sentence in example (@hadha_aldaaribu_zaydan) [هَذَا الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا]{.ar} above,
and if we had used an ;idaafah; thus:

(@hadha_aldaaribu_zaydan) [هَذَا ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [This [person] is the beater of Zayd.]{.trans}

This is touched upon in section\ (ma3aani_ism_faa3il).

### Word order of the ;mafulb; and its governing ;ism_fail;

As with verbs, the ;mafulb; usually follows its governing ;ism_fail;
(as in the examples above).
But 
when an ;ism_fail; is not prefixed by [ال]{.ar}, then its
;mafulb; is allowed to precede it.
So we can say:

(@) [هذا زيدا ضارب]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/259](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/257)]{.citex}  
    [This [person] is beating Zayd.]{.trans}

While the ;mafulb; is permitted 
to precede its governing ;ism_fail;
(as above),
it is very common,
in such a case,
for a ;laam_taqwiya; to be used with an ;indir_mafulb; instead, thus:

(@) [هذا لِزيدٍ ضارب]{.ar}  
    [This [person], to Zayd, is beating.]{.trans}

(@) [لِلضَّيْفِ مُكْرِمٌ]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 113]{.citex}  
    [to the guest, is honoring]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [honoring the guest]{.trans})  

The ;laam_taqwiya; is discussed in more detail in section\ (later chapter).^[See also @wright@ 2/69CD, @fischer@ §203 Note\ 2 p.\ 113 (who consider this ;laam_taqwiya; obligatory), and @nahw_wafi@ 2/475--476 (who doesn't consider it obligatory).]

Also,
the freedom for the governee of a ;ism_fail; to precede it is only given to the ;ism_fail; not prefixed by [ال]{.ar}.
When an ;ism_fail; is prefixed by [ال]{.ar}, then its
;mafulb; is not allowed to precede it.^[@nahw_wafi@ 3/263](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1489#p1)
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [هذا زيدا الضارب]{.ar}

We would have to say instead

(@) ;v; [هذا الضارب زيدا]{.ar}


TODO: Fronting the ;mafulb; is not permitted for ;sifah_mush;. See link in example above. Add to section on ;sifah_mush;

### A dual or plural ;ism_fail; as the governor of a ;mafulb;

A dual or plural ;ism_fail; may govern a ;mafulb; just like the singular.
So we can say:

(@) [هذان ضاربان زيدًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [These two [persons] are beating Zayd.]{.trans}

(@) [هم ضاربون زيدًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [These [persons] are beating Zayd.]{.trans}

(@) [الهندات ضاربات عمرا]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/439](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/437)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

#;ism_fail;s defined by [ٱل]{.ar} are again also permitted:

(@) [هذان الضاربان زيدا]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/40](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/538)]{.citex}  
    [These two are the beaters of Zayd.]{.trans}

(@) [هؤلاء الضاربون الرجل]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/40](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/538)]{.citex}  
    [These are the beaters of the man.]{.trans}

(@) [وَٱلۡمُقِیمِینَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَۚ وَٱلۡمُؤۡتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/4/162@ cited by [@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/40](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/538)]{.citex}  
    [And the establishers of prayer [especially] and the givers of zakāh]{.trans}

For plurals, the sound plurals are more worthy of being used as verb-like governors^[[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]
as in the examples above.
However, broken plurals are permitted as well.
So we can say:

(@) [الزيدون ضُرّابٌ عمرًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Zayds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [الهِنْداتُ ضواربُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

Flexible word order is again permitted for the dual and the plural as it was for the singular:

(@) [الزيدان عمرا ضاربان]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/439](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/437)]{.citex}  
    [The two Zayds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [الزيدون عَمْرًا ضُرّابٌ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Zayds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [الهندات عمرا ضاربات]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/439](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/437)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

(@) [الهِنْداتُ عَمْرًا ضواربُ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/97](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1461#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

## Conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern a ;mafulb;

As we mentioned above,
there are conditions that must be satisfied in order for an ;ism_fail; to be able to govern a ;mafulb; in this manner.
The conditions are different for when the ;ism_fail; is defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar},
and when it is not defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar}.
We will discuss each of these cases separately below:

### When the ;ism_fail; is not defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar}

When the ;ism_fail; is not defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar},
then two conditions must be satisfied:

1. The verbal aspect of the ;ism_fail; must be imperfect.
   That is, it must indicate an ongoing (whether present or past) or future action.
   Examples:

   * present ongoing:

     (@) [هذا ضارب زيدا الآن]{.ar}
         [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
         [This [person] is beating Zayd now.]{.trans}

   * past ongoing:

     (@) [كان زيد ضاربا عمرا]{.ar}
         [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/107]{.citex}  
         [Zayd was beating [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

     (@) [وَكَلْبُهُمْ بَاسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بَٱلْوَصِيدِ]{.quran}
         [@https://quran.com/18/18@ cited by @ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
         [while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance]{.trans}

   * future:

     (@) [هذا ضارب زيدا غَدًا]{.ar}
         [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
         [This [person] will beat Zayd tomorrow.]{.trans}

   If the verbal aspect indicated by the ;ism_fail; is perfect,
   then the ;ism_fail; may not govern a ;mafulb;.
   So, for example, we cannot say:

   (@) ;x; [هذا ضارب **زيدا** أمس]{.ar}
       [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
       [This [person] beat Zayd yesterday.]{.trans}

   If we desire to use the ;ism_fail;, then it will not have verbal force.
   And [زَيْد]{.ar} will have to be a ;mudafil; in a  ;idaafah;.
   Furthermore, this ;idaafah; will be _;ma3nawi;_ (see chapter\ (ref)).

   (@3amal_mush_hadha_daaribu_zaydin_amsi) [هذا ضارب زيد أمس]{.ar}
       [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
       [This [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.]{.trans}

   An exception is made for
   for transitive verbs that take more than one ;mafulb;,
   like [جعل]{.ar}, [أَعطى]{.ar}, etc.
   When the ;ism_fail; of such a verb is annexed to what would have been the first ;mafulb;,
   then second ;mafulb; is permitted to be in the ;astate;, 
   even if the aspect is perfect.^[See also @https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/35/1@ and @https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/35/1@]
   For example:
   
   (@) [هذا معطي زيد أمس درهما]{.ar}
       [[@ibn_malik_sharh_tasheel@ 3/78](https://shamela.ws/book/13257/894#p1)]{.citex}  
       [This [person] was the giver of Zayd, yesterday, a dirham.]{.trans}  

   
   Even the first ;mafulb; may remain in the ;astate;, if separated from the ;ism_fail;.
   For example:
   
   (@) [هذا ظان أمس زيدا فاضلا]{.ar}
       [[@ibn_malik_sharh_tasheel@ 3/78](https://shamela.ws/book/13257/894#p1)]{.citex}  
       [This [person] was the believer, yesterday, of Zayd as an eminent person.]{.trans}  

2. The second condition that should be satisfied is that the ;ism_fail; must have _;i3timaad;_.
   This ;i3timaad; can be provided by the following means:

   * The ;ism_fail; occurs after a ;adat_istifham;.
     Example:

     (@) [أضارب زيد عمرا]{.ar}
         [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/107]{.citex}  
         [Is Zayd beating [#eamr]{.trn2}?]{.trans}  

     (@) [هَلْ مُكْرِمٌ أَنْتَ زَيْدًا]{.ar}
         [@wright@ 2/65D]{.citex}  
         [Will you be treating Zayd with respect?]{.trans}  

   * The ;ism_fail; occurs after a ;nidaa; particle:
     Example:

     (@) [يا طالعا جبلا]{.ar}
         [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/107]{.citex}  
         [O scaler [of] a mountain!]{.trans}  

   * The ;ism_fail; occurs in a negation:
     Example:

     (@) [ما ضارب زيد عمرا]{.ar}

### When the ;ism_fail; is defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar}

When the ;ism_fail; is defined by [ٱلْ]{.ar},
then it is permitted to govern a ;mafulb; for a perfect or imperfect aspect.
<!--
So we can say:

(@) [هذا الضارب زيدا الآن أو غدا أو أمس]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/110]{.citex}  
    [This [person] is the beater of Zayd now/tomorrow/yesterday.]{.trans}
-->
Furthermore, no ;i3timaad; is required for it to be a governor,^[[@nahw_wafi@ 3/254](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1480)]
(as was required for the ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} in section\ (ref) above).

So we can say:

(@) [جاء الضارب زيداً أمسِ أو الآن أو غداً]{.ar}
    [[@sharh_shudhoor_aldhahab@ 2/683](https://shamela.ws/book/9134/666)]{.citex}  
    [The beater of Zayd came yesterday/today/tomorrow]{.trans}

## The ;ism_fail; as the governor of an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; pronoun

The ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun becomes ;zaahir; in some circumstances.
In this section,
we will discuss one such circumstance.
Consider the sentence:

(@) [الفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 1/463]{.citex}  

This grammar is parsed as follows:

* [الْفَارِسُ]{.ar} is the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence.
* [الْحِصَانُ]{.ar} is a second ;mubtada;. It is the ;mubtada; of the inner sentence.
* [مُتْبِع]{.ar} is the ;xabar; of the inner sentence. It is also a ;mudaf;.
* The pronoun [هُ]{.ar} is a ;mudafil;.
* The inner sentence [الْحِصَانُ مُتْبِعُهُ]{.ar} is the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; ([الْفَارِسُ]{.ar}) of outer sentence.

The ;xabar; of the inner sentence [مُتْبِع]{.ar} [one who makes tired]{.trans}
has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun, implicated as [[هُوَ]{.ar}].
It is possible for this ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun
to refer to either 
[الْفَارِسُ]{.ar}
or
[الْحِصَانُ]{.ar}.
Let's discuss both these meanings:

 i. If
    the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هُوَ]{.ar}] in
    [مُتْبِع]{.ar} refers to
    [الْحِصَانُ]{.ar}
    then the meaning is that
    [the horse makes the horseman tired]{.trans}.
    In this case, 
    the pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in [مُتْبِعُهُ]{.ar} refers to 
    [الْفَارِسُ]{.ar}.
    
ii. And if 
    the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هُوَ]{.ar}] in
    [مُتْبِع]{.ar} refers to
    [الْفَارِسُ]{.ar}
    then the meaning is that
    [the horseman makes the horse tired]{.trans}.
    In this case, 
    the pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in [مُتْبِعُهُ]{.ar} refers to 
    [الْحِصَانُ]{.ar}.

Both meanings are possible.

If only the second meaning is desired,
then the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هُوَ]{.ar}] can be made ;zaahir; and added after the ;ism_fail; [مُتْبِع]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [الفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه **هُوَ**]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 1/464]{.citex}  
    [The horseman -- the horse -- [he] makes him tired.]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [The horseman makes the horse tired.]{.trans})

Now only the second meaning is possible.
If the first meaning is desired, the ;faa3il; pronoun of 
[مُتْبِع]{.ar}
must stay ;mustatir; and the ambiguity will remain.

By the way, the ambiguity arose in the original sentence
([الفارس الحصانُ مُتْعِبُه]{.ar})
only because both ;mubtada;s
([الْفَارِسُ]{.ar}
and
[الْحِصَانُ]{.ar})
are singular masculine nouns.
If the two ;mubtada;s are distinguishable in number or gender then there will be no ambiguity.
However, even in this case,
according to some grammarians,
if the ;xabar; is to refer to the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence,
then the ;faa3il; pronoun of the ;ism_fail; in the ;xabar; should be made ;zaahir;.
For example:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_hindun_daaribuhaa_huwa) [زَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا **هُوَ**]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/207](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/206#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- Hind -- [he] is beating her.]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [Zayd is beating Hind.]{.trans})

But according to other grammarians, 
because [ضَارِب]{.ar} can refer only to Zayd and not to Hind,
the ;ism_fail;'s ;faa3il; pronoun can remain latent,^[[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/207](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/206#p1)] thus:

(@) [زَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا]{.ar}   
    [Zayd -- Hind -- [he] is beating her.]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [Zayd is beating Hind.]{.trans})

<!--
(@) [زَيْدٌ عَمْرٌو ضَارِبُهُ]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/208]{.citex}  

This sentence can have two different meanings:

 i. [Zayd -- [#eamr]{.trn2} beats him]{.trans}
ii. [Zayd -- [#eamr]{.trn2} beats him]{.trans}
-->

## The ;sababi; ;xabar;

<!--
[Zayd beats [#amr]{.trn2}]{.trans}
-->

Consider again example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}.
From this original sentence, we replaced the verb 
[يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
with its ;ism_fail; and came up with
(@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}.

Now consider the following example:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_aboohu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- his father beats [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_aboohu_3amran) above
the ;faa3il; of 
[يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
is not Zayd but Zayd's father.
If we use this sentence as our starting point,
we can again replace the verb
[يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
with its ;ism_fail; 
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}
and say:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_aboohu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- his father is beating [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

[أَبُوهُ]{.ar} is the (;zaahir;) ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}.
And [عَمْرًا]{.ar} is its ;mafulb;.
So just like a verb can have an ;zaahir; noun as its ;faa3il; instead of a ;mustatir; pronoun,
so too can the ;ism_fail; have an ;zaahir; noun as its ;faa3il; instead of a ;mustatir; pronoun.

Again, there is one important difference between using the verb
[يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
vs using its ;ism_fail; 
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}.
And that is that 
[يَضْرِبُ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
in example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_aboohu_3amran)
is a complete sentence.
This inner sentence is the ;xabar; of the outer sentence.
Therefore, example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_yadribu_aboohu_3amran) is a compound sentence.

However,
[ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
in example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_aboohu_3amran) 
is not a complete sentence.
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}
itself, as a single word, is the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.^[[@taftazani_mukhtasar_maani@ 86](https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/16360/read?part=1&page=82&index=72272/72275)]
So example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_aboohu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is not a compound sentence.

<!--
In example () it is an inner sentence as the ;xabar; of the outer sentence.
Therefore () zaydun yaDrib abuuhu 3amran is a compound sentence.
But DAribun abuuhu 3amran is not a complete sentence by itself.
Rather DAribun comprises the ;xabar; as a single word.^[subki, mukhtasar al-ma3aani lil-taftaazaani 86]
So () zaydun DAribun aBuuhu 3amran is not a compound sentence.
-->

The ;xabar; [ضَارِبٌ]{.ar} in example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_aboohu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
is called a ;sababi; ;xabar;.^[[[الخبر السببي لوجيهة السطل]{.ar}](https://alababmisr.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%84/); [@suyooti_ashbaah@ 4/287](https://lib.eshia.ir/71585/4/287)]
A ;mushtaqq; noun is termed _;sababi;_ when it governs a ;faa3il; which is annexed to a pronoun that refers back to the original referent of the ;mushtaqq; noun.^[[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 4/404](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/2393) (also cited by @su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 161)]
In our example, the
;mushtaqq; noun [ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}
governs a ;faa3il;
[أَب]{.ar}
which is annexed to a pronoun [هُ]{.ar}
that refers back to the original referent of the ;mushtaqq; noun,
the ;mubtada;
[زَيْد]{.ar}.


<!--
This can be made clear by looking at the following example:

(@) kaana zaydun muntaliqan

-->

### Varying the number or gender of the ;zaahir; ;faa3il; of the ;sababi; ;xabar;

Here is another example of a sentence with a ;sababi; ;xabar;:

(@3amal_mush_kaana_zaydun_muntaliqan_aboohu) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقًا أَبُوهُ]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 208]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father was setting out.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_mush_kaana_zaydun_muntaliqan_aboohu) 
above,
[مُنْطَلِقًا]{.ar} is the ;sababi; ;xabar; of [كَانَ]{.ar}.
The ;zaahir; ;faa3il; of the [مُنْطَلِقًا]{.ar} is the singular masculine noun [أَبُوه]{.ar} [his father]{.trans}.

Let's see what happens when
we vary the number or gender of this ;zaahir; ;faa3il; of the ;sababi; ;xabar;.

(@3amal_mush_kaana_alzaydaani_muntaliqan_abawaahuma) [كَانَ الزَيْدَانِ **مُنْطَلِقًا** أَبَوَاهُمَا]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 208]{.citex}  
    [The two Zayds -- their fathers were setting out.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_mush_kaana_alzaydaani_muntaliqan_abawaahuma) above,
the ;sababi; ;xabar; 
[مُنْطَلِقًا]{.ar}
remains in the singular, 
even though its ;faa3il; is the dual
[أَبَوَاهُمَا]{.ar}.

This is analagous to a verb, which remains in the singular for dual and plural ;faa3il;s.
For example
[كَانَ الزَيْدَانِ **يَنْطَلِقُ** أَبَوَاهُمَا]{.ar}, etc.

If the gender of the ;ism_fail;'s ;faa3il; is feminine,
then the ;ism_fail; remains in the singular but it is feminized.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ **مُنْطَلِقَةٌ** أُمُّهُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- his mother is setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [كَانَتْ هِنْدٌ **مُنْطَلِقَةً** خَالَتَاهَا]{.ar}  
    [Hind -- her two maternal aunts were setting out.]{.trans}

This again is analagous to the feminizing a verb that has a feminine ;faa3il;.

If the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail; is a plural, then we have an choice:

If the ;ism_fail; has a sound plural, then, again, it is not used and the ;ism_fail; remains in the singular.
For example:

(@) [كَانَ الزَيْدُونَ **مُنْطَلِقًا** آبَاؤُهُمْ]{.ar}  
    [The Zayds -- their fathers were setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [زَيْدٌ **مُنْطَلِقَةٌ** خَالَاتُهُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd -- his maternal aunts are setting out.]{.trans}

But if
the ;ism_fail; has a broken plural, then it is allowed to be used, and is indeed preferred,^[@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 693--694 cited by @peled_sentence_types@ 208 (footnote)]
when the ;faa3il; is a plural.

For example:

(@) [كَانَ الزَّيْدُونَ **قِيَامًا** آبَاؤُهُمْ]{.ar}  
    [The Zayds -- their fathers were standing]{.trans}

Here are some examples of ;sababi; ;xabar;s from the [#qurEAn]{.trn2}:

(@3amal_mush_aathimun_qalbuhu) [فَإِنَّهُۥۤ **ءَاثِمࣱ** قَلۡبُهُۥۗ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/2/283@]{.citex}  
    [his heart is indeed sinful]{.trans}  
    (Other analyses besides a ;sababi; ;xabar; are also possible.^[@https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/2/283@] One such differing analysis is discussed in section\ (ref) below.)

(@) [وَظَنُّوۤا۟ أَنَّهُم **مَّانِعَتُهُمۡ** حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/59/2@]{.citex}  
    [and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh]{.trans}  
    (Another analysis is also possible: [حُصُونُهُمْ]{.ar} can be a ;mubtada;, and [مَانِعَتُهُمْ]{.ar} is its fronted ;xabar;.^[@https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/59/2@])

### Word order of the ;faa3il; and the ;mafulb; in a ;sababi; ;xabar;

If the ;ism_fail; is transitive, then the normal word order is ;ism_fail;, ;faa3il;, ;mafulb;.
For example:

(@) [هَذَا ضَارب أَبوهُ زيدا]{.ar}
    [@suyooti_hama3@ 3/89]{.citex}  
    [This [person] -- his father is beating Zayd.]{.trans}  

But the ;mafulb; can be made to precede the ;faa3il; thus:

(@) [هذا ضارب زيدا أبوه]{.ar}
    [[@sabban@ 2/453](https://shamela.ws/book/11539/883)]{.citex}  
    [This [person] -- his father is beating Zayd.]{.trans}  

## The ;sababi; ;na3t;

In section\ (ref) above we have seen how a ;ism_fail; can govern a ;zaahir; ;faa3il; when it is a ;sababi; ;xabar;.
In a similar manner,
a ;ism_fail; can govern a ;zaahir; ;faa3il; when it is a ;sababi; ;na3t;.

Consider the following example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}  
    [I passed by a man whose father is setting out]{.trans}

The ;ism_fail; 
[مُنْطَلِقٍ]{.ar}
is a ;na3t; of the ;manut;
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar}.
Because it is a ;sababi; ;na3t;,
it has a ;faa3il;
[أَب]{.ar}
that is annexed to a pronoun
[هُ]{.ar}
which refers to the ;manut;
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar}.

We know that,
in general,
a ;na3t; will match its ;manut; in four aspects:

  i. state
 ii. definiteness
iii. gender
 iv. number (singular/dual/plural)

The ;sababi; ;na3t; will also match its preceding ;manut;
in state and definiteness.
(You can see the ;na3t;
[مُنْطَلِقٍ]{.ar}
matches its ;manut;
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar}
in the ;istate; and in being indefinite.)
But in matching gender and number the ;sababi; ;na3t; has different rules.
Consistent with we learned for the ;sababi; ;xabar; above,
the ;sababi; ;na3t; will, in general, always be singular,
and it will match its ;faa3il; in gender.
Here are some examples that show different combinations:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِالرَّجُلِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}  
    [I passed by the man whose father is setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ أَخَوَاهُ]{.ar}  
    [I passed by a man whose two brothers are setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [رَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا مُنْطَلِقًا آبَاؤُهُمْ]{.ar}  
    [I saw men whose fathers are setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْطَلِقَةً أُمُّهُ]{.ar}  
    [I saw a man whose mother is setting out.]{.trans}

(@) [جَاءَنِي زَيْدٌ الْمُنْطَلِقَةُ أَخَوَاتُهُ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd whose sisters are setting out came to me.]{.trans}

(@) [جَاءَتْنِي امْرَأَةٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ أَبُوهَا]{.ar}  
    [A woman whose father is setting out came to me.]{.trans}

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِالْمَرْأَةِ الْمُنْطَلِقِ أَخَوَاهَا]{.ar}  
    [I passed by the woman whose two brothers are setting out.]{.trans}

The above examples use the ;ism_fail;
[مُنْطَلِق]{.ar}
which only has sound plurals.
Therefore it remains in the singular.
If an ;ism_fail; has a broken plural, it is permitted (and in fact preferred) to use the broken plural for a plural ;faa3il;.^[[@sharh_qatr_alnada@ 288](https://shamela.ws/book/6970/263); @nahw_wafi@ 3/453--454]

When the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail; is ;zaahir; then it will often be a ;sababi; ;faa3il;,
as we have seen in sections\ (sababi-xabar) and (sababi-na3t) above.
However, it is also possible for the ;ism_fail; to govern a non-;sababi; ;zaahir; ;faa3il;.
For example:

(@) [مررت برجل متكلمٍ محمدٌ في داره]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1075]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man [whom] [#muHammad]{.trn2} was speaking in his house.]{.ar}

In the example above
[محمد]{.ar}
is the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail;
[متكلم]{.ar}.
But because it is not annexed to a pronoun which refers back to
[رجل]{.ar},
therefore it is not a ;sababi; ;faa3il;.

## Conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern a ;faa3il;

In section\ (ref) above,
we discussed the
conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern a ;mafulb;.
Correspondingly, there exist
conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern a ;faa3il;.

The ;ism_fail; can have either an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; (either as a noun or as a pronoun),
or a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.
We will treat each of these separately below:

### Conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern an ;zaahir; ;faa3il;

The grammarians differed with regard to the
conditions under which the ;ism_fail; is allowed to govern an ;zaahir; ;faa3il;.
According to some, the same conditions are applicable as for governing a ;mafulb;,
namely that 
when an ;ism_fail; is not defined by [ٱل]{.ar},
then
it can only govern an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; when 

 i. It has an imperfect aspect.
ii. It has ;i3timaad;

So it is not allowed to govern an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; for a perfect aspect.
The following example would then be disallowed:

(@) ;x; [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ أَمْسِ]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 134]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father stood yesterday.]{.trans}

Other grammarians, however, allowed such a sentence.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 134]

when an ;ism_fail; is defined by [ٱل]{.ar},
then
it can only govern an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; unconditionally.
So it can govern with perfective aspect and without ;i3timaad;.
Examples:

(@) [جاءني القائم أبوه]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 1/449](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/449)]{.citex}  
    [The one whose father is standing came.]{.trans}  

(@) [القائم أبوه ضاحك]{.ar}
    [[@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 3/257](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/917#p1)]{.citex}  
    [The one whose father is standing is laughing.]{.trans}  

(@) [جاء الضارب أبوه زيدًا أمس]{.ar}
    [[@sharh_ibn_naazim_alfiyyah@ 59](https://shamela.ws/book/18115/57)]{.citex}  
    [The one whose father beat Zayd yesterday came.]{.trans}  



### Conditions for the ;ism_fail; to govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun

As a default,
the ;ism_fail; requires
a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.
So it governs
a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun unconditionally, except when it is prevented from doing so because of one of the following situations:

#### The ;ism_fail; is already governing an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; noun {.unnumbered}

If the ;ism_fail; is already governing an ;zaahir; ;faa3il;,
then it will not also have a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.
This is because one ;ism_fail; cannot have two ;faa3il;s.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 139]
Example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 139]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- his father is standing]{.trans}

Beware though, that sometimes it may appear that an ;ism_fail; is governing an ;zaahir; ;faa3il;,
but actually another interpretation may also be possible.
Consider the following ;ayah; that we discussed in section\ (ref) above:

(@3amal_mush_aathimun_qalbuhu) [فَإِنَّهُۥۤ **ءَاثِمࣱ** قَلۡبُهُۥۗ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/2/283@]{.citex}  
    [his heart is indeed sinful]{.trans}

We had discussed this as a case of a ;sababi; ;xabar;.
But another analysis is also possible:
The ;ism_fail; [آثِمٌ]{.ar} is governing a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun, and
[قَلْبُهُ]{.ar} is a ;badal; for the ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.^[@https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/2/283@]

#### The ;ism_fail; is already governing an ;zaahir; ;faa3il; pronoun {.unnumbered}

We discussed in section\ (ref) above, a situation in which the originally ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun of a ;ism_fail; becomes ;zaahir;.
Because the ;faa3il; is now ;zaahir; the ;ism_fail; will not govern an additional ;mustatir; ;faa3il;.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 144]

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_hindun_daaribuhaa_huwa) [زَيْدٌ هِنْدٌ ضَارِبُهَا هُوَ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/207](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/206#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Zayd -- Hind -- [he] is beating her.]{.trans}  
    (i.e. [Zayd is beating Hind.]{.trans})

<!--
#### The ;ism_fail; is the ;mudaf; in a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah; {.unnumbered}

When ;ism_fail; is the ;mudaf; in a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;,
then it will not govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 142]
This can happen when the ;ism_fail; indicates a perfective aspect.
We saw an example of this in the conditions for governing a ;mafulb; above:

@3amal_mush_hadha_daaribu_zaydin_amsi) [هذا ضارب زيد أمس]{.ar}
   [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/106]{.citex}  
   [This [person] was the beater of Zayd yesterday.]{.trans}

By the way, this does not mean that the ;ism_fail; cannot govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun whenever it signifies a perfective aspect.
It only cannot do so in a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
So ;ism_fail; will govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun when it has a perfective aspect, but no ;idaafah;.
For example:

@) [هذا ضاربٌ أمس]{.ar}  
   [This [person] was a beater yesterday.]{.trans}

#### The ;ism_fail; does not have verbal force {.unnumbered}

When the ;ism_fail; does not verbal force, then it does not govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.^[See citations in @su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 154].
For example:

(@) [قَامَ **عَاقِلٌ** مِنْ بَنِي فُلَانٍ]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 154]{.citex}  
    [An intelligent one from [such-and-such tribe] stood up.]{.trans}

#### Multiple ;ism_fail;s refer to the same referent {.unnumbered}

When there are multiple ;ism_fail;s that occur together and that refer to the same referent,
then only the first will have a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun and not the subsequent ones.
For example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ قَائِمٍ لَا قَاعِدٍ]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 156]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a standing, not a sitting, man.]{.trans}
-->

## #;lafzi; ;idaafah;

#### #;lafzi; ;idaafah; used to eliminate ;tanwin; {.unnumbered}

Consider again the sentence:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    [zaydun DAribun 3amran]{.trn}  
    [Zayd is beating [#amr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

The ;ism_fail; 
[ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}
has a ;tanwin; which is pronounced before pronouncing the ;mafulb;
[عَمْرًا]{.ar}.
In an effort to make the pronunciation easier, this ;tanwin; is often eliminated and replaced with an ;idaafah;.
The ;mafulb; is then made into a ;mudafil; in the ;istate;.
The meaning remains the same.
So the above sentence then becomes:

(@) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}  
    [zaydun DAribu 3amrin]{.trn}  
    [Zayd is beating [#amr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

This is called a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;, 
as opposed to a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;,
which is what we have been studying so far.
This is because it is only an ;idaafah; for the purposes of easing the pronunciation,
not in meaning.

Regarding terminology,
[عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
syntactically
becomes a ;mudafil; in the ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.
But in meaning, it is still the ;mafulb; of the ;ism_fail;
[ضَارِب]{.ar}.
We will refer to it as the _semantic ;mafulb;_.

By the way, the sentence
[زَيْدٌ ضَارِبُ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
can also be a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
In which case, the meaning will be:
[Zayd is the beater of [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}.
So if we come across such a sentence, how can we tell if it is a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah; or a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;?
The answer is, in this case, context should guide us.
We will see below that the ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is not always identical in form to the ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
So in those cases, the form of the ;idaafah; will tell us whether 
it is a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah; or a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.

Here are some more examples of a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; used to eliminate a ;tanwin;:

(@) [الْهِنْدَاتُ ضارباتُ عمرٍو]{.ar}
    [modified from [@azhari_sharh_tasreeh@ 1/682](https://shamela.ws/book/9985/694)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}  
    (instead of [ضارباتٌ عمرًا]{.ar})

When the ;ism_fail; is a ;diptote;, it will not have a ;tanwin;.
But the ;lafzi; ;idaafah; may still be used in such a case because a ;tanwin; would have been present if the word were ;triptote;.^[[@azhari_sharh_tasreeh@ 1/682](https://shamela.ws/book/9985/694)]
For example:

(@) [الْهِنْدَاتُ ضواربُ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [modified from [@azhari_sharh_tasreeh@ 1/682](https://shamela.ws/book/9985/694)]{.citex}  
    [The Hinds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}  
    (instead of [ضواربُ عمرًا]{.ar})

#### #;lafzi; ;idaafah; used to eliminate the [ن]{.ar} of a dual or plural suffix {.unnumbered}

The ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is used in situations when the governing ;ism_fail; has ;tanwin; (as above),
and also in situations when it ends with a [ن]{.ar} arising from a dual or sound plural.
Examples:

(@) [الزَّيْدَانِ ضاربا عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [modified from [@azhari_sharh_tasreeh@ 1/682](https://shamela.ws/book/9985/694)]{.citex}  
    [The [two] Zayds are beating [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}  
    (instead of [ضاربانِ عَمْرًا]{.ar})

#### Definiteness of the ;lafzi; ;idaafah; {.unnumbered}

Because this is a ;lafzi; and not a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;,
the ;mudaf; 
is not made definite  by a definite ;mudafil;.
In the examples so far, the ;mudafil;s have been proper nouns 
([زَيْد]{.ar}, [عَمْرو]{.ar})
which are definite.
But the ;ism_fail;s
([ضَارِب]{.ar},
[ضَارِبَا]{.ar},
etc.)
remain indefinite, because they did not originally have [ٱل]{.ar} when governing a ;mafulb;.
This example proves the above claim:

(@3amal_mush_hadyan_baaligha_lka3bati) [هَدۡیَۢا بَـٰلِغَ ٱلۡكَعۡبَةِ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/5/95@ cited by [@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/84](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1448)]{.citex}  
    [as an offering [to Allāh] delivered to the Kaʿbah]{.trans}

In  example (@3amal_mush_hadyan_baaligha_lka3bati) above,
the ;ism_fail;
[بَالِغ]{.ar} is a ;mudaf; to the definite ;mudafil; [الْكَعْبَة]{.ar}.
But this is a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;. So
[بَالِغ]{.ar}
does not become definite.
Therefore 
[بَالِغ]{.ar}
can be a ;na3t; to the indefinite 
[هَدْيًا]{.ar}.

If the ;ism_fail; is to be made definite in a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; then a [ٱل]{.ar} is added to it.
For example:

(@) [هذان الضاربا زيدٍ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/132](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/582#p1)]{.citex}  
    [These two are the beaters of Zayd.]{.trans}  
    (instead of [هذان الضاربان زيدًا]{.ar})

(@) [وَٱلۡمُقِیمِی ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/22/35@ cited by [@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/132](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/582#p1)]{.citex}  
    [and the establishers of prayer]{.trans}

Adding [ٱل]{.ar} to the ;mudaf; is particular to a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.
As we know, it is not permitted in a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
So when we see
[ٱل]{.ar} with a ;mudaf;, then we will know that the ;idaafah; has to be a ;lafzi; one.

#### When the ;ism_fail; does not have ;tanwin; or a suffixed [ن]{.ar} {.unnumbered}

Consider the following case of a ;ism_fail; governing a ;mafulb;:

(@) [الضَّارِبُ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    [the beater of Zayd]{.trans}  

There is no ;tanwin; of suffixed [ن]{.ar} after the ;ism_fail;.
Therefore, a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is not permitted, and we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [الضَّارِبُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/132](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/582#p1)]{.citex}  

The following are similarly not permitted:

(@) ;x; [الضارب رجلٍ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/47](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/726)]{.citex}  
    [the beater of the man]{.trans}  

(@) ;x; [الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/66B]{.citex}
    [the beater of the slave of Zayd]{.trans}  

(@) ;x; [الضَّارِبُ عَبْدِهِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/66B]{.citex}
    [the beater of his slave]{.trans}  

If, however, the ;mafulb; is defined by [ٱل]{.ar},
or is itself a ;mudaf; to a ;mudafil;
that is defined by [ٱل]{.ar},
then,
as an exception,
the ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is again permitted.^[@wright@ 2/66A]
For example:

(@) [الضَّارِبُ الْعَبْدِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/66A]{.citex}  
    [the beater of the slave]{.trans}  

(@) [الضَّارِبُ رَأْسِ الْعَبْدِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/66A]{.citex}  
    [the beater of the head of the slave]{.trans}  

<!--
We will also see in section\ (ref), ;ia;, that when the governor is used with a ;sifah; meaning,
then too such a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is permitted.^[[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/132--133](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/582#p1)]
For example:
-->

#### Two or more ;mafulb;s connected by [وَ]{.ar} or [أَوْ]{.ar} {.unnumbered}

When a ;ism_fail; governs two or more ;mafulb;s connected by [وَ]{.ar} or [أَوْ]{.ar}
then, if the first is in a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; then the second may either be in the ;istate; or the ;astate;.
For example

(@) [هذا ضاربُ زيدٍ وعمرٍو/وعمرًا]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 4/81](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/1445)]{.citex}  
    [This [person] is beating Zayd and [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}  

By the way, if the first ;mafulb; is in the ;astate;, then it is not an ;idaafah; and the second ;mafulb; would follow in the ;astate;.

(@) [هذا ضاربٌ زيدًا وعمرًا]{.ar}  
    [This [person] is beating Zayd and [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}  

#### #;lafzi; ;idaafah; with a ;zaahir; ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

Consider an ;ism_fail; that has a ;zaahir; ;faa3il; and is governing a ;mafulb; thus:

<!--
(@) [هَذَا ضَارب أَبوهُ زيدا]{.ar}
    [@suyooti_hama3@ 3/89]{.citex}  
    [This [person] -- his father is beating Zayd.]{.trans}  
-->

(@) [مررت برجل ضارب أبوه زيدا]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/458](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/956)]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.]{.trans}  

If we wish to use a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;, then the ;ism_fail; can only be annexed to its ;mafulb; and not to its ;faa3il;.
So we can say:

(@) [مررت برجل ضارب زيد أبوه]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/74](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/572)]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a man whose father [was] beating Zayd.]{.trans}  
    (Remember from section\ (ref) above that the word order [ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا أَبُوهُ]{.ar} is permissible.)
   
We cannot say:

(@) ;x; [مررت برجل ضارب أَبِيهِ زيدا]{.ar}
    [[@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 10/359](https://shamela.ws/book/17116/3534)]{.citex}

## The ;ism_fail; with a pronoun as its ;mafulb;

When the ;ism_fail; governs a ;mafulb; that is a pronoun,
there is considerable variation seen

One possibility is is to separate the ;ism_fail; from its ;maful; pronoun using the prefix [إِيَّا]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [ضَارِبٌ إِيَّاكَ]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 2/434]{.citex}  
    [beating you]{.trans}  

(@) [الضَارِبُ إِيَّاكَ]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 2/434]{.citex}  
    [the beater of you]{.trans}  

(@) [الضَارِبُونَ إِيَّاهُ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/67A]{.citex}  
    [the beaters of me]{.trans}  

The second possibility, and by far the more common usage, is to use a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;, thus:

(@) [ضَارِبُكَ]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 2/434]{.citex}  
    [beating you]{.trans}  

(@) [الضَارِبُكَ]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 2/434]{.citex}  
    [the beater of you]{.trans}  

(@) [الضارِبِي]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/135](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/585#p1)]{.citex}  
    [the beater of me]{.trans}

(@) [الضارباتِي]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/135](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/585#p1)]{.citex}  
    [the beaters~f~ of me]{.trans}

When the ;ism_fail; has a ;zaahir; ;faa3il;, then it will follow the attached pronoun, thus:

(@) [هَذَا ضَارِبِي أَبُوهُ]{.ar}  
    [This [person] -- his father is beating me.]{.trans}  

For the dual and sound [Un]{.trn} plural in a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;, the [ن]{.ar} of the suffix is regularly deleted.
So we will say:

(@) [هذان ضارباك]{.ar}
    [[@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/196](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/194)]{.citex}  
    [These two are beating you.]{.trans}  
    (from [ضاربان]{.ar})

    [the beaters of me]{.trans}  
    (from [الضاربِين]{.ar} and [الضاربون]{.ar})

Occasionally
a [ن]{.ar} is inserted
between the ;ism_fail; ;mudaf;
and the pronoun ;mudafil;.
This would permit words like:
[ضَارِبُنِي]{.ar},
[الضَّارِبُونِي]{.ar},
etc.
For example:

It seems that this usage did not make its way to Standard Classical Arabic.
But some grammarians permit this usage
by poetic license,
or as a rare usage.^[See for more details [@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/44](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/542); [@nahw_wafi@ 1/285](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/284); [@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 2/137](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/587#p1); @wright@ 2/67AB]

## The ;faa3il; of a ;mushtaqq; noun that fulfils the role of the ;xabar;

In our discussion of the ;faa3il; of ;mushtaqq; nouns,
we have consistently stated that the ;faa3il; of a ;mushtaqq; noun is not a ;3umdah; element.
This is because the ;mushtaqq; noun, which has a ;faa3il;, is typically already part of an existing sentence.
See example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_daaribun_aboohu_3amran) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ أَبُوهُ عَمْرًا]{.ar} above.

However, there is one special kind of sentence where 
that the ;faa3il; of a ;mushtaqq; noun _is_ a ;3umdah; element.

Before presenting this special 
_;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar;_
sentence,
we will first give some background.
Consider the sentence:

(@3amal_mush_zaydun_qaaimun2) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

In example (@3amal_mush_zaydun_qaaimun2) above,
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the ;mubtada;
and
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is its ;xabar;.

We can rearrange the word order to front the ;xabar; thus:

(@3amal_mush_qaaimun_zaydun) [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Standing, Zayd is.]{.trans}

This fronted ;xabar; will be common in negative and question sentences.
For example:

(@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) [أَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/257B]{.citex}  
    [Is Zayd standing?]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_maa_qaaimun_zaydun) [مَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/257B]{.citex}  
    [Hind is not going]{.trans}

Now we come to the special
;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar;
sentence:

In negative and question sentences like
examples (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) and (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) above,
the ;mushtaqq; noun can be analyzed as a ;mubtada;,
and its following ;faa3il; will fulfil the role of the ;xabar;.

So,
in examples (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) and (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) above,
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
can be considered a ;mubtada;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
and can be its ;faa3il; that fulfils the role of the ;xabar;.
Now, you might be thinking:
what is the reason for this strange
;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar;
analysis?

Why can't we just consider
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
a fronted ;xabar; and 
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
the backed ;mubtada;?

The answer is that we can indeed
consider
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
a fronted ;xabar; and 
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
the backed ;mubtada; as one option.
But, as another option,
the
;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar;
analysis allows us to keep the ;mushtaqq; noun in the singular for dual and plural subjects.
So we can say:

(@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_alzaydaani) [أَقَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    [Are the two Zayds standing?]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_maa_qaaimun_alhindaatu) [مَا ذَاهِبَةٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ]{.ar}  
    [The Hinds are not going]{.trans}

Sentences (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_alzaydaani) and (@3amal_mush_maa_qaaimun_alhindaatu) are legitimate, but are only permitted for negative and question sentences.^[Some grammarians did not require this condition based on the sentence [خَبِيرٌ بَنُو لِهْبٍ]{.ar}. For details on the dispute, see [@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@\ 1/191 footnote 3](https://shamela.ws/book/11825/193#p1).]
If it is not a negative or question sentence, then
the
;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar;
construction is not permitted.
So the following are not correct as complete sentences:

(@3amal_mush_qaaimun_alzaydaani) ;x; [قَائِمٌ الزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    [The two Zayds are standing.]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_qaaimatun_alhindaatu) ;x; [ذَاهِبَةٌ  الْهِنْدَاتُ]{.ar}  
    [The Hinds are going]{.trans}

This is because the ;mushtaqq; noun
[قَائِم]{.ar}
cannot govern the ;zaahir; ;faa3il;s
[الزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}
and
[الْهِنْدَاتُ]{.ar}
without the ;i3timaad; that is provided by being in a negative or question sentence.

So when it is not a negative or question sentence, then only the fronted ;xabar; construction is permitted and the ;xabar; will typically match the backed ;mubtada; in number and gender. For example:

(@3amal_mush_qaaimaani_alzaydaani) [قَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    [Standing, the two Zayds are.]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_qaaimun_alhindaatu) [ذَاهِبَاتٌ  الْهِنْدَاتُ]{.ar}  
    [Going, the Hinds are.]{.trans}

The fronted ;xabar; construction is also permitted, as an option, even for negative and question sentences.
For example:

(@3amal_mush_aqaaimaani_alzaydaani) [أَقَائِمَانِ الزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    [Are the two Zayds standing?]{.trans}

(@3amal_mush_maa_qaaimun_alhindaatu) [مَا ذَاهِبَاتٌ الْهِنْدَاتُ]{.ar}  
    [The Hinds are not going]{.trans}

When the ;mushtaqq; noun and the ;faa3il; are both singular, and it is a negative or question sentence,
then a double analysis is possible^[@wright@ 2/258A]:

 i. the fronted ;xabar; analysis
ii. the ;faa3il;-that-fulfils-the-role-of-the-;xabar; analysis

Such is the case in examples (@3amal_mush_aqaaimun_zaydun) [أَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
and (@3amal_mush_maa_qaaimun_zaydun) [مَا قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ]{.ar} above.
