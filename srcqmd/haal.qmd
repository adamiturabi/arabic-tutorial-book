# The ;hal;

## Introduction

The _;hal;_ 
([ٱلْحَال]{.ar})
is a kind of adverb that describes the temporal state of the _;sahib_hal;_ 
during the action of the ;hal;'s ;3aamil;.
Here is an example of a ;hal;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{رَاكِضًا} \txarb{زَيْدٌ} \txarb{جَاءَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-1.north west) -- (word-1.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-2.north west) -- (word-2.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize person of ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-3.north west) -- (word-3.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize governor};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=3ex, right=-1ex, align=left] {``Zayd came running''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

What we mean by
"temporal state of the ;sahib_hal;"
is that
Zayd, while he was coming, was in a running state.
It is a temporary state because Zayd cannot be always described as running.
His running state is tied to his coming.
By the way,
we are not not using "state" terminologically as in ;ustate;, ;astate;, etc.
Rather we are using it here to mean Zayd's condition or mode of being.

Note that, like adverbs in general, the ;hal; is in the ;astate;.
