# The ;hal;

## Introduction

The _;hal;_ 
([ٱلْحَال]{.ar})
is a kind of adverb,
governed typically by a verb,
that describes the state
of the _;sahib_hal;_ 
during the time that the ;hal;'s governing verb is taking place.
<!--
during the action of the ;hal;'s ;3aamil;.
-->
Here is an example of a ;hal;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{رَاكِبًا} \txarb{زَيْدٌ} \txarb{جَاءَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-1.north west) -- (word-1.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-2.north west) -- (word-2.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize person of ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-3.north west) -- (word-3.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize governor};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=3ex, right=-1ex, align=left] {``Zayd came riding''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the example above,
the usage of the ;hal; signifies that
Zayd, while he was coming, was in a riding state.

By the way,
we are not not using "state" here terminologically, as in ;ustate;, ;astate;, etc.  Rather we are using it to mean Zayd's condition or mode of being.
<!--
What we mean by
"temporal state of the ;sahib_hal;"
is that
It is a temporary state because Zayd is only described as angry while he is coming.
-->

<!--
Note that, like adverbs in general, the ;hal; is in the ;astate;.
Typically, the ;hal; is an ;sifah;, its ;3aamil; is a verb, and the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal;.
But, as we will see later in this chapter ;ia;, sometimes the ;hal; may have differing behavior.
-->

## Matching the ;hal; to the ;sahib_hal;

Consider again the example:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/112C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding"

The ;hal;
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
is an adjectival noun matching the ;sahib_hal; [زَيْد]{.ar} in number (singular) and gender (masculine).

If the ;sahib_hal; is feminine in gender or more than one in number, then the ;hal; will match it accordingly.
For example:

(@) [قَامَتِ ٱبْنَتُهُ إِلَيْهِ بَاكِيَةً]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 196D]{.citex}  
    "His daughter [went and] stood to him crying"

(@) [وَثَبَا مُسْرِعَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4794@]{.citex}  
    "they~2m~ got up hastening"

(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) [جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ وَخَالِدٌ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}  
    "[#saeId]{.trn2} and [#xAlid]{.trn2} came riding."

For plurals, both sound and broken plurals may be used:

(@) [وَٱدْخُلُوا ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/58@]{.citex}  
    "and enter the gate bowing humbly"  
    (The ;sahib_hal; is the plural masculine ;faa3il; pronoun in [ٱدْخُلُوا]{.ar} and the ;hal; [سُجَّد]{.ar} is the plural of [سَاجِد]{.ar}.)

(@) [خَرَجْنَا مُتَوَجِّهِينَ إِلَىٰ ٱلْيَمَنِ]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 196D]{.citex}  
    "We left heading towards Yemen"


As with ;na3t;s and ;xabar;s, when the ;sahib_hal; is a plural of
non-intelligent beings,
the singular feminine is typically used for the ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [صَالَتِ ٱلْأُسُودُ عَلَى ٱلْفَرِيسَةِ فَاتِكَةً]{.ar}  
    "The lions pounced on the prey slaying"

## The ;3aamil; of the ;hal;

The ;3aamil; of the ;hal; may be one of the following:

##### A verb {.unnumbered}

The verb is the typical ;3aamil; of the ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113D]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding"

##### A ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

(@) [رُكُوبُكَ ٱلسَّيَارَةَ مُسْرِعَةً خَطَرٌ عَلَيْكَ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/51]{.citex}  
    "Your riding the car speeding is a danger for you."

##### A ;shibh_fi3l; {.unnumbered}

A ;shibh_fi3l; is a ;mushtaqq; verbal noun like an ;ism_fail; or an ;ism_maful;, or an ;sifah;, etc.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ عَمْرًا قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113D]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is beating [#eamr]{.trn2} standing."

(@) [زَيْدٌ حَسَنٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113D]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is handsome standing."

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ قَاعِدًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/114A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd, standing, is more handsome than him sitting."

##### An expression that has verbal force  {.unnumbered}

An expression that has verbal force could be:

* a preposition or adverb of time or place with a following noun in the ;istate;
* a ;ism_isharah;
* a ;adat_istifham;
* a word like [لَيْتَ]{.ar}, [كَأَنَّ]{.ar}, [لَعَلَّ]{.ar}

In such cases there will typically be the implicit existential verb "is" providing the verbal force.

Examples:

(@) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/114A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is in the house standing."
    (the existential verb "is" is implied)

(@) [هَـٰذَا عَمْرٌو مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/114B]{.citex}  
    "This is [#eamr]{.trn2} setting out."

(@) [وَهَـٰذَا بَعْلِي شَيْخًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/11/72@ cited by @wright@ 2/114B]{.citex}  
    "and this, my husband, is an old man"

(@) [مَا شَأْنُكَ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/114B]{.citex}  
    "What is your matter, standing?"  
    (i.e. "Why are you standing?")

(@) [مَا لَكَ وَاقِفًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/114B]{.citex}  
    "What (happened) to you, standing?"  
    (i.e. "Why are you standing?")

<!--
(@) [خَالِدٌ مُسَافِرٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/52]{.citex}  
    "[#xAlid]{.trn2} is a traveller as he is riding."

(@) [زَيْدٌ مَضْرُوبٌ وَاقِفًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/52]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is beaten standing."

##### The existential verb "is" as the ;3aamil; of the ;hal; {.unnumbered}

Arabic does not usually express the existential verb "is".
However, it is implicit and may be the govern the ;hal;.
For example,

(@) [هَـٰذَا كِتَابُكَ جَمِيلًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/52]{.citex}  
    "This is your book (being) beautiful."

This is frequently the case in questions like:

(@) [مَا شَأْنُكَ وَاقِفًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/52]{.citex}  
    "What is your matter, standing?"  
    (i.e. "Why are you standing?")

(@) [مَا لَكَ مُنْطَلِقًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/52]{.citex}  
    "What (happened) to you, setting out?"  
    (i.e. "Why are you setting out?")
-->


## Valid ;sahibs_hal;

The ;sahib_hal; may be the ;faa3il; of the governing verb
but it may also be the ;mafulb;,
or even other nouns in a sentence.

Let's see some examples.

#### The ;sahib_hal; as a ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

(@) [فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/28/21@]{.citex}  
    "So he left it, fearful"

#### The ;sahib_hal; as a ;mafulb; {.unnumbered}

(@) [وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/4/79@]{.citex}  
    "And We have sent you, [O Muḥammad], to the people as a messenger"

(@) [رَكِبْتُ ٱلْفَرَسَ مُسْرَجًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I rode the horse saddled"

#### The ;sahib_hal; as a ;naib; ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

(@) [تُؤْكَلُ ٱلْفَاكِهَةُ نَاضِجَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "The fruit is eaten fresh"

#### The ;sahib_hal; as a ;mubtada; {.unnumbered}

(@) [ٱلْفَاكِهَةُ لَذِيذَةٌ نَاضِجَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "The fruit is delicious (when it is) fresh."

<!--
(The ;3aamil; in the above (and also in the below) example is not apparent but is implied. See section\ (ref) later in this chapter.)
-->

#### The ;sahib_hal; as a ;xabar; {.unnumbered}

(@) [هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلْهِلَالُ طَالِعًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "This is the crescent (as it is) rising."

#### The ;sahib_hal; in the ;istate; following a preposition {.unnumbered}

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ جَالِسًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Zayd (as he was) sitting."

(@) [كُنْتُ فِي ٱلْبُسْتَانِ زَاهِرًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113B]{.citex}  
    "I was in the garden (while it was) in bloom."

#### The ;sahib_hal; in the ;istate; in as the ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah; {.unnumbered}

The ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah; is permitted to be a ;sahib_hal; if it satisfies any one of the following conditions:

  i. When the ;mudaf; is naturally capable of being the ;3aamil; of the ;hal; (as a ;masdar; or ;ism_fail;, etc.).
     For example:

     (@) [أَعْجَبَنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ مُسْرِعًا]{.ar}
         [@wright@ 2/119C]{.citex}  
         "Zayd's standing speedily pleased me."  
         (The ;3aamil; is the ;mudaf; [قِيَام]{.ar} which is a ;masdar;)

     (@) [إِلَى ٱللَّـٰهِ مَرْجِعُكمْ جَمِيعًا]{.ar}
         [@https://quran.com/5/105@]{.citex}  
         "To Allāh is your return all together"  
         (The ;3aamil; is the ;mudaf; [مَرْجِع]{.ar} which is a ;masdar;)

     (@) [أَنْتَ شَارِبُ ٱلْمَاءِ صَافِيًا]{.ar}
         [@nahw_arabi@ 2/50]{.citex}  
         "You are drinking the water clear."
         (The ;3aamil; is the ;mudaf; [شَارِب]{.ar} which is a ;ism_fail;)

 ii. When the ;mudaf; is a real part of the ;mudafil;.
     For example:

     (@) [وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا]{.ar}
         [@https://quran.com/15/47@]{.citex}  
         "And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, [so they will be] brothers"  
         (The ;mudaf; [صُدُور]{.ar} is a real part of the ;mudafil; ;sahib_hal; [هِمْ]{.ar}.)

     (@) [أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا]{.ar}
         [@https://quran.com/49/12@]{.citex}  
         "Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead?"  
         (The ;mudaf; [لَحْم]{.ar} is a real part of the ;mudafil; ;sahib_hal; [أَخ]{.ar}.)

iii. When the ;mudaf; is not really but is virtually a part of the ;mudafil;. 
     Such that the meaning would still be correct if the ;mudaf; was removed.
     For example:

     (@) [ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ ٱتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا]{.ar}
         [@https://quran.com/16/123@]{.citex}  
         "Then We revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth"  
         ([حَنِيفًا]{.ar} is a ;hal; of the ;sahib_hal; [إِبْرَاهِيم]{.ar}. [مِلَّة]{.ar} is virtually a part of [إِبْرَاهِيم]{.ar} such that the meaning is correct without it: [ٱتَّبِعْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا]{.ar}.)

When non of these conditions are satisfied then the ;mudafil; cannot be a ;sahib_hal;.
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [مَرَرْتُ بِغُلَامِ هِنْدٍ جَالِسَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/51]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Hind's slave boy (when she was) sitting."

#### Determining the ;sahib_hal; when there is more than one possibility {.unnumbered}

When the sentence has more than one noun as a possible ;sahib_hal;, 
usually the meaning, gender, or number is sufficient to determine whom the ;hal; is describing.
But sometimes context will be needed to determine who the ;sahib_hal; is.
For example:

<!--
(@) [لَقِيتُ ٱلسُّلْطَانَ عِنْدَهُ بَاكِيًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I met the sultan in his house, crying."
-->

(@) [قَابَلْتُ ٱلْأَخَ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/386A]{.citex}  
    "I met the brother riding"

In the example above,
the ;hal;
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
may be applicable to either the speaker
(assuming he is male),
or to [ٱلْأَخ]{.ar} "the brother".
Context should tell us which is intended.
If context is not sufficient then is more suitable for the closer of the two to the ;hal; to be the ;sahib_hal;.
Or, to avoid ambiguity, it may be better that the expression not be used in this case.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/386]


<!--
## Multiple ;hal;s or ;sahibs_hal;

There can be a
one-to-one,
many-to-one,
or
one-to-many
relationship between the 
;hal; and ;sahib_hal;.
So far,
we have seen the
one-to-one
;hal; and ;sahib_hal;,
where there is one ;hal; for one ;sahib_hal;
Now we will see that there can be
multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;,
and also
one ;hal; for multiple ;sahibs_hal;.

### Multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;
-->

## Multiple ;hal;s or ;sahibs_hal;

There may be one or multiple ;hal;s that correspond to one or multiple ;sahibs_hal;.
This occurs in the following cases:

### Multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;

These are examples of 
multiple ;hal;s corresponding to one ;sahib_hal;:

(@) [وَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسى إِلى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبانَ أَسِفًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/7/150@]{.citex}  
    "And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved"

(@) [ارْجِعِي إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَرْضِيَّةً]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/89/28@]{.citex}  
    "Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]"

(@) [مَا لَكِ يَا عَائِشُ حَشْيَا رَابِيَةً]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:974b@]{.citex}  
    "Why are you, O [#eAEicah]{.trn2}, panting and short of breath?"  
    ([حَشْيَا]{.ar}, on the pattern [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar}, is the feminine of [حَشْيَان]{.ar} meaning "short of breath". [رَابِيَة]{.ar} has a similar meaning.)

As you can see, there is no need for a ;3atf; like [و]{.ar} to connect the multiple ;hal;s
(though we may use the word "and" in the translation).
If such a [و]{.ar} is inserted, then the noun(s) following it is technically no longer a ;hal;.
Rather, it is now a ;ma3toof; to the preceding ;hal;.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/386]
For example:

(@) [أَقْبَلَ ٱلْمُنْتَصِرُ فَرِحًا وَمُسْرِعًا وَمُصَافِحًا رِفَاقَهُ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/430]{.citex}  
    "The victor approached rejoicing, hastening, and shaking hands with his companions."

In the above example,
[فَرِحًا]{.ar}
is a ;hal;,
[مُسْرِعًا]{.ar}
and
[مُصَافِحًا]{.ar}
are ;ma3toof;s.

This distinction is technically correct.
However, loosely speaking, words like 
[مُسْرِعًا]{.ar}
and
[مُصَافِحًا]{.ar}
in the example above may be referred to as ;hal;s.^[See, for example, the analysis of [طَمَعًا]{.ar} in @https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/32/16@ ([يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهم خَوْفًا وطَمَعًا]{.ar})]

See also section\ (ref) later in this chapter for multiple ;hal;s when one or more is a _sentence ;hal;_.

### One ;hal; for multiple ;sahibs_hal;

If there are multiple ;sahibs_hal; and the same ;hal; can be used to describe all of them,
then one ;hal;, appropriately dualized or pluralized, may be used.
We have already seen an example of this in example
(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) earlier in this chapter:

(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) [جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ وَخَالِدٌ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}  
    "[#saeId]{.trn2} and [#xAlid]{.trn2} came riding."

Here is another example:

(@) [وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَائِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/14/33@]{.citex}  
    "And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit]"

Sometimes the multiple ;sahibs_hal; may even occur in different functions in the sentence.
For example:

(@) [قَابَلَ عَلِيٌّ صَدِيقَهُ مَسْرُورَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "[#ealiyy]{.trn2} met his friend (while they both were) happy."

(@) [لَقِيتُهُ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113B]{.citex}  
    "I met him (while we both were) riding"

### Multiple ;hal;s for multiple ;sahibs_hal;

If there are multiple ;sahibs_hal;,
and each is to be described by different ;hal;s,
then the individual ;hal;s may occur in the sentence without any conjunction.
If context and meaning are not sufficient to determine which ;hal; applies to which ;sahib_hal;,
then the first ;hal; (in sentence word order) should apply to the second ;sahib_hal;,
and the second ;hal; should apply to the first ;sahib_hal;.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/387, @nahw_arabi@ 2/38--39. But see also @wright@ 2/115CD]
For example:

(@) [لَقِيتُ خَالِدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/39]{.citex}  
    "I met [#xAlid]{.trn2} (while he was) going up (and I~m~ was) coming down."

But if meaning and context are sufficient to disambiguate, then the ;hal;s may occur in either order.
For example:

(@) [لَقِيتُ هِنْدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/39]{.citex}  
    "I met Hind (while I~m~ was) going up (and she was) coming down."

<!--
(@) [حَدَّثَ ٱلْمُحَاضِرُ طُلَّابَهُ جَالِسِينَ وَاقِفًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}
    "The lecturer "
-->

## Definiteness of the ;hal;

The ;hal; is typically an indefinite noun,
as we have seen in all the examples so far.
Occasionally, however, it does occur as a definite noun.
The most common such ;hal; is the noun [وَحْد]{.ar} annexed to a pronoun, meaning "alone".
For example:

(@) [جَاءَ ٱلضَّيْفَ وَحْدَهُ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/375]{.citex}  
    "The guest came by himself."

Other definite nouns may also occur as ;hal;s.
For example:

(@) [ٱدْخُلُوا ٱلْأَوَّلَ فَٱلْأَوَّلَ]{.ar}  
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/376]{.citex}  
    "Enter! the first then the first"  
    (i.e. "Enter in order")
     
(@) [كَلَّمْتُهُ فَاهُ إِلَىٰ فِيَّ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/34]{.citex}  
    "I spoke to him his mouth to my mouth."  
    (i.e. face to face)

The definite ;hal; may also occur in a comparative statement.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ ٱلرَّاكِبَ أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمَاشِي]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/116D]{.citex}  
    "Zayd as the rider is more handsome than he is (as) the walker."

Although, it is more usual to use the indefinite ;hal; in this case: 
[زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ مَاشِيًا]{.ar}.

## Definiteness of the ;sahib_hal;

The ;sahib_hal; is typically a definite noun,
as we have seen in all the examples so far.
Sometimes, however, it does occur as an indefinite noun.
Usually, when the ;sahib_hal; is indefinite, it occurs in the following circumstances:

##### The ;hal; precedes the indefinite  ;sahib_hal; {.unnumbered}

(@) [فِيهَا قَائِمًا رَجُلًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/117B]{.citex}  
    "in it (i.e. the house) is a man standing"

The order of the ;hal; and the ;sahib_hal; is treated in more detail in section\ (ref).

##### The indefinite ;sahib_hal; is qualified by a describer or a ;mudafil; {.unnumbered}

(@) [عِنْدِي غُلَامُ رَجُلٍ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/117D]{.citex}  
    "in my house is a man's slave standing"

(@) [قَدِمَ طِفْلٌ صَغِيرٌ بَاكِيًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/45]{.citex}  
    "a small child came crying"

(@) [وَبَارَكَ فِيهَا وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَا أَقْوَاتَهَا فِي أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَاءً لِّلسَّائِلِينَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/41/10@ cited by @nahw_arabi@ 2/45]{.citex}  
    "and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the information of] those who ask."

##### The indefinite ;sahib_hal; is in a negative statement or a question {.unnumbered}

(@) [مَا خَابَ عَامِلٌ مُخْلِصًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/403]{.citex}  
    "A worker, when sincere, does not fail."

(@) [لَا تَشْرَبْ فِي كُوبٍ مَكْسُورًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/403]{.citex}  
    "Don't drink in a cup (when it is) broken."

(@) [أَجَاءَ أَحَدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/44]{.citex}  
    "Did anyone come riding?"


##### The indefinite ;sahib_hal; without any special circumstance {.unnumbered}

Occasionally, 
the ;sahib_hal; may be indefinite without any special circumstance.^[@nahw_arabi@ 2/45--47]
For example:

(@) [وَصَلَّى وَرَاءَهُ قَوْمٌ قِيَامًا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1113@]{.citex}  
    "and [some] people prayed behind him standing"

## The order of the ;hal;, the ;sahib_hal; and the ;3aamil;

The normal order is: first the ;3aamil;, then the ;sahib_hal;, then the ;hal;.
However, there is much variability permitted, subject to certain rules.

### The ;hal; preceding the ;3aamil;

The ;hal; may precede the ;3aamil; if
the ;3aamil; is an verb
or ;shibh_fi3l;
that flexes based on the doer.

So we can say:

(@) [رَاكِبًا جَاءَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118B]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding."

(@) [مُسْرِعًا ذَا رَاحِلٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118B and @nahw_arabi@ 2/53]{.citex}  
    "In haste is this this (man) departing."  
    ([ذَا]{.ar} is a pointing noun like [هَـٰدَا]{.ar}. See section\ (ref).)

If the ;3aamil; is a verb or ;sifah; that is rigid (does not flex based on the doer),
then the ;hal; may not precede the ;3aamil;.
Examples of such ;3aamil;s are the verb of wonder and the ;af3al;.
For example:

(@) [مَا أَحْسَنَ زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118B]{.citex}  
    (not ;x; [ضَاحِكًا مَا أَحْسَنَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar})  
    "How handsome is Zayd (when) laughing!"

(@) [زَيْدٌ أَحْسَنُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو ضَاحِكًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118B]{.citex}  
    (not ;x; [زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو]{.ar})  
    "Zayd is more handsome than [#eamr]{.trn2} (when) laughing."

An exception is permitted with a noun, in one ;hal;, is compared with itself or another noun in another ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ قَاعِدًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd when standing is more handsome than [himself] when sitting."

(@) [زَيْدٌ مُفْرَدًا أَنْفَعُ مِنْ عَمْرٍو مُعَانًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd when alone is more useful than [#eamr]{.trn2} when assisted (by others)."

If the ;3aamil; is not a verb or a ;shibh_fi3l; but an expression that has verbal force,
then the ;hal; is generally not permitted to precede the ;3aamil;.^[See, however, @https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/39/67@ for the recitation [والسماوات مطوياتٍ بيمينه]{.ar}. Also mentioned by @wright@ 2/118D]

(@) [كَأَنَّ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا أَسَدٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118D]{.citex}  
    (not ;x; [رَاكِبًا كَأَنَّ زَيْدٌ أَسَدٌ]{.ar})  
    "[It is] as if Zayd, when riding, is a lion."

(@) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/118D]{.citex}  
    (not ;x; [زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar})  
    "Zayd is in the house standing."

(@) [تِلْكَ هِنْدٌ بَاحِثَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/53]{.citex}  
    (not ;x; [بَاحِثَةً تِلْكَ هِنْدٌ]{.ar})  
    "That is Hind, searching."

### The ;hal; preceding the ;sahib_hal;

The ;hal; is generally allowed to precede the ;sahib_hal; when the ;sahib_hal; is in the ;ustate; or ;astate;.
For example:

(@) [جَاءَ ضَاحِكًا زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/119A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding."

(@) [شَرِبْتُ ٱلْمَاءَ صَافِيًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/48]{.citex}  
    "I drank the water clear."

Excepted from this general permissibility is if the ;sahib_hal; is restricted by [إِلَّا]{.ar}.
For example:

(@) [مَا جَاءَ أُسَامَةُ إِلَّا رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/48]{.citex}  
    "[#usAmah]{.trn2} did not come except riding."

(@) [وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنْذِرِينَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/6/48@]{.citex}  
    "And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners."

When the ;sahib_hal; is in the ;istate; then:
if it is a ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;, then the ;hal; should follow the ;sahib_hal; and not precede it.

For example:

(@) [أَعْجَبَنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ مُسْرِعًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/119C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd's standing speedily pleased me."

If the ;sahib_hal; is in the ;istate; due to a preceding preposition, then
the ;hal; will usually follow it and not precede it.
For example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِهِنْدٍ جَالِسَةً]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/119B]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Hind (when she was) sitting."

Occasionally, however, the ;hal; has been found to precede the ;istate; ;sahib_hal; preceded by a preposition.
For example:

(@) [وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا كَافَّةً لِلنَّاسِ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/34/28@]{.citex}  
    "And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind"

### Reasons for varying the normal order

The natural order, as we have mentioned, is:
first the ;3aamil;, then the ;sahib_hal;, then the ;hal;.
So normally we would say:

(@) [حَضَرَ مُحَمَّدٌ مَاشِيًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/55]{.citex}  
    "[#muHammad]{.trn2} came walking."

The speaker may choose to vary this normal order for a variety of reasons.
For example, if 
[#muHammad]{.trn2}
had been previously hampered from walking due to an illness or injury, then
in order to emphasize his being able to walk, the speaker may say:

(@) [حَضَرَ مَاشِيًا مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/55]{.citex}

Or if the listener was incorrectly assuming that
[#muHammad]{.trn2}
came riding and not walking, then the speaker may wish to disabuse him by saying

(@) [مَاشِيًا حَضَرَ مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/55]{.citex}

There may be other reasons as well.^[@maani_nahw@ 2/354]

## Transitory and permanent meanings for the ;hal;

Fundamentally, the ;hal; is transitory in its meaning;
i.e. it is not meant to be a permanent description of the ;sahib_hal;.
For example:

(@) [جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ غَاضِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "[#saeId]{.trn2} came angry"

(@) [أَقْبَلَ خَالِدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "[#xAlid]{.trn2} came riding."

In the above examples, the ;hal;s
[غَاضِبًا]{.ar} "angry"
and
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar} "riding"
are meant to be transitory descriptions,
such that it is conceivable that
[#saeId]{.trn2} may cease to be angry,
and that
[#xAlid]{.trn2} could come walking instead of riding.

<!--
However, there are circumstances in which the ;hal; may be a more permanent description of the ;sahib_hal;.
These circumstances are:

#### The ;hal; describes ;sahib_hal; coming in to existence {.unnumbered}

When the ;hal; describes ;sahib_hal; as it comes in to existence or relevance,
then it may have a permanent meaning.
-->

However, it is possible that the ;hal; have a more permanent meaning.
This is primarily when 
the ;hal; describes ;sahib_hal; as it comes in to existence or relevance.

For example:

(@) [وَخُلِقَ ٱلْإِنْسَانُ ضَعِيفًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/4/28@]{.citex}  
    "and mankind was created weak"

(@) [قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنْثَىٰ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/3/36@]{.citex}  
    "she said, 'My Lord, I have delivered a female.'"

(@) [وَلَدَتْهُ أَزْرَقَ ٱلْعَيْنَينِ أَفْطَسَ ٱلْأَنْفِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/29]{.citex}  
    "She gave birth to him blue-eyed (and) snub-nosed"

The ;hal; may also have a more permanent meaning in the sense that
while it describes the ;sahib_hal; linked in time to the ;3aamil;,
its meaning also applies more permanently to the ;sahib_hal;.
For example:

(@) [وَهَـٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيمًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/6/126@ cited by @nahw_arabi@ 2/30]{.citex}  
    "And this is the path of your Lord, [leading] straight"  
    (The ;hal; [مُسْتَقِيمًا]{.ar} "straight" applies permanently to the ;sahib_hal; [صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ]{.ar} "path of your Lord")

## Difference in meaning between the ;hal; and the ;na3t;

The ;hal; and the the ;na3t; are typically both sourced from ;sifah;s.
And generally when you use the ;sifah; as a ;hal; it will have a different meaning from when it is used as a ;sifah;.

Consider the following two examples:

(@) [هَـٰذَا ٱلْفَرَسُ ٱلسَّابِقُ]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/334]{.citex}  
    "This is the foremost horse."

(@) [هَـٰذَا ٱلْفَرَسُ سَابِقًا]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/334]{.citex}  
    "This is the horse (when it is) foremost"

The former sentence is describing the horse as being foremost,
but not necessarily at the time when the speaker is pointing to it.
So, at the moment of pointing to it, the horse may actually be tethered.
Whereas the latter sentence is describing the horse at the moment of pointing at it. 
It would likely be running and and being foremost at that time.

Similarly, consider:

(@) [أَقْبَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْمُقَصِّرُ]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/333]{.citex}  
    "The slacking student approached."

(@) [أَقْبَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ مُقَصِّرًا]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/333]{.citex}  
    "The student approached (while) slacking."

The same distinction appiles to the above two examples.
The former sentence describes the student as a slacker generally.
But he may not be slacking at the moment when he is approaching.
Whereas the latter sentence describes the student as slacking when he is approaching.
He may not be a slacker in general.

<!--
Even when the ;sifah; used for the ;hal; has a more permanent meaning,
there can be a distinction from it being used as a ;na3t;.
-->

However, there can sometimes be some overlap in meaning.^[See also [شرح إبي سعيد بهامش كتاب سيبويه]{.ar} 1/272 cited by @maani_nahw@ 2/350]
For example, in the scenario when all the following conditions are satisfied:

* the ;hal; has a transitory meaning,
* the meaning of the ;hal; is a description of motion or posture (like "sitting", "standing", "sleeping", "running", etc.),
* the ;sahib_hal; is indefinite,
* the ;3aamil; is an expression that has verbal force (see section\ (ref)).

In such a case, the ;sifah; used as a ;na3t; may have a somewhat similar meaning to it being used a ;hal;.
For example:
<!--
(@) [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلٌ نَائمٌ]{.ar}  
    "In the house, is a sleeping man."  
    (;na3t;)

(@) [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلٌ نَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    "In the house, is a man sleeping."  
    (;hal;)
-->

(@) [فِيهَا رَجُلٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    "In it (i.e. the house), is a standing man."  
    (;na3t;)

(@) [فِيهَا رَجُلٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [[سيبويه]{.ar} 1/272 cited by @maani_nahw@ 2/352]{.citex}  
    "In the house, is a man standing."  
    (;hal;)

There may also be a case where the ;hal; is indistinguishable from the ;na3t; due to the ;sahib_hal; being indefinite and in the ;astate;.
For example:

(@) [رَأَيْتُ طَالِبًا مُقَصِّرًا]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/352]{.citex}  
    "I saw a student slacking."  
    or  
    "I saw a slacking student."  

## An ;jamid; noun as the ;hal;

Because the ;hal; is a description of the ;sahib_hal;,
and a description is likely to be a ;sifah;,
and ;sifah;s are typically ;mushtaqq; nouns,
it therefore follows that the ;hal; is likely to be a ;mushtaqq; noun.
Most of the examples we have seen so far have been of the ;hal; as a
;mushtaqq; noun.
For example:
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar},
[غَاضِبًا]{.ar}, etc.
However, it is possible for the
;hal; to be ;jamid; noun.
Here are some examples:

(@) [طَلَعَ ٱلْقَمَرُ بَدْرًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/115A]{.citex}  
    "The moon rose (as) a full moon."

    [@wright@ 2/115A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd charged (like) a lion."

    [@wright@ 2/115A]{.citex}  
    "I sold the sheep (at the rate of) a sheep [for] a dirham."

    (i.e. for ready money)

(@) [بَيَّنْتُ لَهُ حِسَابَهُ بَابًا بَابًا]{.ar}

    (i.e. face to face)

    [@wright@ 2/115B]{.citex}

    "And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’ān"

(@) [هَـٰذِهِ فِضَّتُكَ خَاتَمًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/34]{.citex}  
    "This is your silver, as a ring."

(@) [هَـٰذَا خَاتَمُكَ فِضَّةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/34]{.citex}  
    "This is your ring, in silver"

## A ;masdar; as the ;hal;

<!--
While the ;hal; is usually a ;sifah; it does frequently occur as an indefinite ;masdar;.
-->
The ;masdar; can sometimes _appear_ to be a ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [أَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ رَكْضًا]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 2/345]{.citex}  
    "[#ealiyy]{.trn2} approached (in the state of) running."

In the above example, the opinion of some scholars would be that
the ;masdar;
[رَكْضًا]{.ar}
is a ;hal;.
And this is a substitute for saying 
[أَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ رَاكِضًا]{.ar}.

When the ;masdar; is used thus it remains in the indefinite singular regardless of the number of the ;sahibs_hal;.
For example:

(@) [أَقْبَلَ ٱلْقَوْمُ رَكْضًا]{.ar}  
    "The people approached running."

The reasons for using a ;masdar;
[رَكْضًا]{.ar}
in this way instead of the ;sifah;
[رَاكِضًا]{.ar}
may be:

 i. Emphasis. The ;masdar; signifies purely the meaning of the verb "to run".
    Whereas the ;sifah; signifies the meaning of the verb along with person described by the ;sifah; (the runner).
    So using the ;masdar; as a ;hal; draws attention to the meaning of running rather than the person who is running.
    The ;masdar; used in this way can also be seen as a sort of metaphor,
    as if [#ealiyy]{.trn2}, while executing the action of running, _became_ the act of running.^[@maani_nahw@ 2/348]

ii. Expanding the sense of the adverb to incorporate other adverbs.
    The ;masdar; 
    [رَكْضًا]{.ar},
    in the above example, can also be analyzed as an ;mmutlaq; (being a ;naib; to the ;masdar; [إِقْبَال]{.ar}) meaning:

    (@) [أَقْبَلَ عَلِيٌّ إِقْبَالَ رَكْضٍ]{.ar}
        [@maani_nahw@ 2/348]{.citex}  
       "[#ealiyy]{.trn2} approached (in) the type of approaching (that is) running."

    The use of the ;masdar; in this way could then be used to intend both the ;hal; meaning and the ;mmutlaq; meaning together.
    That is [#ealiyy]{.trn2}'s type and state of approaching was running.

    Depending on the meaning of the ;masdar;, other types of adverbs, like the ;mafull;, may be included in this expanded sense as well.^[@maani_nahw@ 2/348]

Some scholars are conservative in analyzing a ;masdar; as a ;hal;, and instead prefer that it be analyzed as another adverb, like a (;naib;) ;mmutlaq; or an ;mafull;, etc.^[See @faysal_mansoor_articles@ 529--530]
And if the meaning of the ;masdar; does not allow it to be analyzed as another adverb, and only as a ;hal; then it is accepted as a permitted usage but one that is restricted to what has been recorded from Classical Arabic.

Here are some examples of ;masdar;s having being analyzed as ;hal;.
They may fit other adverbs instead or as well.

## A sentence as the ;hal;

In the examples so far,
the ;hal; has always been a single word,
usually an ;sifah;.
For example,
[جَاءَ زَيْدٌ ضَاحِكًا]{.ar} "Zayd came laughing".
Instead, of using the ;sifah;
[ضَاحِكًا]{.ar},
we can instead use the ;ustate; ;mudarie; verb
[يَضْحَكُ]{.ar}:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ يَضْحَكُ]{.ar}
    [@wright@, 2/331C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came laughing."

Actually,
[يَضْحَكُ]{.ar}
is not just a verb.
Rather, it is a complete sentence
comprising of the verb itself and the ;faa3il;
which, in this case, is the hidden pronoun "he".
So the ;hal; here is a sentence.

As we know, the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal; during time of ;hal;'s governing verb.
The use of the ;mudarie; verb
[يَضْحَكُ]{.ar}
signifies that Zayd's action of laughing was ongoing during the time of the ;3aamil; [جَاءَ]{.ar}.
So [يَضْحَكُ]{.ar} has a past meaning because of the ;madi; verb [جَاءَ]{.ar}.
An additional verb like [كَانَ]{.ar} is not needed to transport the verb
[يَضْحَكُ]{.ar} to the past.
Similarly, if the ;3aamil; was in the present or the future, the ;mudarie; verb in the ;hal; would automatically be transported to the present or future as well.
For example:

(@) [سَيَأْتِي زَيْدٌ يَضْحَكُ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd will come laughing."

In fact, it is not permitted for the ;hal; sentence that begins with the ;mudarie; verb to itself be prefixed with [سَ]{.ar} or [سَوْفَ]{.ar}.^[@maani_nahw@ 2/354 citing @radiy_kafiyah@]
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [سَيَأْتِي زَيْدٌ سَيَضْحَكُ]{.ar} or  
    ;x; [يَأْتِي زَيْدٌ سَيَضْحَكُ]{.ar}

This restriction only applies to ;mudarie; verbs that begin a sentence ;hal;.
If a ;mudarie; verb begins a sentence that is not a ;hal; then it may begin with [سَ]{.ar} or [سَوْفَ]{.ar}.
For example:

(@) [وَقَالَ إِنِّى ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/37/99@]{.citex}  
    "And [then] he said, 'Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me."

Here are some more examples of sentence ;hal;s comprised of a ;mudarie; verb and a ;faa3il; (or ;naib; ;faa3il;) pronoun:

(@) [وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/12/16@]{.citex}  
    "And they came to their father at night, weeping."

### The link between the sentence ;hal; and the ;sahib_hal;

The sentence comprising of only the ;mudarie; verb and its doer is the simplest, and one of the most common, kind of ;hal; sentence.
However, more complex ;hal; sentences are also possible.
And the ;sahib_hal; need not always be the ;faa3il; of the verb in the sentence.

But the sentence ;hal; needs to have a link between it and the ;sahib_hal;.
This link is often a pronoun that refers back to the ;sahib_hal;.
In the examples above this link pronoun was the ;faa3il; pronoun of the ;mudarie; verb.
Here are some more examples of ;hal; sentences where the ;hal; sentence is a more complex kind of sentence:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@, 2/331A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came (with) his hand on his head."  

In the example above,
the sentence [يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ]{.ar} is the ;hal;. 
Note that [يَد]{.ar} is in the ;ustate; because it is the ;mubtada; of the sentence.
It is not in the ;astate; because it is not, by itself, the ;hal;.
The entire sentence
[يَدُهُ عَلَىٰ رَأْسِهِ]{.ar} is considered to be in the ;astate; as the ;hal;.
The link is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in [يَدُهُ]{.ar} and [رَأْسِهِ]{.ar}.

(@) [ٱهْبِطُوا۟ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٍّ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/36@]{.citex}  
    "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another"  
    (The sentence [بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٍّ]{.ar} is the ;hal;. The link is the pronoun [كُمْ]{.ar} in [بَعْضُكُمْ]{.ar}.)

### The [و]{.ar} of ;hal;

Instead of, or in addition to, a pronoun as the link between the sentence ;hal; and the ;sahib_hal;,
a special [و]{.ar}, called the
[و]{.ar}\ _of ;hal;_,
may be used.
The [و]{.ar} of ;hal;
signifies that the sentence ;hal; occurred _while_ the governing verb took place.
Here are some examples of the
the [و]{.ar} of ;hal;:

(@) [قَامَ زَيْدٌ وَهَوَ بَاكٍ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/330C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd stood up while he was crying."

(@) [أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم  مَرَّ بِسَعْدٍ وَهُوَ يَتَوَضَّأُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:425@]{.citex}  
    "that the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} ;pbuh; passed by [#saed]{.trn2} while he was performing ablution"

We have defined the ;hal; as an adverb that describes the ;sahib_hal;.
However,
sometimes, the ;hal; sentence that is linked with a
[و]{.ar} of ;hal;
won't apparently describe the ;sahib_hal;.
In fact, it may not even refer to the ;sahib_hal; at all.
For example:

(@) [ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو يَشْتَغِلُ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/331A]{.citex}  
    "Zayd went while [#eamr]{.trn2} was busy."

In the examples above,
the ;hal;'s
description of the ;sahib_hal; is only circumstantial,
in that it alludes to the time in which the action of the governing verb occurred.
In such cases
the meaning of the ;hal; approaches that of the adverb of time.
This is another of the cases where the lines between different types of adverbs get blurred.
We have seen similar cases in sections\ (ref).



Depending on the use case,
the [و]{.ar} of ;hal;
may be mandatory, optional, or forbidden.
And we will go over these cases in the next section.
But here we will discuss the difference in meaning between when the
