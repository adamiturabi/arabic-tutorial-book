# The ;hal;

## Introduction

The _;hal;_ is a kind of adverb that describes the temporal state of the _;sahib_hal;_.
What we mean by
"temporal state of the ;sahib_hal;"
is how the ;sahib_hal; appeared.
(We are not not using "state" terminologically as in ;ustate;, ;astate;, etc.
Rather we are using it here to mean the condition or mode of being.)

Here is an example of a ;hal;:

Note that, like adverbs in general, the ;hal; is in the ;astate;.
