# The ;hal;

## Introduction

The _;hal;_ 
([ٱلْحَال]{.ar})
is a kind of adverb,
governed typically by a verb,
that describes the state
of the _;sahib_hal;_ 
during the time that the ;hal;'s governing verb is taking place.
<!--
during the action of the ;hal;'s ;3aamil;.
-->
Here is an example of a ;hal;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{رَاكِبًا} \txarb{زَيْدٌ} \txarb{جَاءَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-1.north west) -- (word-1.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-2.north west) -- (word-2.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize person of ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-3.north west) -- (word-3.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize governor};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=3ex, right=-1ex, align=left] {``Zayd came riding''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the example above,
the usage of the ;hal; signifies that
Zayd, while he was coming, was in a riding state.

By the way,
we are not not using "state" here terminologically, as in ;ustate;, ;astate;, etc.  Rather we are using it to mean Zayd's condition or mode of being.
<!--
What we mean by
"temporal state of the ;sahib_hal;"
is that
It is a temporary state because Zayd is only described as angry while he is coming.
-->

<!--
Note that, like adverbs in general, the ;hal; is in the ;astate;.
Typically, the ;hal; is an ;sifah;, its ;3aamil; is a verb, and the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal;.
But, as we will see later in this chapter ;ia;, sometimes the ;hal; may have differing behavior.
-->

## Matching the ;hal; to the ;sahib_hal;

Consider again the example:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/112C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding"

The ;hal;
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
is an adjectival noun matching the ;sahib_hal; [زَيْد]{.ar} in number (singular) and gender (masculine).

If the ;sahib_hal; is feminine in gender or more than one in number, then the ;hal; will match it accordingly.
For example:

(@) [وَٱدْخُلُوا ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/58@]{.citex}  
    "and enter the gate bowing humbly"  
    (The ;sahib_hal; is the plural masculine ;faa3il; pronoun in [ٱدْخُلُوا]{.ar} and the ;hal; [سُجَّد]{.ar} is the plural of [سَاجِد]{.ar}.)

(@) [قَامَتِ ٱبْنَتُهُ إِلَيْهِ بَاكِيَةً]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 196D]{.citex}
    "His daughter [went and] stood to him crying"

As with ;na3t;s and ;xabar;s, when the ;sahib_hal; is a plural of
non-intelligent beings,
the singular feminine is typically used for the ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [صَالَتِ ٱلْأُسُودُ عَلَى ٱلْفَرِيسَةِ فَاتِكَةً]{.ar}  
    "The lions pounced on the prey slaying"

## Valid candidates for the ;sahib_hal;

The ;sahib_hal; may be the ;faa3il; of the governing verb
(as in the examples above),
but it may also be the ;mafulb;,
or even other nouns in a sentence.

Let's see some examples.

As a ;mafulb;

Often context will be needed to determine who the ;sahib_hal; is.

## Multiple ;hal;s or ;sahibs_hal;

<!--
One ;hal; (appropriately dualized or pluralized) may even suffice for multiple individually mentioned ;sahibs_hal;.
For example:

We will discuss ;hal;s of this type separat

* ;hal; is typically an ;sifah;
* Governor of the ;hal;
* ;sahib_hal; can be ;faa3il; or ;mafulb; of governing verb. Can also be noun in oher functions

Typically, the ;hal; is an ;sifah;, its ;3aamil; is a verb, and the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal;.
But occasionally, each of these statements may be relaxed.
