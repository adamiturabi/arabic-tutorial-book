# The ;hal;

## Introduction

The _;hal;_ 
([ٱلْحَال]{.ar})
is a kind of adverb,
governed typically by a verb,
that describes the state
of the _;sahib_hal;_ 
during the time that the ;hal;'s governing verb is taking place.
<!--
during the action of the ;hal;'s ;3aamil;.
-->
Here is an example of a ;hal;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{رَاكِبًا} \txarb{زَيْدٌ} \txarb{جَاءَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-1.north west) -- (word-1.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-2.north west) -- (word-2.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize person of ḥāl};

\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate] 
   (word-3.north west) -- (word-3.north east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, right=0ex] {\scriptsize governor};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=3ex, right=-1ex, align=left] {``Zayd came riding''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the example above,
the usage of the ;hal; signifies that
Zayd, while he was coming, was in a riding state.

By the way,
we are not not using "state" here terminologically, as in ;ustate;, ;astate;, etc.  Rather we are using it to mean Zayd's condition or mode of being.
<!--
What we mean by
"temporal state of the ;sahib_hal;"
is that
It is a temporary state because Zayd is only described as angry while he is coming.
-->

<!--
Note that, like adverbs in general, the ;hal; is in the ;astate;.
Typically, the ;hal; is an ;sifah;, its ;3aamil; is a verb, and the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal;.
But, as we will see later in this chapter ;ia;, sometimes the ;hal; may have differing behavior.
-->

## Matching the ;hal; to the ;sahib_hal;

Consider again the example:

(@) [جَاءَ زَيْدٌ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/112C]{.citex}  
    "Zayd came riding"

The ;hal;
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
is an adjectival noun matching the ;sahib_hal; [زَيْد]{.ar} in number (singular) and gender (masculine).

If the ;sahib_hal; is feminine in gender or more than one in number, then the ;hal; will match it accordingly.
For example:

(@) [قَامَتِ ٱبْنَتُهُ إِلَيْهِ بَاكِيَةً]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 196D]{.citex}  
    "His daughter [went and] stood to him crying"

(@) [وَثَبَا مُسْرِعَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4794@]{.citex}  
    "they~2m~ got up quickly"

(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) [جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ وَخَالِدٌ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}  
    "[#saeId]{.trn2} and [#xAlid]{.trn2} came riding."

For plurals, both sound and broken plurals may be used:

(@) [وَٱدْخُلُوا ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّدًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/58@]{.citex}  
    "and enter the gate bowing humbly"  
    (The ;sahib_hal; is the plural masculine ;faa3il; pronoun in [ٱدْخُلُوا]{.ar} and the ;hal; [سُجَّد]{.ar} is the plural of [سَاجِد]{.ar}.)

(@) [خَرَجْنَا مُتَوَجِّهِينَ إِلَىٰ ٱلْيَمَنِ]{.ar}
    [@fischer@ 196D]{.citex}  
    "We left heading towards Yemen"


As with ;na3t;s and ;xabar;s, when the ;sahib_hal; is a plural of
non-intelligent beings,
the singular feminine is typically used for the ;hal;.
For example:

(@) [صَالَتِ ٱلْأُسُودُ عَلَى ٱلْفَرِيسَةِ فَاتِكَةً]{.ar}  
    "The lions pounced on the prey slaying"

## Valid candidates for the ;sahib_hal;

The ;sahib_hal; may be the ;faa3il; of the governing verb
(as in the examples above),
but it may also be the ;mafulb;,
or even other nouns in a sentence.

Let's see some examples.

The ;sahib_hal; as a ;faa3il;:

(@) [فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/28/21@]{.citex}  
    "So he left it, fearful"

The ;sahib_hal; as a ;mafulb;:

(@) [وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/4/79@]{.citex}  
    "And We have sent you, [O Muḥammad], to the people as a messenger"

(@) [رَكِبْتُ ٱلْفَرَسَ مُسْرَجًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I rode the horse saddled"

The ;sahib_hal; as a ;naib; ;faa3il;:

(@) [تُؤْكَلُ ٱلْفَاكِهَةُ نَاضِجَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "The fruit is eaten fresh"

The ;sahib_hal; as a ;mubtada;:

(@) [ٱلْفَاكِهَةُ لَذِيذَةٌ نَاضِجَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "The fruit is delicious (when it is) fresh."

(The governor in the above (and also in the below) example is not apparent but is implied. See section\ (ref) later in this chapter.)

The ;sahib_hal; as a ;xabar;:

(@) [هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلْهِلَالُ طَالِعًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "This is the crescent (as it is) rising."

The ;sahib_hal; in the ;istate;:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ جَالِسًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Zayd (as he was) sitting."

(@) [كُنْتُ فِي ٱلْبُسْتَانِ زَاهِرًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113B]{.citex}  
    "I was in the garden (while it was) in bloom."

When the sentence has more than one noun as a possible ;sahib_hal;, 
usually the meaning, gender, or number is sufficient to determine whom the ;hal; is describing.
But sometimes context will be needed to determine who the ;sahib_hal; is.
For example:

<!--
(@) [لَقِيتُ ٱلسُّلْطَانَ عِنْدَهُ بَاكِيًا]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113A]{.citex}  
    "I met the sultan in his house, crying."
-->

(@) [قَابَلْتُ ٱلْأَخَ رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/386A]{.citex}  
    "I met the brother riding"

In the example above,
the ;hal;
[رَاكِبًا]{.ar}
may be applicable to either the speaker
(assuming he is male),
or to [ٱلْأَخ]{.ar} "the brother".
Context should tell us which is intended.
If context is not sufficient then is more suitable for the closer of the two to the ;hal; to be the ;sahib_hal;.
Or, to avoid ambiguity, it may be better that the expression not be used at all in this case.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/386]

<!--
## Multiple ;hal;s or ;sahibs_hal;

There can be a
one-to-one,
many-to-one,
or
one-to-many
relationship between the 
;hal; and ;sahib_hal;.
So far,
we have seen the
one-to-one
;hal; and ;sahib_hal;,
where there is one ;hal; for one ;sahib_hal;
Now we will see that there can be
multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;,
and also
one ;hal; for multiple ;sahibs_hal;.

### Multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;
-->

## Multiple ;hal;s or ;sahibs_hal;

There may be one or multiple ;hal;s that correspond to one or multiple ;sahibs_hal;.
This occurs in the following cases:

### Multiple ;hal;s for one ;sahib_hal;

These are examples of 
multiple ;hal;s corresponding to one ;sahib_hal;:

(@) [وَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسى إِلى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبانَ أَسِفًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/7/150@]{.citex}  
    "And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved"

(@) [ارْجِعِي إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَرْضِيَّةً]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/89/28@]{.citex}  
    "Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]"

(@) [مَا لَكِ يَا عَائِشُ حَشْيَا رَابِيَةً]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:974b@]{.citex}  
    "Why are you, O [#eAEicah]{.trn2}, panting and short of breath?"  
    ([حَشْيَا]{.ar}, on the pattern [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar}, is the feminine of [حَشْيَان]{.ar} meaning "short of breath". [رَابِيَة]{.ar} has a similar meaning.)

As you can see, there is no need for a ;3atf; like [و]{.ar} to connect the multiple ;hal;s
(though we may use the word "and" in the translation).
If such a [و]{.ar} is inserted, then the noun(s) following it is technically no longer a ;hal;.
Rather, it is now a ;ma3toof; to the preceding ;hal;.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/386]
For example:

(@) [أَقْبَلَ ٱلْمُنْتَصِرُ فَرِحًا وَمُسْرِعًا وَمُصَافِحًا رِفَاقَهُ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/430]{.citex}  
    "The victor approached rejoicing, hastening, and shaking hands with his companions."

In the above example,
[فَرِحًا]{.ar}
is a ;hal;,
[مُسْرِعًا]{.ar}
and
[مُصَافِحًا]{.ar}
are ;ma3toof;s.

### One ;hal; for multiple ;sahibs_hal;

If there are multiple ;sahibs_hal; and the same ;hal; can be used to describe all of them,
then one ;hal;, appropriately dualized or pluralized, may be used.
We have already seen an example of this in example
(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) earlier in this chapter:

(@haal_two_sahibs_hal_dual_hal) [جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ وَخَالِدٌ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}  
    "[#saeId]{.trn2} and [#xAlid]{.trn2} came riding."

Here is another example:

(@) [وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَائِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/14/33@]{.citex}  
    "And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit]"

Sometimes the multiple ;sahibs_hal; may even occur in different functions in the sentence.
For example:

(@) [قَابَلَ عَلِيٌّ صَدِيقَهُ مَسْرُورَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/28]{.citex}  
    "[#ealiyy]{.trn2} met his friend (while they both were) happy."

(@) [لَقِيتُهُ رَاكِبَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/113B]{.citex}  
    "I met him (while we both were) riding"

### Multiple ;hal;s for multiple ;sahibs_hal;

If there are multiple ;sahibs_hal;,
and each is to be described by different ;hal;s,
then the individual ;hal;s may occur in the sentence without any conjunction.
If context and meaning are not sufficient to determine which ;hal; applies to which ;sahib_hal;,
then the first ;hal; (in sentence word order) should apply to the second ;sahib_hal;,
and the second ;hal; should apply to the first ;sahib_hal;.
For example:

(@) [لَقِيتُ خَالِدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/39]{.citex}  
    "I met [#xAlid]{.trn2} (while he was) going up (and I~m~ was) coming down."

But if meaning and context are sufficient to disambiguate, then the ;hal;s may occur in either order.
For example:

(@) [لَقِيتُ هِنْدًا مُصْعِدًا مُنْحَدِرَةً]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/39]{.citex}  
    "I met Hind (while I~m~ was) going up (and she was) coming down."

<!--
(@) [حَدَّثَ ٱلْمُحَاضِرُ طُلَّابَهُ جَالِسِينَ وَاقِفًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 2/38]{.citex}
    "The lecturer "
-->


## Transitory nature of the ;hal;

## The types of words used for the ;hal;

<!--
One ;hal; (appropriately dualized or pluralized) may even suffice for multiple individually mentioned ;sahibs_hal;.
For example:

We will discuss ;hal;s of this type separat

* ;hal; is typically an ;sifah;
* Governor of the ;hal;
* ;sahib_hal; can be ;faa3il; or ;mafulb; of governing verb. Can also be noun in oher functions

Typically, the ;hal; is an ;sifah;, its ;3aamil; is a verb, and the ;hal; describes the ;sahib_hal;.
But occasionally, each of these statements may be relaxed.
That is,
