# Sentence and government theory

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will study the Arabic grammatical model for constructing sentences.
We will first define some linguistic terms.

### Truth-evaluability

Statements are classified into two types:

 i. a ;xabari; statement
ii. a ;inshai; statement

A _;xabari;_ statement is one that can be judged to be true or false.
In other words it is falsifiable.
For example, if we have a statement:

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The above statement may be judged to have a truth value.
If zayd is actually standing, then the statement is true.
And if zayd is not standing, then the statement is false.

A _;inshai;_ statement,
on the other hand,
does not have a truth value.
Here are some examples of ;inshai; statements:

(@) [اضْرِبْ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    [Beat Zayd!]{.trans}

(@) [لَا تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}  
    [Don't do [it]!]{.trans}

(@) [يَا زَيْدُ]{.ar}  
    [O Zayd]{.trans}

(@) [مَنْ هُوَ]{.ar}  
    [Who is he?]{.trans}


### Syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics

#### Syntax and semantics {.unnumbered}

_Semantics_ is the study of the meanings of words.
And _syntax_ is the study of how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships between the words in a sentence.
For example, consider the ;sifah; [كَبِير]{.ar}.
Semantically, it gives the meaning of something being big.
When it is in a linguistic environment, like a phrase or a sentence,
then its syntactical role is determined by the grammatical relationships it has with other words in the sentence.

Consider the following sentence:

(@) [الْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
    [The house is big]{.trans}

In the above sentence, 
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is _syntactically_ a ;xabar;.

Now consider the following sentence:

(@) [دَخَلَ بَيْتًا كَبِيرًا]{.ar}  
    [He entered a big house.]{.trans}

Now the same noun
[كَبِير]{.ar}
is syntactically a ;na3t;.
In both examples,
[كَبِير]{.ar} has the same semantic signification.

<!--
#### Semantics {.unnumbered}

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words.
Consider the following sentence:

(@) taHaddatha fi al-bayt.

Here the semantic meaning of fi determines the meaning of the sentence.
If fi means "in" then the sentence means "He talked in the house."
And if fi means "regarding", then the sentence means "He talked about the house."

Semantics can affect the syntax of a sentence.

(@) al-af3Alu Hasanatun  
    "The acts are good."

(@) al-af3Alu HasanAtun  
    "The acts are good deeds."
-->

#### Pragmatics {.unnumbered}

<!--
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in context, and with regard to needs of the speaker and the listener.
-->
Pragmatics is the study of what sentences mean in a specific context or situation.


<!--
#### Functional aspects {.unnumbered}

Semantics and pragmatics
-->

#### Stylistics {.unnumbered}

In order to express a meaning, there will often be a normal way to choose words or construct a sentence's structure.
If, for some effect (rhetorical, persuasive, literary, etc.), the speaker chooses to deviate from this norm,
then he is doing so for stylistic reasons.^[Hickey, L, "Stylistics, Pragmatics, and Pragmastylistics"]


## The theory of government

A sentence in Arabic is constituted from elements.
An element can be a noun, a verb, or a particle.
Of these elements, some have the quality of state.
These are called _stateful_ elements.
The stateful elements are nouns and ;mudarie; verbs.
A noun may be either in the ;ustate;, ;astate;, or ;istate;.
And a ;mudarie; verb may be either in the ;ustate;, ;astate;, or ;0state;.
The theory of government states that a stateful element is put in a particular state by a _governor_.
For example:

(@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    [in the house]{.trans}

In the above example,
<!--
the particle fii is the governor of the noun al-daari.
The noun al-daar is the governee of its governor fii.
-->
the gpreposition [فِي]{.ar} causes the noun [الدَّار]{.ar} to be in the ;istate;.
So we say that 
the governor [فِي]{.ar} _governs_ [الدَّار]{.ar} (the _governee_) in the ;istate;.
<!--
We say that
the preposition fii is the governor of ;istate; noun al-daar because it is the reason or cause of the noun al-daar being in the ;istate;.

Here is another example:

(@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr) Daraba zaydun eamran.

In this example, the governor is the verb Daraba.
It has two governees:
the ;faa3il; zayd,
and the ;mafulb; eamr.
The governor Daraba governs the ;faa3il; zayd in the ;ustate;
and it governs the ;mafulb; in the ;astate;.

#### A governee can only have one governor  {.unnumbered}

From example (@3amal_zayd_beat_3amr),
you can see that one goveror may govern multiple governees.
However, one governee cannot be be governed by multiple governors.
In other words, there can be only one governor that causes a stateful element to be in a particular state.

#### The word-order of a governor and its governee(s)  {.unnumbered}

From the above examples,
you can see that a governor typically occurs before its governees in word-order.
For some governor-governee relationships, this word-order is obligatory,
like in example (@3amal_in_house).
For other governor-governee relationships, this word-order is more flexible.
For example, the ;maful; may occur before its governing verb, thus:

(@3amal_3amran_Daraba_zaydun) eamran Daraba zaydun

<!--
But the ;faa3il; must always follow its governing verb.
So that is another example of an obligatory word-order for the governor and the governee.
-->

## Some common governees

Let's look at some common governor-governee relationships.
We will make use of the following example:

(@) [قَرَأَ الْغُلَامُ الطَّوِيلُ كِتَابَ الجَارِيَةِ فِي الدَّارِ الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}

#### The ;istate; noun {.unnumbered}

A noun in the ;istate; is governed by a preceding preposition or ;mudaf;.
We have already seen that the
;istate; noun [الدَّار]{.ar} is governed by the preceding preposition [فِي]{.ar}.
<!--
We saw an example of a governing preposition in (@3amal_in_house) [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar} above.
-->
We also see that the ;istate; ;mudafil; [الجَارِيَةِ]{.ar}
is governed by the ;mudaf; [كِتَابَ]{.ar}.

#### The ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

The ;faa3il; of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its ;faa3il; [الْغُلَامُ]{.ar} in the ;ustate;.

#### The ;mafulb; {.unnumbered}

The ;mafulb; is also governed by its verb.
In our example the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} governs its ;mafulb; [كِتَابَ]{.ar} in the ;astate;.

#### The ;na3t; {.unnumbered}

A ;na3t; is governed by governor of its ;manut;.
In our example, the ;na3t; [الطَّوِيلُ]{.ar} is governed in the ;ustate; by [قَرَأَ]{.ar}, which is the governor of its ;manut;
[الْغُلَامُ]{.ar}.
Similarly, the ;na3t;
[الْكَبِيرَةِ]{.ar}
is governed in the ;istate; by the preposition [فِي]{.ar} because [فِي]{.ar} also governs its ;manut; [الدَّارِ]{.ar}.

<!--
Here is an example of an ;istate; noun 
([زَيْدٍ]{.ar})
being governed by a preceding ;mudaf;
([كِتَابُ]{.ar}):

(@) [كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd's book]{.trans}

#### The ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

The ;faa3il; of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its ;faa3il;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the ;ustate;.

#### The ;mafulb; {.unnumbered}

The ;faa3il; of a verb is governed by its preceding verb.
For example:

(@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}.]{.trans}  

In example (@Daraba_zaydun_3amran) above,
the verb [ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
governs its ;faa3il;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the ;ustate;.
-->

#### Ungoverned elements {.unnumbered}

Not every element in a sentence is governed by a governor.
For example, the ;madi; verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar} has no state, and thus, no governor.

Here is a diagram depicting the above governor-governee relationships:

DIAGRAM

## The two ;3umdah; elements of a sentence

In the Arabic grammatical model,
a sentence is analagous to the structure of a simple _lean-to_ building.
<!--
A building is built upon a foundation.
The foundation of the Arabic sentence
-->
This structure
requires two _;3umdah;_ elements
in order to be complete.
These two ;3umdah; elements are:

 i. The ;muxbar3;
ii. The ;muxbar;

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.25ex}]

\draw[pattern=north west lines, pattern, draw=none] (0,0) rectangle (6,-0.4);
\draw (0,0) -- (6,0);
\draw[fill=lightgray] (2,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=90] {supporting element} (2.4, 5);
\draw[fill=lightgray, rotate around={30:(5.05,-0.3)}] (5.05,-0.3) rectangle node [rotate=-60] {leaning element} (5.45, 6);

\end{tikzpicture}
```


The ;muxbar3; is the primary ;3umdah; element.
It represents whom the sentence is about, i.e. its topic.
The ;muxbar; rests against the ;muxbar3;.
<!--
And the ;muxbar; is meant to provide some interesting comment about the ;muxbar3;.
-->
It expresses some property about the ;muxbar3; that completes the meaning of the sentence.

Once the two ;3umdah; elements are in place,
the sentence is grammatically complete.
Other _;fadlah;_ elements
(see section\ (ref) below)
may be added in addition to the ;3umdah; elements to add meaning to the sentence,
but they are not required to make the sentence grammatically complete.

Let's look at the ;3umdah; elements for the two types of Arabic sentences:

<!--
Here are some examples of sentences with only ;3umdah; elements:
-->

### The ;3umdah; elements of a ;j_ism;

Consider the following ;j_ism;:

(@3amal_zayd_qaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_zayd_qaimun) above is a ;j_ism;.
The ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the ;muxbar3;. It is the topic of the sentence.
The ;xabar;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is the ;muxbar;.
It is a comment on the topic, giving us some information about
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a ;j_ism;.
In this ;j_ism; the ;mubtada; is the ;muxbar3;,
and the ;xabar; is the ;muxbar;.
-->

### The ;3umdah; elements of a ;j_f3l;

Consider the following ;j_f3l;:

(@3amal_qaama_zaydun) [قَامَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}

DIAGRAM

Example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above is a ;j_f3l;.
The ;faa3il;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the ;muxbar3;. It is the topic of the sentence.
And the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} is the ;muxbar;. It is a comment on the topic.

<!--
We have previously referred to this type of sentence as a ;j_f3l;.
In this ;j_f3l; the verb is the ;muxbar;,
and the ;faa3il; is the ;muxbar3;.
-->
<!--
We will see later, ;ia; that 
in a ;j_f3l;
the ;muxbar; may sometimes be another element, instead of the verb that governs the ;faa3il;.
-->

## Initial government

<!--
Besides the two ;3umdah; elements,
a sentence also needs an initial government.[Owens §2.3.6.1 54]
-->
In order to build a sentence from the ;3umdah; elements,
a sentence needs _initial government_.[Owens §2.3.6.1, 54]
<!--
The initial governor governs the highest governing element(s) of the two ;3umdah; elements of the sentence.
-->
<!--
The initial governor is the source of all government in the sentence.
-->
Initial government is any and all government prior to, and until, the first governed ;3umdah; element.

#### One of the two ;3umdah; elements is the initial governor {.unnumbered}

In some sentences, the intitial governor may be one of the two ;3umdah; elements.
In example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above,
the verb [قَامَ]{.ar} governs its ;faa3il; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
The ;madi; verb [قَامَ]{.ar} has no state and thus needs no governor.
So it is, itself, the initial governor.

DIAGRAM

#### Another (non-;3umdah;) element is the initial governor {.unnumbered}

The intitial governor may be internal to the sentence but not one of the two ;3umdah; elements.
In such cases,
even though the initial governor is not one of the two ;3umdah; elements,
we don't call it an ;fadlah; element.

Here are some examples:

(@) [لَمْ يَضْرِبِ الرَّجُلُ غُلَامَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [@owens_foundations_grammar@ §2.2.3, 41]{.citex}  
    [The man did not beat Zayd's slave.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM
    
<!--
(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was standing.]{.trans}

DIAGRAM

In example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above,
the verb [كَانَ]{.ar} is the initial governor.
But because it is a ;naqis; verb, it does not complete the sentence grammatically.
Therefore, it is not an ;3umdah; element.
But it is needed to govern the ;3umdah; elements.
-->

#### The abstract initial governor {.unnumbered}

Very commonly, the initial governor is not an actual word, but only an abstract concept.
When there is one or more stateful ;3umdah; elements in a sentence with no overt (i.e. observable) governor,
then this necessitates bringing in a _abstract_ initial governor.^[@owens_foundations_grammar@ 55; @peled_sentence_types@ 87--88]
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 87]{.citex}  
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}

The abstract initial governor governs both the ;muxbar3; (the ;mubtada; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}),
and the ;muxbar; (the ;xabar; 
[مُنْطَلِقٌ]{.ar})
in the ;ustate;.

(@) [يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd stands]{.trans}

The abstract initial governor governs the ;muxbar; (the ;mudarie; verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar}) in the ;ustate;.
And, as usual, the verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar} governs its ;faa3il; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} (the ;muxbar3;) in the ;ustate;.

<!--

#### An external element as the initial governor {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, it is possible for an element that is external to the sentence under question, to be its initial governor.
We will learn moe about this case in sections\ (ref) and (ref) below.
-->

<!--
(@) zaydun DAribun abUhu eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, ;ia;.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example, the smaller sentence is
DAribun abUhu eamran
"His father is beating eamr."
The ;ism_fail; DAribun governs the its ;faa3il; abUhu,
and its ;mafulb; 3amr.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an ;ism_fail; may have a ;faa3il; and a ;mafulb;.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the ;ustate; because it is the ;xabar; of the ;mubtada; zaydun.
by the conceptual governor that governs the larger sentence.

(@) inna zaydan DAribun eamran

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, ;ia;.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the initial governor is the particle inna.
It governs its ;ism_of; zaydun in the ;astate;.
And it governs its ;xabar; DAribun in the ;ustate;.
However, its ;xabar; 
the smaller sentence is
DAribun eamran
"He is beating eamr."
The ;ism_fail; DAribun governs
and its ;mafulb; 3amr,
(and also its implied ;faa3il; "he").
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an ;ism_fail; may have a ;faa3il; and a ;mafulb;.)
But DAribun is a stateful element that itself needs a governor.
It is put in the ;ustate; because it is the ;xabar; of the initial governor inna.
-->

<!--
(@) kāna Zaydun munṭaliqan ʾabūhu
    [peled 207 citing zajjaji]{.citex}

DIAGRAM

This is an example of a nested sentence.
We will study these types of sentences in more detail in later sections, ;ia;.
For now, we will give a brief overview specific to this example.

In the above example,
the initial governor of the outer sentence is the verb kaana.
It governs its ;faa3il; zaydun in the ;ustate;.
And it governs its ;xabar; muntaliqan in the ;astate;.
However,
muntaliqan and its ;faa3il; abUhu
also constitute a sentence by themselves.
This is the inner sentence within the outer sentence.
This inner sentence 
muntaliqan abuhu
has two ;3umdah; elements: 
the ;ism_fail; muntaliq,
and its ;faa3il; abUhu.
(Remember from section\ (ref) that an ;ism_fail; can have a ;faa3il;)
muntaliq governs abUhu.
But muntaliq itself is also governed by an initial governor (the verb kaana) that is not in this inner sentence.
-->
<!--
#### More than one element in the initial government {.unnumbered}

Sometimes, there may be more than one element (in a chain) in the initial government, before one reaches the first governed ;3umdah; element.
For example:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the ;0state;.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a ;naqis; verb, is not an ;3umdah; element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the ;muxbar3; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the ;ustate;
and the ;muxbar; [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the ;astate;.
Therefore [يَكُنْ]{.ar} is part of the initial government.
-->

## #;fadlah; elements

A ;fadlah; element is any stateful element in a sentence that is not either of the two ;3umdah; elements,
or part of the initial government.
The source of government for 
a ;fadlah; element must be,
directly or indirectly,
one of the ;3umdah; elements.
By the way,
when we say _;fadlah;_,
we mean that it is ;fadlah; in the sense that it is not required to complete the sentence _grammatically_.
We don't mean that it is superfluous in terms of its meaning.
In fact, a ;fadlah; element may be essential for the correct meaning of the sentence.
For example, consider the ;ayah;:

(@) [لاعبين]{.ar}
    [ cited by maani_nahw]{.citex}


[لاعبين]{.ar} is a ;hal; (see in chapter\ (ref)),
which is a ;fadlah; element.
If we remove it from the sentence,
then the sentence will be complete grammatically but it will have an incorrect meaning.

We will discuss some of ;fadlah; elements below:

#### The ;astate; governees of a verb {.unnumbered}

The most prominent ;fadlah; elements are 
all ;astate; elements that a verb governs.
These include:

* the ;mafulb;
* the ;mmutlaq; (see chapter\ (ref))
* the ;dharf_zaman; and the ;dharf_makan; (see chapter\ (ref))
* the ;mafull; (see chapter\ (ref))
* the ;mafulm; (see chapter\ (ref))
* the ;hal; (see chapter\ (ref))
* the ;tamyiz; (see chapter\ (ref))

The ;mafulb; is usually a ;fadlah; element.
In most sentences, if we remove the ;mafulb; the sentence remains grammatically complete.
For example:

However, if a verb is ;naqis;
(for example [كَانَ]{.ar}),
then its ;mafulb; is renamed to be the ;xabar;

We saw an example of this in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.

#### The ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah; {.unnumbered}

Technically,
the ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah; is considered a ;fadlah; unit.
Consider the following example:

(@) abU zaydin axU eamrin

If we remove the ;mudafil; nouns from the sentence we get:

(@) al-abu al-axu

This is a complete sentence.
al-abu is the ;mubtada;.
And al-axu is the ;xabar; (the ;muxbar;).

However, for convenience, we will often (loosely) treat
the annexation as one unit.
So we may say that the ;mubtada; is
abu zaydin
and that the ;muxbar; is axu 3amr.

#### The ;tabi3;s {.unnumbered}

The ;tabi3;s are considered ;fadlah; elements.
These include:

* The ;na3t; (see chapter\ (ref))
* The ;badal; (see chapter\ (ref))
* The ;tawkeed; (see chapter\ (ref))
* The ;3atf_bayan; (see chapter\ (ref))

## Defining the ;j_ism; and the ;j_f3l;

We know that there are two basic types of Arabic sentences:

 i. The ;j_ism;
ii. The ;j_f3l;

Previously we had said that a ;j_ism; is one that begins with a noun.
And a ;j_ism; is one that begins with a verb.
We will now refine these definitions:

A _;j_ism;_ is one whose first ;3umdah; element is a noun.
And
a _;j_f3l;_ is one whose first ;3umdah; element is a verb.
Consider, for example, the following sentence:

(@) [بَلْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Rather Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence above is [بَلْ]{.ar}.
It is a particle and not a ;3umdah; element.
Removing it from the sentence, we see that the first of the remaining ;3umdah; elements is [زَيْدٌ]{.ar},
which is a noun. So the sentence is a ;j_ism;.

Let's take a look at another example:

(@) [زَيْدًا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 28]{.citex}  
    [[It was] Zayd I saw.]{.trans}

The first word in the sentence is [زَيْدًا]{.ar}.
It is a ;mafulb;.
We will learn in section\ (ref) below that ;mafulb;s are not usually ;3umdah; elements.
They are usually ;fadlah; elements.
Stripping the sentence of its ;fadlah; elements we are left with
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} [I saw]{.trans}.
This is a ;j_f3l;.

## The hybrid sentence

Some sentences do not fall neatly into the categories of a ;j_ism; or a ;j_f3l;.
We will refer to such sentences as hybrid sentences.

One example of a hybrid sentence is one that has the verb [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Example:

(@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) [كَانَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 171]{.citex}  
    [Zayd was standing]{.trans}

[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above is the ;muxbar3;, as usual.
But
[كَانَ]{.ar}, above,
is a ;naqis; verb
(see chapter\ (ref).)
This means that it does not have sufficient meaning to grammatically complete the sentence by itself.
So it cannot be a ;3umdah; element.
So
[كَانَ]{.ar}
requires a ;xabar; 
([قَائِمًا]{.ar} above)
to be the ;muxbar;.

In such a sentence,
[كَانَ]{.ar}
can be considered to be the initial governor, and the sentence may be considered a ;j_ism;.

Similarly consider the sentence:

(@) [لَمْ يَكُنْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا]{.ar}  
    [Zayd was not standing.]{.trans}

In the example above,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs the verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar} in the ;0state;.
The verb [يَكُنْ]{.ar}, being a ;naqis; verb, is not an ;3umdah; element.
But [يَكُنْ]{.ar} governs the ;muxbar3; [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} in the ;ustate;
and the ;muxbar; [قَائِمًا]{.ar} in the ;astate;.
Therefore both [لَمْ]{.ar} and [يَكُنْ]{.ar} form the initial government.

[كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).

<!--
Similarly, consider the sentence:

(@) [ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا]{.ar}
    [@peled_sentence_types@ 171]{.citex}  
    [I believed him [to be] standing.]{.trans}

The sentence above begins with the verb [ظَنَّ]{.ar},
which would normally make this a ;j_f3l;.
But the sentence with just the verb and its ;faa3il; 
[ظَنَنْتُ]{.ar}
[I believed]{.trans}
seems incomplete.

[ظَنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters are discussed in more detail in chapters\ (ref).
-->

We will see another example of a hybrid sentence in section\ (aqaaimun zaydun).

## Identifying the ;3umdah; elements

### Identifying the ;3umdah; elements in a ;j_f3l;

Identifying the ;3umdah; elements in a ;j_f3l; is relatively straightforward.
The ;muxbar3; is always the ;faa3il; of the verb.
And 
except in the case of a ;naqis; verb,
the ;muxbar; is usually the verb.
We saw an example of the ;3umdah; elements of a ;j_f3l; in example (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) above.

In the case of a ;naqis; verb,
like [كَانَ]{.ar},
the verb does not complete the sentence grammatically.
So the ;mafulb; of the verb becomes the ;muxbar;.
We saw an example of the ;3umdah; elements of a ;j_f3l; with a ;naqis; verb in example (@kaana_zaydun_qaaiman) above.
-->

## Identifying the ;3umdah; elements in a ;j_ism;

Identifying the ;3umdah; elements in a ;j_ism; can sometimes be complicated.
We will discuss several cases below:

### A particle is the initial governor

### One ;3umdah; element is definite and the other ;3umdah; element is indefinite

### Both ;3umdah; elements are definite

### Both ;3umdah; elements are indefinite

## The compound sentence

## The ;damir_shan;

## FINI

## Sentence types

As we already know,
there are two basic types of sentences in Arabic:

 i. The ;j_ism;
ii. The ;j_f3l;

In its basic form,
the ;j_ism;'s two ;3umdah; elements are a ;ism_of; and a ;xabar;.
The ;ism_of; constitutes the ;muxbar3; of the sentence.
The ;xabar; constitutes the ;muxbar; and completes the sentence grammatically by expressing some property about the ;ism_of;.

The ;j_f3l;, in its basic form, consists of a verb and its ;faa3il; as its two ;3umdah; elements.
The ;faa3il; constitutes the ;muxbar3; of the sentence.
The verb constitutes the ;muxbar; and completes the sentence grammatically by expressing some property about the ;faa3il;.

Examples (@3amal_zayd_qaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
and (@3amal_qaama_zaydun) [قَامَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} above are examples of a ;j_ism; and a ;j_f3l; respectively.

## The anchoring element

In addition to the ;3umdah; elements, and the initial governor,
some, but not all, sentences also require a _anchoring_ element [peled 140].
The anchoring element serves as an anchor to start the sentence and justify its structure.
It may either be a part of the sentence or external to it.
The anchoring element, when needed, cannot be either of the two ;3umdah; elements.
Rather, it must precede the two ;3umdah; elements in word-order.
Here are some examples:

(@) aqaaimun zaydun

In this example, the anchoring element is the question particle 'a'.
It allows us to order the sentence as 'qaaimun zaydun'.
Without it, the normal order would have been zaydun qaaimun.

(@) Zaydun munṭaliqun ʾabūhu
    [peled 207 citing zajjaji]{.citex}

In this example, the noun zaydun is the anchoring element to the inner sentence
muntaliqun abuhu.
By itself, the sentence muntaliqun abuhu, though grammatically correct, wouldn't typically be used.
The preceding noun Zayd is not part of the inner sentence muntaliqun abuhu.
Yet it serves as its anchoring element.

Not all sentences require an anchoring element.
Here are examples of sentences which do not require an anchoring element:

(@) zaydun qaaimun

(@) yantaliqu abUhu

## The two types of sentences

There are two types of sentences in the Arabic grammatical model:

 i. The ;j_ism;
ii. The ;j_f3l;

We have previously defined the two types of sentences thus:

A _;j_ism;_ typically begins with a noun. It has a ;mubtada; and a ;xabar;.
A _;j_f3l;_ begins with a verb.

These definitions lack some rigor.
We will attempt to refine these definitions below:

<!--
::: {#def-j_f3l}

In a ;j_f3l; the ;muxbar3; is a ;faa3il;.
It must be preceded and governed by the ;muxbar;.
The ;muxbar; may be either a verb, or a verb-like noun that is allowed to govern a ;faa3il;.

:::

::: {#def-j_ism}

In a ;j_ism; the ;muxbar3; is not a ;faa3il;. It is called the ;mubtada;.
The ;muxbar; is called the ;xabar;. It may be either a noun, or an inner sentence.

:::
-->

#### The ;j_f3l; {.unnumbered}

A _;j_f3l;_ has a ;faa3il; as its ;muxbar3;.
<!--
In a _;j_f3l;_,
the ;muxbar3; is a _;faa3il;_
-->
The ;faa3il; is preceded by its governor.
The ;faa3il;'s governor may either be a verb, or a verb-like noun that can govern a ;faa3il;.
<!--
the ;muxbar3; shall be a _;faa3il;_.
The ;faa3il;'s governor shall precede the ;faa3il; and be internal to the sentence.
The ;faa3il;'s governor shall be either a verb, or a verb-like noun that is allowed to govern a ;faa3il;.
-->

In a _;j_f3l;_,
the ;faa3il;'s governor will often, but not always, be the ;muxbar; of the sentence.
If the ;faa3il;'s governor is not meaningfully sufficient to be the ;muxbar;,
then it will, in its stead, also govern a
_;xabar;_ (as the ;muxbar;) in order to complete the sentence grammatically.
<!--
then a _;xabar;_ is required as the ;muxbar; to complete the sentence grammatically.
-->
<!--
sufficiently express a  the ;muxbar3;, then the sentence shall require a another element, the _;xabar;_, to be the ;muxbar;.
If the ;faa3il;'s governor is not the ;muxbar;, then the sentence shall require a another element, the _;xabar;_, to be the ;muxbar;.
-->

#### The ;j_ism; {.unnumbered}

The _;j_ism;_ does not have a ;faa3il; as its ;muxbar3;.
<!--
In a _;j_ism;_ the ;muxbar3; shall not be a ;faa3il;.
The ;muxbar3; shall not governed by a verb or a verb-like noun as a ;faa3il;.
The ;muxbar3; is called the _;mubtada;_ of its governor.
-->
The ;muxbar3; is a noun governed by an initial governor.
The ;muxbar3; will require a _;xabar;_ as the ;muxbar;.


We will also define the ;xabar;:

#### The ;xabar; {.unnumbered}

The _;xabar;_, when required, shall fulfil the role of the ;muxbar; of a sentence.
<!--
The ;xabar; may be either a noun, or an inner sentence.
-->
The ;xabar; is,
in principle,
a noun.
But an inner sentence may occur _in the place_^[Peled 91 citing ibn abi l-rabI3] of the ;xabar;.


<!--
From the above definitions we can infer the following:

::: {#cor-verb-sentence}

The verb can only occur, with its ;faa3il;, in a ;j_f3l; sentence.

:::
-->

Let's go through some examples and try to classify them according to the above definitions.

## Determining the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar;


<!--
In a ;j_f3l;, determining the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; is relatively straightforward.
The ;muxbar3; is the ;faa3il; and the ;muxbar; is the element which completes the sentence by expresses a property about the ;muxbar3;.
However, in a ;j_ism; determining the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; can be a little complicated.
-->
The terms
;muxbar3;,
;muxbar;,
;faa3il;,
;3aamil;,
;xabar;,
etc.
are syntatical terms.
But they are determined using syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

In terms of pragmatics, the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; represent 'given' and 'new' information.
That is, the listener knows who the ;muxbar3; is and can identify him or it. So the ;muxbar3; is a 'given' to the listener.
And the speaker is providing 'new' information about the ;muxbar3; to the listener.

For example:

(@) ana tamimiyyun

In the above example, the listener already knows who the ;muxbar3; ("I") is.
And the speaker is providing new information (via the ;muxbar; "tamimiyyun") about the ;muxbar3; to the listener.
This new information is that the ;muxbar3; "is a Tamimi".

If we reverse the order of words in the sentence thus:

(@) tamimiyyun ana

then the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; remain the same.
The ;muxbar3; is ana because that is 'given' information to the listener.
And the ;muxbar; is tamimiyyun becayse that represents 'new' information for the listener.

<!--
So much for the pragmatic perspective.

From the perspective of grammar, the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; are determined 
first using syntactical rules, then with semantic considerations, and finally (only when needed) using pragmatics.

Usually the synactico-semantic perspective will align with the pragmatic perspective.
But sometimes they may mis-align.
-->

Sometimes, what is pragmatically the topic of sentence, may not align with the syntactic ;muxbar3;.
Consider for example, the following sentence:

(@) zaydan ra'aytu
    [peled 28]{.citex}

Pragmatically, it may seem that zayd is the topic of the sentence because it is whom the sentence is about.
But actually zayd is the ;mafulb; of a semantically complete verb ra'A.
So zayd is a ;fadlah; element.
Stripping the sentence of the ;fadlah; elements, we are left with ra'aytu.
This is a ;j_f3l;.
The ;muxbar3; is the ;faa3il; (the pronoun tu "I").
And the ;muxbar3; is the verb ra'A.

Determining the ;muxbar3; and the ;muxbar; in a ;j_f3l; is relatively straightforward, as in example () above.
In the case of a ;j_ism; this determination can be more complicated.
We will discuss it below:

### Determining the ;mubtada; and the ;xabar; in a ;j_ism;

If the ;j_ism; has a word as the initial governor, then determining the ;mubtada; and the ;xabar; is easy.
For example:

(@) fainna Hasbaka Allah
    [@https://quran.com/8/62]{.citex}

If the initial governor is abstract then the situation can be more tricky.
Regarding the definiteness of the two ;3umdah; elements,
there are three possibilities:

  i. One is definite and the other is indefinite.
 ii. Both are definite.
iii. Both are indefinite.

#### One ;3umdah; element is definite and the other is indefinite {.unnumbered}

The first case (where one ;3umdah; element is definite and the other is indefinite) is the basic and most common case.
The definite element is typically taken as the ;mubtada; and the indefinite element is taken as the ;xabar;.^[Peled 87]
This falls in line with the pragmatic perspective which we outlined above.
The definite element represents the 'given' information, which the listener already knows.
And the indefinite element represents 'new' information.

We already gave the example () ana tamimiyyun above.
ana is definite so it is the ;mubtada;.
And tamimiyyun is indefinite so it is the ;xabar;.
This assignment holds even if we change the order to () tamimiyyun ana.

In special cases, some grammarians hold that it is possible to have an indefinite ;mubtada; and a definite ;xabar;.^[<https://alababmisr.com/%D8%B3%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE/>]
One special case is when a question noun is the ;mubtada;.
(Question nouns are considered indefinite.)
For example:

(@) [كَمْ مَالُكَ]{.ar}
    [sabban citing sibawayhi]{.citex}  

(@) [أَيُّ لَيْلَةٍ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3513@]{.citex}  
    “Which night is the night of Decree”

Another special case is when the ;mubtada; is an indefinite ;af3al; in sentences like:

(@) xayrun minka zaydun
    [sabban citing sibawayhi]{.citex}  

In the above sentence, afDalu is considered the ;mubtada; of the sentence.
Typically, an indefinite comparative noun would be a ;xabar; instead of a ;mubtada;.
For example: zaydun xayrun minka.
But imagine a scenario where someone says:
3amrun xayrun minni.
In response to this, another person may reply
xayrun minka zaydun.
The given information is xayrun minka.
And the new information is zayd.

Besides these two special cases,
there are words like
Hasb, naHw, mivl, etc.
Remember from section\ (ref) that these words (exceptionally) remain indefinite when annexed to a definite noun.
So, for example, these words (as ;mudaf;s to definite ;mudafil;s) may be used as ;na3t;s to an indefinite noun.
For example:

(@) [مررت برجل حسبك من رجل]{.ar}
    [@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 3/139]{.ar}

There is some debate amongst the grammarians with regards to whether these indefinite noun may occur as a ;mubtada; to a definite ;xabar;.^[Sabban sharh ashmooni 1/277]
So if we have a sentence: 

(@) [حسبُك زَيْدٌ]{.ar}

then one may deem zayd as the ;mubtada; because it is more definite than hasbuka.

But see also the ;tafsir;s of the following ;ayah;s:

(@) faHasbuhu jahannamu

(@) Hasbuhum jahannamu yaSlawnahA

#### Both ;3umdah; elements are definite {.unnumbered}

When both ;3umdah; elements are definite, then typically the first is the ;mubtada; and the second is the ;xabar;.
For example:

(@) al-dInu al-naSIHatu

However, if it is known from context that one if the two elements is the 'given' information and the other is the 'new' information, then the given information will be the ;mubtada; and the new information will be the ;xabar;, regardless of word-order.^[ibn_aqil 1/233, maani_nahw 1/ta3reef al mutdada wal xabar]

For example, consider a situation where one wishes to say that Abu Yusuf is [like] Abu Hanifa.
(Imam Abu Yusuf was the foremost student of Imam Abu Hanifa.)
The normal way to express this sentence is:

(@) Abu Yusuf Abu Hanifa.

DIAGRAM

However, if the speaker and the listener know that Abu Yusuf is the topic of the conversation then Abu Yusuf is the given information.
And likening him to Abu Hanifa is the new information which then speaker is giving to the listener.
With the pragamatic knowledge that the listener would know what he means,
the speaker may choose, for stylistic reasons, to place the ;xabar; (Abu Hanifa) before the ;mubtada; (Abu Yusuf)

(@) Abu Hanifa Abu Yusuf 

DIAGRAM

#### Both ;3umdah; elements are indefinite {.unnumbered}

What we have said regarding both ;3umdah; elements being indefinite also holds for when both ;3umdah; elements are indefinite.
In this case, however, given that both elements are indefinite, it may be more difficult to establish that one is the 'given' information, and the other is the 'new' information.
So the ;mubtada; will likely precede the ;xabar;.
For example:

(@) [أفضل من زيد أفضل من عمرو]{.ar}
    [ibn_aqil 1/232]{.citex}  

(@) [وَجَزَٰٓؤُا۟ سَيِّئَةٍۢ سَيِّئَةٌۭ مِّثْلُهَا ۖ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/42/40@]{citex}  
    And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it

## The compound sentence

<!--
In the definition of the ;xabar;
(section\ (ref) above)
we mentioned that the ;xabar; is,
in principle,
a noun.
But an inner sentence may occur _in the place_^[Peled 91 citing ibn abi l-rabI3] of the ;xabar;.
-->

Consider the sentence:

(@) yaqUmu zaydun

This is a simple ;j_f3l;.
zaydun is the ;faa3il; and
yaqUmu is its governor.

The word-order in () yaqoomu zaydun is the normal word-order that we would employ.
But we can also flip the word-order and say:

(@) zaydun yaqoomu

We will discuss the reasons for changing the normal word-order in more detail in chapter\ (Word-order).
For now, we will simply discuss the grammar of the new sentence.
The new sentence () zaydun yaqoom is actually no longer a simple ;j_f3l;.

Why? Because the word-order of a ;faa3il; and it's governor is strictly fixed in the Arabic grammatical model.
The ;faa3il;'s governor must precede it.
So zaydun cannot be a ;faa3il; of yaqoom.
But yaqoom is a verb, and a verb needs a ;faa3il;
The ;faa3il; of yaqoom is the ;mustatir; singular masculine pronoun (signifying "he") within the verb.
So yaqoom, by itself, is a complete ;j_f3l;.
So what, then, is Zayd?
Zayd is the ;mubtada; of a sentence, whose ;xabar; is the ;j_ism; yaqoom.

DIAGRAM

So we can see that we have
a _compound_ sentence,
consisting of
an outer sentence and an inner sentence.
A compound sentence is one that has a ;xabar; that is itself a sentence.
As opposed to compound sentences, a _simple_ sentence is one that does not contain another sentence within it.
<!--
The inner sentence is _nested_ in the outer sentence.
-->

::: {.callout-note}
Simply changing the word-order in a sentence (when permitted)
can result in a different grammar for the new sentence, compared to the original sentence.
This is a very important observation and we will make use of it later, ;ia;.
:::

### What is valid as an outer sentence

The outer sentence is often a ;j_ism; as in example () zaydun yaqoom.
But it is also possible for the outer sentence to be a ;j_f3l;.
For example:

(@) kaana zaydun yaktubu

DIAGRAM

We will study compound sentences that start with kaana in more detail in chapter\ (ref).

<!--
#### Composing a compound sentence {.unnumbered}

In example () zaydun yaqoom we created a compound sentence by flipping the word order of an original sentence.
But this is not the only way or reason to create compound sentences.
A compound sentence may be composed without being flipped from an original.
For example:
-->

### What is valid as an inner sentence

#### Both the ;j_ism; and the ;j_f3l; are valid {.unnumbered}

The ;xabar; of the outer sentence
may be either a ;j_f3l; (as in example () above),
or a ;j_ism;, as in the following example:

(@) [زيد أبوه قائم]{.ar}
    [@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/26]{.citex}

#### A ;xabari; sentence is valid {.unnumbered}

The ;xabar; is always the ;muxbar; of a sentence.
And the ;muxbar; is defined as expressing some property about the ;muxbar3;.
This property that  the ;xabar; expresses is usually ;xabari;.
For example,
in the sentence
<!--
zaydun qaaim
qaaim is the ;xabar; (and thus ;muxbar;).
The property that the ;xabar; (qaaim) expresses about zayd that he is standing.
-->
zaydun yaqoom
the inner sentence yaqoom is ;xabari;.

<!--
But this rule of expressing a property about the ;muxbar3; is relaxed for a ;xabar;s that is an inner sentence.
-->
#### A ;inshai; sentence is valid {.unnumbered}

The property that the ;xabar; expresses about the ;muxbar3; need not always be ;xabari;
(although it usually is).
Consider, for example, the simple sentence:

(@3amal_where_is_3amr) [أين عمرو؟]{.ar}
    [@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/27]{.citex}  
    "Where is [#eamr]{.trn2}?"

The ;xabar; [أَيْنَ]{.ar} of the simple sentence in example (@3amal_where_is_3amr) above is not ;xabari;.^[@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/27]{.citex}  
Yet the sentence is perfectly valid.

<!--
Similarly, 
a simple sentence, as a whole, need not be ;xabari;.
Consider, for example, the simple sentence:

(@) [أَيُّ رَجُلٍ أَخُوكَ]{.ar}
    [ibn_3usfoor_sharh_jumal 1/347]{.citex}

The entire simple sentence in example () above is not ;xabari;.^[ibn_3usfoor_sharh_jumal 1/347;]
-->
Therefore, an inner sentence, which is the ;xabar; of a compound sentence, need not be ;xabari; either.^[ibn_3usfoor_sharh_jumal 1/347; @abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/27]
So we can say:

(@) zaydun iDribhu

(@) zaydun hal darabtahu

[Ibn Abi -r-RabI3, BasIT 706]{.citex}

In examples () and () above, the inner sentence ;xabar;s are ;inshai;.
But they are valid as a ;xabar; for their outer sentences,
and due to them,
the outer sentences are grammatically complete.

#### Invalid inner sentences {.unnumbered}

Some sentences, however, are not valid as inner sentences:

* A sentence beginning with lAkin, HattA, or bal is not valid.^[@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/28]
* A vocative sentence is not valid.^[@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/28]
  So. we cannot say, for example:

  (@) ;x; [زيد يا أخاه]{.ar}
      [@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 4/28]{.citex}  
      "Zayd: O his brother."

### The ;rabt; between the inner and outer sentence

It is usually necessary for there to be a ;rabt; between the inner sentence, and the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence.
This ;rabt; is typically supplied by a pronoun.
Let's look at some examples:

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ أَبُوهُ]{.ar}
    [jurjani_muqtasid 1/278]{.citex}  

DIAGRAM

In example () above, the ;rabt; is the pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in abuuhu.

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَامَ]{.ar}
    [jurjani_muqtasid 1/278]{.citex}  

DIAGRAM

In example () above, the ;rabt; is the implied singular masculine pronoun that is the ;faa3il; of qaama.

Generally, if there is no such ;rabt; between the inner sentence and the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence,
then the compound sentence is invalid.
So we cannot say, for example:

(@) ;x; Zaydun qāma ʿAmrun  
    [peled 94 citing ibn ya3eesh; jurjani_muqtasid 1/279]{.citex}

#### A ;ism_isharah; as the ;rabt; {.unnumbered}

Instead of a pronoun,
an ;ism_isharah; may serve as the ;rabt;.
For example:

(@) [وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ]{.ar}
    [cited by ibn_uthaymeen_sharh 17/2, ibn_aqil 1/204]{.citex}  

#### A repeated ;mubtada; as the ;rabt; {.unnumbered}

The ;mubtada; of the outer sentence may be repeated in the inner sentence, and this is sufficient as the ;rabt;.
For example:

(@) [الْحَاقَّةُ * مَا الْحَاقَّةُ]{.ar}
    [cited by ibn_uthaymeen_sharh 17/2, ibn_aqil 1/204]{.citex}  

#### No need for the ;rabt; {.unnumbered}

In cases where the ;xabar; of the outer sentence is more general than its ;mubtada; a ;rabt; is not needed.
For example:

(@) zaydun ni3ma al-rajulu
    [@wright@ 2/256D, ibn_aqil 1/204]{.citex}

The ;rabt; is also not needed when the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence and its ;xabar; are perfectly identical in meaning.
For example:

(@) [نطقي الله حسبي]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/256D, ibn_aqil 1/204]{.citex}

(@) [قولي لا إله إلا الله]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/256D, ibn_aqil 1/204]{.citex}

#### An implied ;rabt; {.unnumbered}

The ;rabt;, even when technically required, is sometimes omitted.
But it remains implied.
This is in cases in which the sense is perfectly clear without it.^[@wright@ 2/256B]
For example:

(@) [ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar}  
    [@wright@ 2/256C; jurjani_muqtasid 1/278; radiyy 1/238]{.citex}  
    (The sentence with the ;rabt; restored is [ٱلسَّمْنُ مَنَوَانِ مِنْهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ]{.ar} "two [manA]{.trn2}s _of it_ for a dirham.")

## The pronoun of the fact

<!--

(@) zaydun muntaliqun  
    Zayd is setting out.

The word muntaliqun is the ;xabar;.
We can replace the word muntaliqun with the ;j_f3l;
yantaliqu "he sets out."

(@) zaydun yantaliqu
    Zayd sets out.

Now we have _nested_ sentences which consists of two sentences:
 i. The inner sentence yantaliqu, which 
    is a ;j_f3l; sentence, consisting of the verb and the implied ;faa3il; "he".
ii. The outer sentence which is a ;j_ism;.
    The ;mubtada; of the outer sentence is the noun zaydun.
    And the ;xabar; of the outer sentence is the inner sentence.

The ;xabar; is,
in principle,
a noun.
But an inner sentence may occur,
as in the example above,
in its stead.

### Purpose of using a nested sentence

A sentence is used as a ;xabar; to contain more information than it would be to convey in a single word.


(@) ;x; Zaydun qāma ʿAmrun  
    [peled 94 citing ibn ya3eesh]{.citex}

;3aaid; can be substituted [peled 94]
-->

## A sentence in place of a noun

The ;xabar; of a sentence is, in principle, a noun.
However, we saw in section\ (ref) above,
that a sentence may occur in place of it.
This formed a compound sentence.

This substitution of sentences for nouns can also be done for nouns that occur as other syntactical elements besides the ;xabar;.
We will discuss some of these cases here.

### A sentence as the ;na3t;

The ;na3t; is,
in principle,
a single noun.

However, an sentence entire sentence may occur in place of the single noun.
For example, instead of saying
[مررت برجل قائم]{.ar},
we can replace
the single word ;na3t;
[قائم]{.ar}
with the sentence
[يقوم]{.ar}, thus:

(@) [مررت برجل يقوم]{.ar}
    [farisi_idah 308]{.citex}  
    "I passed by a man [that was] standing."
    (literally: "I passed by a 'he [was] standing' man."

Note that the ;mudarie; verb
[يقوم]{.ar} is in the ;ustate; because [يقوم]{.ar} is governed as an independent sentence.
The state of the ;manut;
[رَجُلٍ]{.ar} has no effect on any state within the sentence-;na3t;.



Substituing a single-noun ;na3t; with its corresponding ;mudarie; verb is the most basic form of the sentence-;na3t;.
However, more complex sentence-;na3t;s may also be formed.
For example:


(@) [وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ]{.ar}
    [cited by @ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 3/277]{.citex}  
    (The ;na3t; is the sentence [تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ]{.ar}.)

Also note that when we translate such sentences into English, we need to use a _relative pronoun_ like
_that_, _which_, _who_, etc.
But in Arabic no such relative pronoun is needed or used.
Arabic does have the equivalent of the relative pronoun, called the _;ism_mawsul;_,
but it has its own use cases.
We will discuss the ;ism_mawsul; in chapter\ (ref), ;ia;.

There are three conditions that must be met in order for a sentence to occur as a ;na3t;^:
    [@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 3/275--278]{.citex}  

1. The ;manut; must be indefinite, either in wording or in meaning.
2. The sentence-;na3t; must contain a ;rabt; that links back to the ;manut;.
2. The sentence-;na3t; should be ;xabari;.

Let's discuss each of these conditions:

A more complex sentence-;na3t;

;rabt; may be deleted:
[@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 3/277]

Conditions:

manut must be indefinite.


sentence must be ;xabari;
If not ;xabari; then مقول is implied.
[@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 3/278]

### A sentence as the ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;

## The anchored ;j_f3l;

Consider the sentence:

(@) zaydun yaDribu 3amran  


For stylistic reasons, we can replcace the ;mudarie; verb 
yaDribu
with its ;ism_fail;
DAribun
thus:

(@) zaydun DAribun 3amran  
    "Zayd is beating 3amr"


(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is standing."

This is a ;j_ism;.
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is the ;mubtada;.
And
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is the ;xabar;.

For pragmatic or stylistic reasons we may wish

## [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}

In this section we will make extensive use of the example:

(@3amal_qaaimun_zaydun) [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Standing is Zayd."

Example (@3amal_qaaimun_zaydun) above represents a much discussed structure in Arabic sentence theory.
It presented a serious challenge to the grammarians' theory of government and sentence types.^[Peled 122]

### [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} analyzed as a ;j_ism;

The normal word-order for expressing this sentence is:

(@3amal_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is standing."

DIAGRAM

But the word-order of the sentence is flipped in example (@3amal_qaaimun_zaydun) [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
Again, we will discuss the stylistic reasons for changing the word-order in chapter\ (ref).

In this particular case, 
a speaker may choose to say
[قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} 
instead of the more normal
[زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
when, for example, the listener is under an incorrect impression that Zayd is sitting and the speaker wishes to correct the listener's misapprehension.^[@maani_nahw@ 1/[المبتدأ الذي له مرفوع أغني عن الخبر]{.ar}]

Anyway, for now, let's focus on the grammar of the changed sentence.
Now, we know from section\ () above that changing the order of words in a sentence (when permitted)
can result in a different grammar for the new sentence, compared to the original sentence.

As a matter of fact, for this particular sentence,
the grammatical parsing of the flipped sentence can be the same as the original sentence:

DIAGRAM

So if we change the gender or number of the ;mubtada;,
then the gender and number of the ;xabar; will also be changed to match it.
For example:

(@) [قَائِمَةٌ هِنْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Hind is standing."

<!--
(@) [قَائِمَانِ ٱلزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    "The (two) Zayds are standing."
-->

(@) [مَا قَائِمُونَ ٱلزَّيْدَونَ]{.ar}  
    "The Zayds are not standing."

(@) [أَقَائِمَتَانِ ٱلْهِنْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    "Are the (two) Hinds standing?"

So far so good.
Now let's get to the more problematic analysis:

### [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} analyzed as a ;j_f3l;

Sometimes a flipped sentence of this sort is anchored to a preceding anchoring element
(see section\ (ref) above).
For example,

(@) [أَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Is Zayd standing?"
    (The question particle [أَ]{.ar} is the anchoring element.)

(@) [مَا قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is not standing."
    (The negative particle [مَا]{.ar} is the anchoring element.)

The anchoring element is usually a question particle 
or a negative particle^[Peled 143]
(as in examples () and () above).
But we will see in section\ (overlapping sentences) below, that it may even be an element of a previous sentence.

Now, with this anchoring element,
another grammatical parsing is possible.^[Peled 140]
The ;ism_fail;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is a verb-like noun.
In fact, it is the closest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns to the ;mudarie; verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar}.^[Peled 122]
This resemblance of the ;ism_fail; to the verb allows it to
serve as the governor of the ;muxbar3;
its ;faa3il;.
And the ;muxbar3;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
can now be parsed as a ;faa3il;.
And the sentence becomes a ;j_f3l;.

As for the governor of the (stateful) ;muxbar;
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar},
it is governed by an abstract governor,
just as if it had been the ;mudarie; verb [يَقُومُ]{.ar}.

DIAGRAM

The proof of this analysis is that when
<!--
the ;faa3il; ;muxbar3; is feminized,
its governor is feminized to match it.

And if the 
-->
the ;faa3il; ;muxbar3; is dualized or pluralized,
its governor can remain in the singular,
just like for a verb:

(@) [أَقَائِمٌ ٱلزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    "Are the (two) Zayds standing?"

(@) [مَا قَائِمٌ ٱلزَّيْدُونَ]{.ar}  
    "The Zayds are not standing."


By the way, if
the ;faa3il; ;muxbar3; is feminized,
its governor would be feminized to match it.
This too would be done for actual verbs.
For example:

(@) [أَقَائِمَةٌ ٱلْهِنْدَانِ]{.ar}  
    "Are the (two) Hinds standing?"

Also by the way,
a speaker may choose whether to employ
[قَائِم]{.ar} as a verb
(as in examples () above),
or as a fronted ;xabar;
(as in examples () above).
If the speaker had elected to use
[قَائِم]{.ar} as a fronted ;xabar;,
then, of course, 
the ;xabar; [قَائِم]{.ar}
would match the ;mubtada; in gender and number.

<!--
So according to the ;j_f3l; analysis of (@3amal_qaaimun_zaydun) [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar},
the ;muxbar3; 
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.
is a ;faa3il; governed by
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}.
But the question remains:
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is a stateful element in the ;ustate;;
so who is its governor?
The answer is:
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is governed by an abstract governor, just as if it had been an actual verb like [يَقُومُ]{.ar}.

DIAGRAM
aqaaimun zaydun

<!--
By the way, the flipped word-order sentence (@3amal_qaaimun_zaydun) [قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
is not 
would require a anchoring element
-->

### Traditional analysis of [قَائِمٌ ٱلزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}

Traditionally, grammarians have analyzed this challenging sentence as a kind of hybrid sentence
that has aspects of both a ;j_ism; and a ;j_f3l;.
According to this mainstream view,
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
is a ;mubtada;,
and
[ٱلزَّيْدَانِ]{.ar}
is a ;faa3il;
"substituting for the ;xabar;."^[Peled 143 citing ibn_aqil 1/189 and Carter; Peled 145]
However, not all grammarians agreed with this mainstream view.^[Peled 143 citing astarabadi 1/225]

As for us, we have attempted to make this kind of sentence fit within the Arabic grammatical model
by defining the ;j_f3l; in a way that it may begin not only with a verb, but also with a verb-like noun.

### TODO: Add ;ism_maful; + ;naib; ;faa3il;

## Overlapping sentences

Also at the edge of the Arabic grammatical model is what we will call
the case of overlapping sentences.
This is when last (stateful) element of one sentence serves as the first element of the next sentence.
In other words, the sentence has an external initial governor
(see section\ (ref) above).
It also utilizes the kind of analysis which we developed for the sentence
[قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.

Let's say we wish to express the meaning,
"Zayd's father were setting out."
The normal way to express this in Arabic would be:

(@) kaana abU zaydin munTaliqan

Now, for pragmatic, or stylistic reasons, we may wish to make Zayd the topic of the sentence.
One way to do this could be to make
make Zayd the ;ism_of; of kaana.
The ;ism_fail; muntaliq is now assigned to be the ;xabar; of kaana thus:

(@) kaana zaydun muntaliqan

But wait!
Example () above is saying that Zayd was setting out, not his father.
And where is his father anyway?
What we'll do is consider the ;ism_fail;
muntaliqan
to be a verb-like noun that can govern a ;faa3il;.
And we'll add Zayd's father as the ;faa3il; of the ;ism_fail; thus:

(@) kaana zaydun muntaliqan abawaahu

DIAGRAM

Even though
the _overlapping element_
muntaliqan
is part of the first sentence
(as its ;xabar;),
its meaning applies to the second sentence.
So it is not Zayd who is setting out, but his father.

#### The ;rabt; between the overlapping sentences {.unnumbered}

Note that,
just like in the case of the compound sentence,
overlapping sentences also require a ;rabt; in the second sentence
that points back to the first sentence.
In example () above, the ;rabt; is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in [أَبُوهُ]{.ar}, that points back to Zayd.
However,
But this ;rabt; does not necessarily point back to the ;muxbar3; of the first sentence.
It will point back to the _original_ referent of the overlapping element.
That is, the referent of the overlapping element, had the second sentence not been there.
It example () above,
if the second sentence had not been there,
the overlapping element
muntaliqan
would refer to
zayd.
So the ;rabt; points back to zayd.

In this sentence
the original referent
of the 
overlapping element
also happens to be the ;muxbar3; of the first sentence.
But in section\ (ref) below, we will see cases where it need not be so.

#### The anchoring element for the overlapping element {.unnumbered}

By the way, remember in section\ (ref) above,
we said that the verb-like noun can govern a ;faa3il; when anchored by an anchoring element.
For overlapping sentences, the overlapping element is the verb-like noun.
It is anchored by its being a syntactical part of the first sentence.
In our example,
muntaliqan
is anchored by bain a ;xabar; of the first sentence
kaana zaydun muntaliqan.^[But see also peled 208]

#### The effect of gender and number on the overlapping element {.unnumbered}

Just like in section\ (ref) above,
the verb-like noun that is the overlapping element will remain in the singular,
regardless of the number of its ;faa3il;,
or of the number of its original referent.
It will however modify for gender to match the gender of the ;faa3il;.

Here are examples of some possibilities:

(@) kāna l-Zaydāni munṭaliqan ʾabawāhumā
    [Peled 208]{.citex}

(@) kāna l-Zaydūna ḥisānan ʾābāʾuhum
    [Peled 208 fn]{.citex}

(@) kāna zaydun munṭaliqan ʾabawāhumā

(@) kāna l-Zaydāni munṭaliqan mu3allimuhuma

(@) kānat hindun munṭaliqan abUhu

(@) kānat hindun munṭaliqatan UmmuhA

(@) kānat alhindAni munṭaliqatan UmmAhumA

(@) kānat alhindAni munṭaliqan AbawAhu

zaydun DAribun abUhu 3amran

#### A non-overlapping compound sentence instead of an overlapping sentence {.unnumbered}

Instead of using an overlapping sentence, we can instead choose to use a compound sentence to express the same meaning:

(@) kaana zaydun muntaliqun abUhu
    [Peled 208]{.citex}

Here muntaliqun abUhu is an inner sentence with a fronted ;xabar;
And the inner sentence is the ;xabar; of the outer sentence.^[See Peled 209 fn 35]
DIAGRAM

If we were to change the number of the inner sentence's ;mubtada; then its ;xabar; would follow suit:

(@) kāna al-Zaydāni munṭaliqāni ʾabawāhumā
    [Peled 208]{.citex}

(@) kāna zaydun munṭaliqāni ʾabawāhumā

## The overlapping ;na3t;

Overlapping sentences are very common for one particular case,
called the _overlapping ;na3t;_.
Consider the following example:

(@3amal_na3t_sababi_saw_man_brother_handsome) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا حَسَنًا أَخُوهُ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/283C]  
    "I saw a man [whose] brother is handsome."

This is a case of overlapping sentences.
The word
[حَسَنًا]{.ar}
is originally a ;na3t;
for the ;manut;
[رَجُلًا]{.ar}
in the first sentence.
But it is also the overlapping element that begins the second sentence
and serves as the governing verb-like noun for the ;faa3il;
[أَخُوهُ]{.ar}.

DIAGRAM

Note that,
as we mentioned above,
the ;rabt;,
which is the pronoun [ه]{.ar} in 
[أَخُوهُ]{.ar},
doesn't point to the ;muxbar3; of the first sentence
(which is the pronoun [تُ]{.ar} ("I") in
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}).
Rather, it points to the _original_ referent of the overlapping element,
i.e. whom the overlapping element
[حَسَنًا]{.ar}
would be referring to, if the second sentence were not there.
In this case it is the original ;manut;
[رَجُلًا]{.ar}.

We already know that a ;na3t; must match its ;manut; in four aspects:

  i. number
 ii. gender
iii. state
 iv. definiteness

As for number,
because the ;na3t; is acting as a verb and governing an expressed ;faa3il;
it will remain in the singular
regardless of the number of its ;faa3il;,
or of the number of its original referent.

And as for gender, the ;na3t; will match the ;faa3il;, not the original referent.
This is because, again, it is acting as a verb and a verb matches its ;faa3il; in gender.

But as for state,
then a (stateful i.e. ;mudarie;) verb's state is not governed by its ;faa3il;.
Since the overlapping member is part of the first sentence,
it will be governed (in its state) by whatever would govern it, if the second sentence were not there.
In the case of a ;na3t;,
we learned in section\ (ref) above,
that it is governed by the governor of its ;manut;.
So the overlapping member will match its original referent in state.

And as for definiteness,
then a real verb has no definiteness.
So here too it will match its original referent, i.e., the original ;manut;.

Here are some examples of overlapping ;na3t;s:

(@3amal_na3t_sababi_man_brother_handsome) [جَاءَنِي رَجُلٌ حَسَنٌ أَخُوهُ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/283B]

...

[فاقع لونها]{.ar}

[القرية الظالم أهلها]{.ar}

[سَائِغٌ شَرَابُهُ]{.ar}

#### A non-overlapping sentence-;na3t; instead of an overlapping ;na3t; {.unnumbered}

Instead of using an overlapping ;na3t;, we can instead choose to use a sentence-;na3t; to express the same meaning.
So instead of saying (@3amal_na3t_sababi_saw_man_brother_handsome)
[رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا حَسَنًا أَخُوهُ]{.ar}
we can say:

(@3amal_na3t_sent_saw_man_brother_handsome) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا أَخُوهُ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/284D]

In example (@3amal_na3t_sent_saw_man_brother_handsome) above,
[حَسَنٌ]{.ar}
is not an overlapping element.
Rather,
[أَخُوهُ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}
is an independent ;j_ism; functioning as a sentence-;na3t;.
That is why 
[حَسَنٌ]{.ar} is in the ;ustate;, because it is governed only as a ;xabar; within the sentence-;na3t;.
It is not governed by
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}.

If we were to change the number of the inner sentence's ;mubtada; then its ;xabar; would follow suit:

(@3amal_na3t_sent_saw_man_brother_handsome) [رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا أَخَواهُ حَسَنَانِ]{.ar}
    [@wright@ 2/284D]

For the overlapping ;na3t;,
[حَسَن]{.ar} would remain in the singular.
