# Sentence and government theory

## Introduction


## Basic components of the sentence

There are two types of sentences in Arabic:

 i. The ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence.
    It begins with a noun.
    For example:

    (@) [زَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd is a man."
<!--
    (@) [زَيْدٌ كَتَبَ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd, he wrote."
-->

ii. The verbal sentence.
    It begins with a verb.
    For example:

    (@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd wrote."

Particles like [وَ]{.ar} "and", [مَا]{.ar} are allowed to precede the sentences
(if applicable)
without affecting their being a
;mubtada;-;xabar;
or verbal sentence.
So [وَزَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar} is still a 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
sentence.
And 
[مَا كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} "Zayd did not write" is a verbal sentence.

The Arabic sentence,
(whether a
;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence,
or a verbal sentence)
has two basic components:

 i. The _;musnadi;_
ii. The _;musnad;_

The _;musnadi;_
and
the _;musnad;_
complement each other.
The ;musnadi; provides support to the ;musnad;.
And the ;musnad; relies upon the ;musnadi;.

In the 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
the ;mubtada; is the ;musnadi;.
And the ;xabar; is the ;musnad;.

And in the verbal sentence,
the ;faa3il; is the ;musnadi;.
And the verb is the ;musnad;.

The _;musnadi;_
and
the _;musnad;_
are the two _;3umdah;_ components of a sentence, without which the sentence is not complete.
Any other components that are added are considered _;fadlah;_.

Consider the following example:

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ كِتَابًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote a book."

In the above example, the ;mafulb; [كِتًابًا]{.ar} is considered a ;fadlah; component.
If we remove it from the sentence, the sentence remains grammatically complete.

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote."

By the way,
a ;fadlah; component 
is not necessary to make a sentence grammatically complete.
But it may affect the meaning drastically.

Consider the following example:

(@government-not-see-zayd) [مَا رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    "I did not see Zayd."

If we remove the ;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar}, the sentence is grammatically complete but will have a very different meaning from the original:

(@) [مَا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}  
    "I did not see."

## The theory of government

We know that nouns and ;mudarie; verbs have a concept called _state_.
When such a _stateful_ element is in a sentence, it will be in a particular state.
But how do we know in which state we should put a stateful element?
To determine this we use the theory of _government_.

The theory of government states that every stateful element is governed by a _governor_.
And that governor determines what state the stateful element will be in.
The element governed by a governor is called a _governee_.
For example,
the rule for the government of a ;mafulb; is that the
;mafulb; is governed typically by a verb.
And the verb governs the
;mafulb; in the ;astate;.

So when we say (@government-not-see-zayd) [مَا رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا]{.ar} 
then the verb
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} is the governor of the
;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar} and governs it in the ;astate;.
We can also say that
the ;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar}
is the governee of the governor
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}.

Similarly,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs a ;mudarie; verb in the ;istate;.
So if we say [لَمْ يَذْهَبْ زَيْدٌ]{.ar},
then [لَمْ]{.ar} is the governor of the governee 
[يَذْهَبْ]{.ar}.

In a similar manner, other stateful elements like
the ;mubtada;,
the ;xabar;,
the ;faa3il;,
the ;mudafi;,
etc.
will have governors that are discussed in the literature.^[See @liheibi_sentence@]

## The government of the preposition

It is not just stateful elements that are governed


## Adding ;fadlah; elements to a sentence: the theory of government

In order to add
_stateful_
;fadlah; elements to a sentence,
Arabic grammatical theory states that their must be
a governor

Some fact.^[@liheibi_sentence@ 245]

Sometimes the ;3aamil; is required to be implicit.
For example:

(@) [عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ]{.ar}  
    "on a great existing^from\ the\ two\ cities^ man"

The fundamental structure is "on a great existing man,"
where "great" and "existing" are the ;na3t;s.
Then the ;shibh_jumlah; 
[مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
is added as a ;ma3mul; of the conceptual ;3aamil; "existing."
