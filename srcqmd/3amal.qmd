# Sentence and government theory

## Introduction


## Basic elements of the sentence

There are two types of sentences in Arabic:

 i. The ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence.
    It begins with a noun.
    For example:

    (@) [زَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd is a man."
<!--
    (@) [زَيْدٌ كَتَبَ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd, he wrote."
-->

ii. The verbal sentence.
    It begins with a verb.
    For example:

    (@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd wrote."

Particles like [وَ]{.ar} "and", [مَا]{.ar} are allowed to precede the sentences
(if applicable)
without affecting their being a
;mubtada;-;xabar;
or verbal sentence.
So [وَزَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar} is still a 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
sentence.
And 
[مَا كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} "Zayd did not write" is a verbal sentence.

The Arabic sentence,
(whether a
;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence,
or a verbal sentence)
has two basic elements:

 i. The _;musnadi;_
ii. The _;musnad;_

The ;musnadi;
and
the ;musnad;
complement each other.
The ;musnadi; provides support to the ;musnad;.
And the ;musnad; relies upon the ;musnadi;.

In the 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
the ;mubtada; is the ;musnadi;.
And the ;xabar; is the ;musnad;.

And in the verbal sentence,
the ;faa3il; is the ;musnadi;.
And the verb is the ;musnad;.

ADD DIAGRAM

The ;musnadi;
and
the ;musnad;
are the two _;3umdah;_ elements of a sentence, without which the sentence is not complete.
Any other elements that are added are considered _;fadlah;_.

Consider the following example:

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ كِتَابًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote a book."

In the above example, the ;mafulb; [كِتًابًا]{.ar} is considered a ;fadlah; element.
If we remove it from the sentence, the sentence remains grammatically complete.

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote."

By the way,
even though a ;fadlah; element 
is not necessary to make a sentence grammatically complete,
removing it may affect the meaning drastically.

Consider the following example:

(@government-not-see-zayd) [مَا رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    "I did not see Zayd."

If we remove the ;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar}, the sentence is grammatically complete but will have a very different meaning from the original:

(@) [مَا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}  
    "I did not see."

## The theory of government

We know that nouns and ;mudarie; verbs have a concept called _state_.
When such a _stateful_ element is in a sentence, it will be in a particular state.
But how do we know in which state we should put a stateful element?
To determine this we use the theory of _government_.^[@liheibi_sentence@ 107]

The theory of government states that every stateful element is governed by a _governor_.
(An element may be governed by only one governor. One governor may, however, may govern multiple separate elements.)
And that governor determines what state the stateful element will be in.
The element governed by a governor is called a _governee_.
For example,
the rule for the government of a ;mafulb; is that the
;mafulb; is governed typically by a verb.
And the verb governs the
;mafulb; in the ;astate;.

So when we say (@government-not-see-zayd) [مَا رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا]{.ar} 
then the verb
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} is the governor of the
;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar} and governs it in the ;astate;.
We can also say that
the ;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar}
is the governee of the verb
[رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}.

In a similar manner, other stateful elements like
the ;mubtada;,
the ;xabar;,
the ;faa3il;,
the ;mudafil;,
etc.
will have governors that are discussed in the literature.^[@liheibi_sentence@ chapter\ 4, @owens_foundations_grammar@ chapter\ 2]

In this chapter we will discuss governing the ;mafulb;, the preposition, and the ;mudafil;.
We will not discuss
governing
the ;mubtada;,
the ;xabar;,
and
the ;faa3il;,
because we deem it of less practical value. The interested reader may refer to the above-mentioned resources for them.
And for other stateful elements, like adverbs, we will discuss their government in their respective chapters, ;ia;.


<!--
Similarly,
the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} governs a ;mudarie; verb in the ;istate;.
So if we say [لَمْ يَذْهَبْ زَيْدٌ]{.ar},
then th particle [لَمْ]{.ar} is the governor of the ;istate; ;mudarie; verb 
[يَذْهَبْ]{.ar}.

In a similar manner, other stateful elements like
the ;mubtada;,
the ;xabar;,
the ;faa3il;,
the ;mudafil;,
etc.
will have governors that are discussed in the literature.^[See @liheibi_sentence@]

## The government of the preposition

It is not just stateful elements that are governed


## Adding ;fadlah; elements to a sentence: the theory of government

In order to add
_stateful_
;fadlah; elements to a sentence,
Arabic grammatical theory states that their must be
a governor 


```yml
non-essential elements
nested sentences
```

Some fact.^[@liheibi_sentence@ 245]

Sometimes the ;3aamil; is required to be implicit.
For example:

(@) [عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ]{.ar}  
    "on a great existing^from\ the\ two\ cities^ man"

The fundamental structure is "on a great existing man,"
where "great" and "existing" are the ;na3t;s.
Then the ;shibh_jumlah; 
[مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
is added as a ;ma3mul; of the conceptual ;3aamil; "existing."

-->

## The government of the ;mafulb;

## The government of the preposition

### The need for governing the preposition

In the Arabic grammatical model, prepositional phrases are ;fadlah; elements.
In order to bring a ;fadlah; stateful element into a sentence, a suitable element of the original sentence must act as governor of the new ;fadlah; element.
For example, consider the sentence

(@) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd sat."

We would like to add the prepositional phrase
[عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
"on the ground" to the sentence, thus:

(@sentence-verb-gov-prep-zayd-sat-ground) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd sat on the ground."

In order to do this, a suitable element in the original sentence 
([جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar})
must act as the governor for the preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
The verb
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
is this suitable element.

Now, you may be thinking:
we introduced the concept of government for determining the state of an element.
But prepositions don't have state. So why should they need to be governed, and in what manner may they be governed?

This is a valid objection. 
"Governing" a preposition is definitively problematic.^[@owens_foundations_grammar@ 177]
However, we can work around this problem with the following reasoning:

<!--
The preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is followed by the
[ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
in the ;istate;.
-->
The noun
[ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
is governed by the preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
and not directly by the verb
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
This is because it is the preposition which _causes_ the noun following it to be in the ;istate;.
In order to bring the ;fadlah; (stateful) element
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}
in the sentence,
we have to establish an unbroken chain of ;3aamil;-;ma3mul; dependencies that links back to a governing element in the original sentence.
Saying that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
allows us to accomplish this.
So
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
will govern
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
And
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
will govern
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}.

ADD DIAGRAM

<!--
([جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}).
it has to be by means of its governor
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
So if we say that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
then this allows us to establish the necessary link of dependencies

So saying that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
allows us to have a (necessarily) unbroken dependency of governorns to add the ;fadlah; (and stateful) element 
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}.
-->

### The ;zaaid; preposition does not need a governor

### Valid governors of the preposition

The verb is the typical governor of the preposition.
We have already given an example of a verb governing a prepostion: (@sentence-verb-gov-prep-zayd-sat-ground) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}.
Besides the verb, nouns that have the effect of a verb may also govern the preposition.
Such nouns include:

##### The ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

Also included are ;mushtaqq; nouns like:

##### The ;ism_fail; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;ism_maful; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;sifah_mush; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;sighah_mub;s {.unnumbered}

##### The ;af3al; {.unnumbered}

<!--
Even ;mushtaqq; nouns that don't typically govern a ;mafulb; 
(like the ;ism_zaman; and the ;ism_makan;)
are permitted to govern a preposition^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/440 citing @sabban@ 2/443. But [#abU #HayyAn]{.trn2} did not allow this (see ).]:
-->

Grammarians differ regarding whether the 
the ;ism_zaman; and the ;ism_makan;
are permitted to govern a preposition.
Some grammarians allow them to govern prepositions.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/440 citing @sabban@ 2/443]
Others disagree.^[@ibn_jinni_khasaais@ 2/209]
Here are examples (considering them permissible) as governors:

##### The ;ism_zaman; {.unnumbered}

(@) [انقضى مسعاك لتأييد الحق]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/440]{.citex}  
    "Your [period of] effort for aiding the truth has ended."

##### The ;ism_makan; {.unnumbered}

(@) [رأيت مدخلك إلى الدار]{.ar}
    [@sabban@ 2/443]{.citex}  
    "I saw your [place of] entrance to the house."


Also permitted as governorns are ;jamid; nouns used with an adjectival meaning.
For example:

### One governor governing multiple prepositions

One governor can govern multiple different prepositions with no problems.
For example:

But if the multiple governees are the same prepositon, then in general they may not be governed by the same governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444 footnote 3]
So we can't say:

(@) ;x; [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِعَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [@tasreeh_hashiyat_yasin@ 1/378]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Zayd by [#eamr]{.trn2}"  
    (although, separting the second preposition with a ;3atf; is of course allowed: [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَبِعَمْرٍو]{.ar}.)

But if the same preposition is used with different meanings then it is permissible to have them being governed by the same governor.
For example:

(@) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِٱلْبَادِيَةِ]{.ar}
    [@tasreeh_hashiyat_yasin@ 1/378]{.citex}  
    "I passed _by_ Zayd _in_ the desert."

If the first preposition restricts the verb, and the second preposition is applied after the verb has been restricted, then too may the multiple same prepositions be used.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444 footnote 3]
For example:

(@) [كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/25@]{.citex}  
    (The first [مِنْ]{.ar} restricts the governing verb [رُزِقُوا]{.ar} to [ٱلْجَنًّات]{.ar} "the gardens". And the second [مِنْ]{.ar} is restricted to "from the fruit from the gardens."^[@https://tafsir.app/kashaf/2/25@])

### The preposition preceding its governor

As a general tendency, a governor will typically precede its governee(s) in sentence word order.
This is rule is more strict for some governor-governee relationships than for others.
When governing the preposition (and also the adverbs of time and place (section\ ref)),
the order of the preposition and its governor is especially flexible.^[@radiy_kafiyah@ 1/289D--290A]
So a prepositional phrase may freely precede its governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444A]
This may be done for a number of purposes:

##### To limit and particularize the effect of the governor to the noun following the preposition.^[@maani_nahw@ 3/121] {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@) [وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2790@]{.citex}  
    "and from it originate the rivers of Paradise"

(@) [وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/3/122@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/121]{.citex}  
    "and upon Allāh the believers should rely."  

##### For drawing attention to the noun following the preposition^[@maani_nahw@ 3/121] {.unnumbered}

(@) [وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/3/180@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/123]{.citex}  
    "And Allāh, of what you do, is [fully] Aware."

(@) [أَلِهَـٰذَا جَمَعْتَنَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4770@]{.citex}  
    "Is it for _this_ (that) you have gathered us?"


### A meaningful connection between the preposition and its governor

In order for a preposition to be governed by a governor,
there needs to be a meaningful connection between the governor and the governed prepositional phrase.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/442D--445, @maani_nahw@ 3/131--133]

Consider the following example:

(@) [شَبَّهْتُ خَالِدًا وَهُوَ يَجُودُ بِمَالِهِ بِٱلْبَحْرِ]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 3/131]{.citex}  
    "I likened [#xAlid]{.trn2}, while he (was) being generous with his wealth, with the sea."  
    (The [و]{.ar} in [وَهُوَ يَجُودُ]{.ar} is translated as "while." See section\ (ref).)

In the above example,
the prepositional phrase
[بِٱلبَحْرِ]{.ar} "with the sea"
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar} "to liken,"
not with the verb 
[يَجُودُ]{.ar} "to be generous."
Therefore, it is
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[بِٱلبَحْرِ]{.ar},
not
[يَجُودُ]{.ar}.

Similarly,
the prepositional phrase
[بِمَالِهِ]{.ar} "with his wealth"
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[يَجُودُ]{.ar} "to be generous,"
not with the verb
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar} "to liken."
Therefore, it is
[يَجُودُ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[بِمَالِهِ]{.ar},
not
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar}.

Here is another example:

(@) [ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/5/3@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/131]{.citex}  
    "This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion;"

In the above example,
the prepositional phrase
[مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar} "of your religion
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[يَئِسَ]{.ar} "to despair,"
not with the verb 
[كَفَرَ]{.ar} "to disbelieve"
Therefore, it is
[يَئِسَ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar}
not
[كَفَرَ]{.ar}.^[@https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/5/3@]



In theory,
prepositions impart their own meanings.
And there is no restriction on using prepositions with any governor.
The only condition is that the meaning that the prepositional phrase brings to the sentence make sense with the meaning of the governor.

### The implication of general beingness

Consider the sentence:

(@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/211]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is in the house."

We mentioned in section\ (ref) above,
that the governor of a preposition must be a verb, or what has the effect of a verb.
But we find no such word in the sentence above.
So what then is the governor of the preposition [فِي]{.ar}?

In order to remain consistent with the Arabic grammatical model,
we _implicate_ the involvement of an implied governor.
This implied governor has the meaning given by the verb "is" or its verbal noun "being".
We will refer to it as _general beingness_.

In Arabic grammatical terminology,
general beingness is represented by the verb
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar}
or its ;ism_fail;
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar},
or by the word
[كَائِن]{.ar},
which is the ;ism_fail; of the verb
[كَانَ]{.ar}.

Using these representations of general beingness,
we can explicate
(one interpretation of)
example (@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar} as:

(@sentence-zayd-in-house-explicit) [زَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ] فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is [being] in the house."

The word "being" is not really needed in the translation because "is" provides the same meaning.
But we have added it to explicate the involvement of general beingness in the grammar of the sentence.

Note that
implicating general beingness in a sentence 
as we did in example (@sentence-zayd-in-house-explicit) above
is not same as if the words
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar} "to settle",
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar} "settled",
or
[كَائِن]{.ar} "being"
were actually expressed.
When expressed, they impart their own meaning.
For example

(@) [زَيْدٌ مُسْتَقِرٌّ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is settled in the house."

When implicating general beingness we only use the words
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar},
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar},
and
[كَائِن]{.ar}
terminologically.
In fact, according to the prevalent opinion among the grammarians,
general beingness can only be implied.^[@nahw_wafi@ 1/477]
If one of these (or any other) words is actually expressed,
then it will impart a specific meaning, not the meaning of general beingness.
Having said that, some grammarians did permit general beingness to be expressed.^[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/211 footnote]

### Implied general beingness as the ;xabar; of a sentence

The implication of generall beingness in the sentence
in example (@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
solves another problem for us.
Remember how we said that, in the Arabic grammatical model,
the preposition is a ;fadlah; element.
So if we remove it (and the following ;istate; noun [ٱلدَّار]{.ar}) from the sentence,
we should still be left with a complete sentence.
Let's try doing that:

(@) [زَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ]]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is [being]."

See how the implied general beingness serves as the ;3umdah; ;musnad;: the ;xabar;.
If we were to not implicate general beingness, we would be left with a grammatically incomplete sentence.

We also take this opportunity to explain an apparent inconsistency.
Back in chapter\ (ref),
we had said that a prepositional phrase can be the ;xabar; of a sentence.
We now state that, strictly speaking, it is the (implied) governor of the prepostion which is the ;xabar;.
But because the actual ;xabar; is implied and is not expressed, we can say, loosely speaking,
that the prepositional phrase is the ;xabar;.

This approach of applying a terminological label differently when loosely speaking vs when strictly speaking is common.^[@nahw_wafi@ 1/215, 2/118, 2/442]
We will see other examples of it in sections\ (refs) ;ia;.

### Other implied governors besides general beingness

While general beingness is necessarily implied and never expressed (see section\ (ref) above),
other governors of prepositions too may be optionally suppressed.
This is done on the condition that that the overall meaning or context supplies the meaning of the suppressed governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/447 footnote]
For example:

(@) [ٱلْحُرُّ بٱلْحُرِّ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/178@ cited by @nahw_wafi@ 2/447]{.citex}  
    "the free for the free"

In the above example,
the ;xabar; has been analyzed as the implied governor
[يَقْتَصُّ]{.ar} "is retributed against"
or
[يُقْتَلُ]{.ar} "is killed".
So the sentence with the implicated meaning is 
[الحُرُّ يَقْتَصُّ أوْ يُقْتَلُ بِالحُرِّ]{.ar}
"the free is retributed against, or killed, for the free."^[@https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/2/178@]

### The prepositional phrase as a ;na3t;

Consider the sentence

(@sentence-prep-phrase-na3t) [رأيتُ طائرًا على الغصن]{.ar}
    [@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]{.citex}  
    "I saw a bird on the branch."

Now the logical assumption is that the bird was on the branch, not that my act of seeing was done on a branch.
So this means that the preposition [فِي]{.ar} is not meaningfully connected with the verb [رَأَىٰ]{.ar}.
Therefore, [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} is not the governor of the preposition [فِي]{.ar}.^[@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]
So what then is governing the preposition [فِي]{.ar}.

Here again, we implicate the governor of general beingness, as if to say:

(@) [رأيتُ طائرًا [مُسْتَقِرًّا] على الغصن]{.ar}  
    "I saw a bird [being] on the branch."

General beingness
[[مُسْتَقِرًّا]]{.ar}
is implicated as the governor of
the preposition [فِي]{.ar}.
The implicated general beingness is also a ;na3t; to the ;mafulb; 
[طَائِرًا]{.ar}.
But because 
the implied general beingness is not expressed, we may say, loosely speaking,
that the prepositional phrase is the ;na3t;.

In order for a prepositional phrase to be a ;na3t;,
its ;manut; will usually be an indefinite noun,
like 
[طَائِرًا]{.ar}
is in example (@sentence-prep-phrase-na3t) above.
In the case where the prepositional phrase occurs after a definite noun,
(like in [رأيتُ ٱلطائر على الغصن]{.ar})
it will typically be analyzed as a ;hal;.
We will discuss this in more detail in chapter\ (ref) section\ (ref) ;ia;.

Here are some more examples of prepositional phrases as ;na3t;s:

<!--

    "There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves."  
    ([مِنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;^[])
-->

(@) [كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ]{.ar}

    ([بِرَبْوَةٍ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/2/265@])

    [@https://quran.com/2/129@]{.citex}  
    "Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves"  
    ([مِنْهُمْ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/2/129@])

    [@https://quran.com/43/31@]{.citex}  
    And they said, "Why was this Qur’ān not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?"

When a prepositional phrase is, loosely speaking, a ;na3t;,
its governor is typically the implicated general beingness.^[@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 2/285, @ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/213].
In fact, some grammarians insist that the implied governor can only be general beingness.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/3/194@ ([مَا وَعَدْتَنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ]{.ar})]
However, it is conceivable that the implied governor of the preposition be some other verb (or verbal noun).^[For example, [رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ]{.ar} is explained as [كفراً مضموما إلى كفرهم]{.ar} in @https://tafsir.app/kashaf/9/125@.]

<!--
### The order of different ;na3t;s

When a ;manut; is described by more than one ;na3t; and 
@nahw_wafi@ 3/496
-->

### The prepositional phrase in other functions

Besides the ;xabar; and the ;na3t; a prepositional phrase may also occur as a ;hal; and a ;silah;.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/441--442]
We will cover these two remaining topics in their respective chapters in sections\ (ref) and (ref) respectively.

## The government of the ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;

As we know, the ;mudafil; of an ;idaafah; is always in the ;istate;.
For example, in the annexation
[كِتَابُ ٱلْغُلَامِ]{.ar},
the ;mudafil;
[ٱلْغُلَامِ]{.ar}
is in the ;istate;.

There is some dispute with regard to what element governs the ;mudafil;.
The obvious contender is the ;mudaf;, ([كِتَاب]{.ar}) since apparently it _causes_ the ;mudafil; to be in the ;istate;.
However, some grammarians disliked the idea of a noun being a governor and so they have provided altenate theories.^[@owens_foundations_grammar@ §9.2.2.2.5 242--243]
But for our purposes, we can ignore those theories and consider the ;mudaf; to govern the ;mudafil;.

ولَمّا سَألُوا المَثُوبَةَ في الدُّنْيا والآخِرَةِ تَرَقَّوْا في السُّؤالِ إلى طَلَبِ تَحْقِيقِ المَثُوبَةِ، فَقالُوا ﴿وآتِنا ما وعَدْتَنا عَلى رُسُلِكَ﴾ .
وتَحْتَمِلُ كَلِمَةُ (عَلى) أنْ تَكُونَ لِتَعْدِيَةِ فِعْلِ الوَعْدِ، ومَعْناها التَّعْلِيلُ فَيَكُونُ الرُّسُلُ هُمُ المَوْعُودُ عَلَيْهِمْ، ومَعْنى الوَعْدِ عَلى الرُّسُلِ أنَّهُ وعْدٌ عَلى تَصْدِيقِهِمْ فَتَعَيَّنَ تَقْدِيرُ مُضافٍ، وتَحْتَمِلُ أنْ تَكُونَ (عَلى) ظَرْفًا مُسْتَقِرًّا، أيْ وعْدًا كائِنًا عَلى رُسُلِكَ أيْ، مُنَزَّلًا عَلَيْهِمْ، ومُتَعَلِّقُ الجارِّ في مِثْلِهِ كَوْنٌ غَيْرُ عامٍّ بَلْ هو كَوْنٌ خاصٌّ، ولا ضَيْرَ في ذَلِكَ إذا قامَتِ القَرِينَةُ، ومَعْنى (عَلى) حِينَئِذٍ الِاسْتِعْلاءُ المَجازِيُّ، أوْ تُجْعَلُ (عَلى) ظَرْفًا مُسْتَقِرًّا حالًا مِن ﴿ما وعَدْتَنا﴾ أيْضًا، بِتَقْدِيرِ كَوْنٍ عامٍّ لَكِنْ مَعَ تَقْدِيرِ مُضافٍ إلى رُسُلِكَ، أيْ عَلى ألْسِنَةِ رُسُلِكَ.

Abu Hayyan cites al-Zamakhshari who allows [على رسلك]{.ar} to be governed by a deleted محمول or منزل.
But Abu Hayyan does not like this permissibility because according to him the deleted 3aamil can only be general beingness.

Ibn 3aashoor, however, has no problem with it:

وقَوْلُهُ: ﴿عَلى رُسُلِكَ﴾ هو عَلى حَذْفِ مُضافٍ، فَقَدَّرَهُ الطَّبَرِيُّ وابْنُ عَطِيَّةَ: عَلى ألْسِنَةِ رُسُلِكَ. وقَدَّرَهُ الزَّمَخْشَرِيُّ: عَلى تَصْدِيقِ رُسُلِكَ. قالَ: فَـ(عَلى) هَذِهِ صِلَةٌ لِلْوَعْدِ في قَوْلِكَ: وعَدَ اللَّهُ الجَنَّةَ عَلى الطّاعَةِ. والمَعْنى: ما وعَدْتَنا عَلى تَصْدِيقِ رُسُلِكَ. ألا تَراهُ كَيْفَ أتْبَعَ ذِكْرَ المُنادِي لِلْإيمانِ وهو الرَّسُولُ، وقَوْلُهُ: (آمَنّا) وهو التَّصْدِيقُ. ويَجُوزُ أنْ يَكُونَ مُتَعَلِّقًا بِمَحْذُوفٍ، أيْ: ما وعَدْتَنا مُنْزِلًا عَلى رُسُلِكَ، أوْ مَحْمُولًا عَلى رُسُلِكَ؛ لِأنَّ الرُّسُلَ يَحْمِلُونَ ذَلِكَ، فَإنَّما عَلَيْهِ ما حُمِّلَ. انْتَهى. وهَذا الوَجْهُ الَّذِي ذَكَرَ آخِرًا أنَّهُ يَجُوزُ لَيْسَ بِجائِزٍ؛ لِأنَّ مِن قَواعِدِ النَّحْوِيِّينَ أنَّ الجارَّ والمَجْرُورَ والظَّرْفَ مَتى كانَ العامِلُ فِيهِما مُقَيَّدًا، فَلا بُدَّ مِن ذِكْرِ ذَلِكَ العامِلِ، ولا يَجُوزُ حَذْفُهُ، ولا يُحْذَفُ العامِلُ إلّا إذا كانَ كَوْنًا مُطْلَقًا. مِثالُ ذَلِكَ: زَيْدٌ ضاحِكٌ في الدّارِ، لا يَجُوزُ حَذْفُ ضاحِكٌ ألْبَتَّةَ. وإذا قُلْتَ: زِيدٌ في الدّارِ فالعامِلُ كَوْنٌ مُطْلَقٌ يُحْذَفُ. وكَذَلِكَ: زِيدٌ ناجٍ مِن بَنِي تَمِيمٍ، لا يَجُوزُ حَذْفُ ناجٍ. ولَوْ قُلْتَ: زِيدٌ مِن بَنِي تَمِيمٍ؛ جازَ عَلى تَقْدِيرِ: كائِنٌ مِن بَنِي تَمِيمٍ، والمَحْذُوفُ فِيما جَوَّزَهُ الزَّمَخْشَرِيُّ، وهو قَوْلُهُ: مُنْزَلًا أوْ مَحْمُولًا، لا يَجُوزُ حَذْفُهُ عَلى ما تَقَرَّرَ في عِلْمِ النَّحْوِ.
