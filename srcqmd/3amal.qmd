## Basic components of the sentence

There are two types of sentences in Arabic:

 i. The ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence.
    It begins with a noun.
    For example:

    (@) [زَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd is a man."

    (@) [زَيْدٌ كَتَبَ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd, he wrote."

ii. The verbal sentence.
    It begins with a verb.
    For example:

    (@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
        "Zayd wrote."

Particles like [وَ]{.ar} "and", [مَا]{.ar} are allowed to precede the sentences
(if applicable)
without affecting their being a
;mubtada;-;xabar;
or verbal sentence.
So [وَزَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ]{.ar} is still a 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
sentence.
And 
[مَا كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar} "Zayd did not write" is a verbal sentence.

The Arabic sentence,
(whether a
;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence,
or a verbal sentence)
has two basic components:

 i. The _;musnadi;_
ii. The _;musnad;_

The _;musnadi;_
and
the _;musnad;_
complement each other.
The ;musnadi; provides support to the ;musnad;.
And the ;musnad; relies upon the ;musnadi;.

In the 
;mubtada;-;xabar;
the ;mubtada; is the ;musnadi;.
And the ;xabar; is the ;musnad;.

And in the verbal sentence,
the ;faa3il; is the ;musnadi;.
And the verb is the ;musnad;.

The _;musnadi;_
and
the _;musnad;_
are the two _;3umdah;_ components of a sentence, without which the sentence is not complete.
Any other components that are added are considered _;fadlah;_.

Consider the following example:

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ كِتَابًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote a book."

In the above example, the ;mafulb; [كِتًابًا]{.ar} is considered a ;fadlah; component.
If we remove it from the sentence, the sentence remains grammatically complete.

(@) [كَتَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd wrote."

By the way,
a ;fadlah; component 
is not necessary to make a sentence grammatically complete.
But it may affect the meaning drastically.

Consider the following example:

(@) [مَا رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا]{.ar}  
    "I did not see Zayd."

If we remove the ;mafulb; [زَيْدًا]{.ar}, the sentence is grammatically complete but will have a very different meaning from the original:

(@) [مَا رَأَيْتُ]{.ar}  
    "I did not see."

Some fact.^[@liheibi_sentence@ 245]

Sometimes the ;3aamil; is required to be implicit.
For example:

(@) [عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ]{.ar}  
    "on a great existing^from\ the\ two\ cities^ man"

The fundamental structure is "on a great existing man,"
where "great" and "existing" are the ;na3t;s.
Then the ;shibh_jumlah; 
[مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
is added as a ;ma3mul; of the conceptual ;3aamil; "existing."
