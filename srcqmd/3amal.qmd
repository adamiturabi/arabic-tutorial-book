# Sentence and government theory

Some fact.^[@liheibi_sentence@ 245]

Sometimes the ;3aamil; is required to be implicit.
For example:

(@) [عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ]{.ar}  
    "on a great existing^from\ the\ two\ cities^ man"

The fundamental structure is "on a great existing man,"
where "great" and "existing" are the ;na3t;s.
Then the ;shibh_jumlah; 
[مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ]{.ar}
is added as a ;ma3mul; of the conceptual ;3aamil; "existing."
