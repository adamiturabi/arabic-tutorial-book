# The Arabic grammatical tradition

## History of the Arabic grammatical tradition

The exact details of the genesis of the Arabic grammatical tradition
are shrouded in the mists of history.
What we can say, summarily, is that
during the time of the revelation of the ;quran;,
the Arabs spoke Classical Arabic natively.
Then, after the time of the revelation,
when the caliphate extended beyond the Arabian peninsula,
an Arabic began to be spoken,
by the newer generation and non-native speakers,
that was diverging from Classical Arabic.

Around this time (c.\ 50\ ;ah;)


## Rule building

Consider the following scenario where
we want to teach a student Arabic.
Here is one approach:

We first teach the student the sentence:

(@) [أُرِيدُ أَنْ آكُلَ طَعَامًا]{.ar}
    [I want to eat some food.]{.trans}

We have the student memorize this sentence and its meaning.

And then we teach him the sentence:

(@) [أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشْرَبَ مَاءً]{.ar}
    [I want to drink some water.]{.trans}

We again
have the student memorize this sentence and its meaning.

Similarly, we list all the sentences we can think of, and have him memorize them verbatim along with their meanings.

At some point, we may realize that instead of teaching all possible sentences and their meanings,
maybe we can start with some sentences.
break the sentences into words, classify the words into categories
(nouns, verbs, etc.),
and give him the rules for connecting the words together to form sentences.
Clearly, this is more efficient than listing all possible sentences,
and memorizing each one and its meaning individually.



## The underlying levels of speech

The grammarians,
thus started with a body of authentic Arabic speech.
They broke down that speech into sentences and words,
classified the words into different grammatical categories,
and extracted the rules for connecting the words to form sentences.
This formed the basis of the science of grammar.

But actually, the grammarians went one step further.
They noticed that some sentences can superficially be different,
but they have a common behavior which can be attributed to the same cause.
For example,
let's look at the sentences:

(@) [جلست لأن أستريح]{.ar}
    [nawh waadih 1/135]{.citex}

(@) [جلست لأستريح]{.ar}
    [nawh waadih 1/135]{.citex}

In examples () and () above, we note that the verb
[أستريح]{.ar}
is in the ;astate;.
In example (),
the verb is preceded by [لِأَنْ]{.ar}
whereas in example ()
the verb is preceded only by [لِ]{.ar}.

Now, we know that a ;mudarie; verb is put in the ;astate; 
when it directly follows [أَنْ]{.ar}.
For example:

(@) [يسرني أن تزورَنا]{.ar}

Putting these (and other) factors together,
the grammarians theorize that
when an ;astate; ;mudarie; verb follows [لِ]{.ar}
(as in example ()) above),
then an implied [أَنْ]{.ar} is assumed after the [لِ]{.ar}.
And it is this implied
[أَنْ]{.ar} that causes the verb to be in ;astate;.

So, according to the grammarians,
when we hear the utterance
[جلست لأستريح]{.ar},
then there is an underlying form:
[جلست لأن أستريح]{.ar}
and this underlying form explains the syntax of the words in the speech that was actually uttered.
In this case, an
implied [أَنْ]{.ar} 
in the underlying form
caused the verb [أستريح] to be in ;astate;.

Similarly, sentences can superficially be similar,
but they have different underlying causes for what appears to be a similarity in their superficial form.
For example,
consider the sentences:

(@) [جئت راكبا]{.ar}
    [kees 286 citing ibn jinni]{.citex}  
    [I came  riding.]{.trans}  

(@) [طبت به نفسا]{.ar}
    [kees 286 citing ibn jinni]{.citex}  
    [I [felt] good towards him in mind.]{.trans}  

(@) [جئت راكبا]{.ar}
    [kees 286 citing ibn jinni]{.citex}  
    [I came  riding.]{.trans}  

(@) [طبت به نفسا]{.ar}
    [kees 286 citing ibn jinni]{.citex}  
    [I [felt] good towards him in mind.]{.trans}  

Superficially both nouns
[راكبا]{.ar}
and
[نفسا]{.ar}
are in the ;astate; and they both describe the verbs in the sentence.
So they are both adverbs.
But example () can have an underlying form which is reconstructed as:

(@) [طابت به نفسي]{.ar}
    [My mind [felt] good towards him]{.trans}  

In the reconstructed underlying form above, [نفس]{.ar} becomes the ;faa3il; of the verb.
Example () does not support a similar reconstructed underlying form.
That is,
we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [جَاء رَاكِبي]{.ar}  
    [My riding came]{.trans}

This tells us that
[راكبا]{.ar}
and
[نفسا]{.ar}
fall in different grammatical categories.
[راكبا]{.ar}
is a ;hal;,
whereas
[نفسا]{.ar}
is a ;tamyiz;.


The grammarians contended that the native speaker knows that the two sentences fall under the same grammatical category, and so he deals with them in a similar way.
So postulated a underlying form in which the similarity of both sentences becomes apparent.
In the case of the above example,
the underlying form is

In a similar manner, some sentences can appear to be similar in form of their utterance,
but actually are somewhat different at an underlying level.
And so there should actually

And so there is a hierarchy and levels of similarity and differences in the mind of the native speaker,
which necessitate coming up with a grammatical framework that mirrors this systemization in the mind of the speaker.

Arabic grammar then is
a grammarian-constructed model of the speech unit in the mind of the native Classical Arabic speaker.

Kees 286:

> The crucial point is that the underlying form is needed for the explanation of the syntactic relations in the surface sentence.


Native speaker's knowledge is unconscious.
Grammarian comes up with causes in the mind of the native speaker.

Quote by al-xaleel

##

Doesn't necessarily match, and often will not match,
with actual utterance

zaydan darabtuhu
[darabtu] zaydan darabtuhu

##

underlying form aims to be minimalist.^[kees 284 citing guilliame]

an mudmarah wujooban

hatta + marfoo3 = no an

an + mudaari3 = masdar

Sometimes underlying form, as costructed by the grammarians, does not explain authentic usage.

##

Underlying form is only a model.
Underlying form is unheard.
subjective.
subject to critique.
weaker than a grammarian's proof
Some grammarians were more reactionary. and rejected popular models.

## taqdir is not diachronic

kees 283--284

## underlying form can have different levels

zaydan darabtu

upper level: ma3mool preceded 3aamil

lower level: [darabtu] zaydan darabtu
because 3aamil has to precede ma3mool

## Outline


Ultimate authority is the speech of the Arabs

Rules are deduced from analyzing corpus.

Rules are formulated in order:

* explain grammar analytically
* for qiyaas

Language is very complex.

Rules can keep on refining but

Rules can reach a limit where they are not suffient to capture the complexity.

Nevertheless, rules are useful not least to explain the normative usage

Within the grammatical tradition,
some grammarians were more practical.

as a school, their rep are the kufans,

they are strong on going back to ultimate authority: speech of arabs

but weak on coming up with a harmonious framework.

Basrans are more theoretical.

They are strong on coming up with harmonious model.

But you can't put cart before horse, when using their rules.

When we find authentic usage to be contrary to rules,
then either or both:

1. Rule is not sufficiently refined, and perhaps can never be.
2. It can be an anomalous usage that is correct but not normative.

Grammarians came up with 3ilal.

They may not be historically accurate.

They are only to provide a path to lead to a harmonious grammatical model.

[أضعف من حجة نحوي]{.ar}

## theory of taqdeer

kay has an mudmar

define rule an + subj = masdar

so now an is implicated when it is not there

## How to understand the grammarians' examples

Examples which they use,
especially contrived ones,
are to be understood within the scope of the discussion.
For example, the grammarians may say that the following is not a correct sentence:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرا أمس]{.ar}

What they mean is that the ;ism_fail; cannot govern a ;mafulb; with a perfective meaning.
They use [أمس]{.ar} to show that the action occurred in the past and thus that the action was perfect.
But actually, the same sentence can be used if the ;ism_fail; has a past continuous meaning.
So we have to understand that when they use an example,
it may not necessarily be the wording of the example which is correct or incorrect.
They are using the example as a representation of
the concept which they are trying to explain.
In the scope of another concept, the same example may have a different ruling wrt to its correctness.

Continuing with the above example,
the grammarians will say that because the ;ism_fail; cannot have a ;mafulb;
therefore it has to be a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
And they give the following example:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرو أمس]{.ar}

They again use [أمس]{.ar} to indicate the past.
But [أمس]{.ar}, as a ;dharf_zaman; needs a governor.
The ;ism_fail; can't govern it because it is not a governor.
The grammarians won't explainn this in the context of the governance of the ;ism_fail; because it is outside the scope of the current discussion.
Actually,
a verb is implicated, thus:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرو [ضربه] أمس]{.ar}

Contrived examples are simplistic and not bulletproof outside of the concept which is being discussed.


## use of [HadIv]{.trn2} as a corpus

most grammarians did not consider authoritative because of narrators in chain who narrated by meaning and not necessarily wording.

[فيصل المنصور]{.ar} [cites works of [ياسر الطريقي]{.ar}](https://archive.org/details/riga2/page/n477/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1)

* [الشواهد الحديثية في الأبواب النحوية]{.ar}
* [الاستشهاد بالحديث في المسائل النحوية]{.ar}

We will use hadith in this book because easier for student to read than poetry.
And more practical.
But just to be safe, any deduction that you find us doing purely from hadith, without being backed by an authority should be taken with a grain of salt, until and unless you are able to substantiate it.

## Conclusion

The theory of government 
is a theory on which much of the Arabic grammatical tradition rests.
But it is worth reiterating that it is a theory which was built and refined to explain the motives behind the speech of the Arabs.
The ultimate authority in the Arabic language is the speech of the Arabs.
And it is a problem of any
grammatical theory that it has to fit the speech of the Arabs and not vice versa.

Frequently we will find rules that say:
X can not govern Y in Z circumstance.
And then we find usage which may seem to contradict this rule.
Underlying form is implicated to conform to rule.
Or theory needs to be modified.
