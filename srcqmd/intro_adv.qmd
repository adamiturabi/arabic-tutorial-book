# The Arabic grammatical tradition



Ultimate authority is the speech of the Arabs

Rules are deduced from analyzing corpus.

Rules are formulated in order:

* explain grammar analytically
* for qiyaas

Language is very complex.

Rules can keep on refining but

Rules can reach a limit where they are not suffient to capture the complexity.

Nevertheless, rules are useful not least to explain the normative usage

Within the grammatical tradition,
some grammarians were more practical.

as a school, their rep are the kufans,

they are strong on going back to ultimate authority: speech of arabs

but weak on coming up with a harmonious framework.

Basrans are more theoretical.

They are strong on coming up with harmonious model.

But you can't put cart before horse, when using their rules.

When we find authentic usage to be contrary to rules,
then either or both:

1. Rule is not sufficiently refined, and perhaps can never be.
2. It can be an anomalous usage that is correct but not normative.

Grammarians came up with 3ilal.

They may not be historically accurate.

They are only to provide a path to lead to a harmonious grammatical model.

## theory of taqdeer

kay has an mudmar

define rule an + subj = masdar

so now an is implicated when it is not there

## How to understand the grammarians' examples

Examples which they use,
especially contrived ones,
are to be understood within the scope of the discussion.
For example, the grammarians may say that the following is not a correct sentence:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرا أمس]{.ar}

What they mean is that the ;ism_fail; cannot govern a ;mafulb; with a perfective meaning.
They use [أمس]{.ar} to show that the action occurred in the past and thus that the action was perfect.
But actually, the same sentence can be used if the ;ism_fail; has a past continuous meaning.
So we have to understand that when they use an example,
it may not necessarily be the wording of the example which is correct or incorrect.
They are using the example as a representation of
the concept which they are trying to explain.
In the scope of another concept, the same example may have a different ruling wrt to its correctness.

Continuing with the above example,
the grammarians will say that because the ;ism_fail; cannot have a ;mafulb;
therefore it has to be a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.
And they give the following example:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرو أمس]{.ar}

They again use [أمس]{.ar} to indicate the past.
But [أمس]{.ar}, as a ;dharf_zaman; needs a governor.
The ;ism_fail; can't govern it because it is not a governor.
The grammarians won't explainn this in the context of the governance of the ;ism_fail; because it is outside the scope of the current discussion.
Actually,
a verb is implicated, thus:

(@) [زيد ضارب عمرو [ضربه] أمس]{.ar}

Contrived examples are simplistic and not bulletproof outside of the concept which is being discussed.


## use of [HadIv]{.trn2} as a corpus

most grammarians did not consider authoritative because of narrators in chain who narrated by meaning and not necessarily wording.

[فيصل المنصور]{.ar} [cites works of [ياسر الطريقي]{.ar}](https://archive.org/details/riga2/page/n477/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1)

* [الشواهد الحديثية في الأبواب النحوية]{.ar}
* [الاستشهاد بالحديث في المسائل النحوية]{.ar}

We will use hadith in this book because easier for student to read than poetry.
And more practical.
But just to be safe, any deduction that you find us doing purely from hadith, without being backed by an authority should be taken with a grain of salt, until and unless you are able to substantiate it.
