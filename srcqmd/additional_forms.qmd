# Additional forms of the verb

## Introduction

So far we have been studying the form 1 verb ([فَعَلَ يَفُعَلُ]{.ar}).
The form 1 verb is the basic form of the verb.
It consists of only the three root letters for the stateless verb.

In this chapter we will learn additional forms of the verb.
These forms add extra letters to three root letters.
There are about 15 or so additional forms of the verb.
But only 10 or so are in common usage.

Learning these additional forms may seem tedious but we advise you to persevere
because additional forms of the verb are used very commonly.

The form 1 verb has variability in the middle ([ع]{.ar}) letter, which can have either an [a]{.trn}, [i]{.trn}, or [u]{.trn} mark.
It also has variability in the pattern its verbal noun of doing.
The additional forms have almost no variability of this kind.
So, in one sense, the additional forms of the verb are easier than the form 1 verb.

## The form 2 verb [فَعَّلَ يُفَعِّلُ]{.ar}

The form 2 verb doubles the middle [ع]{.ar} letter.
The vowel mark on the middle letter does not vary.
Here are some examples of form 2 verbs:

| Root | Verb | Meaning |
|:--|:----|:-------|
|[علم]{.ar}|[عَلَّمَ يُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}| to teach |
|[قتل]{.ar}|[قَتَّلَ يُقَتِّلُ]{.ar}| to massacre |
|[كبر]{.ar}|[كَبَّرَ يُكَبِّرُ]{.ar}| to magnify, say [ٱَللَّـٰهُ أَكْبَرُ]{.ar} |
