# Significance of the ;mushtaqq; nouns

## Introduction

The ;mushtaqq; nouns,
like the ;ism_fail; and the ;sifah_mush;,
are technically nouns.
But because of their derivation,
and close association with the verbs,
they can have some verbal qualities.
We have already seen how, like verbs,
they can govern a ;faa3il; and a ;mafulb;
(in the case of the ;sifah_mush;: a ;mafulb;-like governee).

In this chapter,
we will study the meanings that these ;mushtaqq; nouns can signify,
especially when they behave as verb-like governors.

## The essential significance of the ;ism_fail;

The ;ism_fail; is derived from a verb.
For example,
the ;ism_fail;
[منطلق]{.ar}
is derived from the verb
[انطلق ينطلق]{.ar}
[to set out]{.trans}.
The essential significance of the ;ism_fail; is
that its referent can be described as the doer of the action of its verb.
Consider the example:

(@ma3aami_mush_zaydun_muntaliqun) [زيد منطلق]{.ar}
    [@za3balawi_dirasat@ 486 citing [الجرجاني]{.ar}]{.citex}
    [Zayd is a setter out.]{.trans}

In example () above
[منطلق]{.ar}
essentially signifies that its referent
[زيد]{.ar}
can be described as one who sets out.
As opposed to the ;ism_fail;,
the essential significance of the ;mudarie; verb is the dynamic execution of the action of the verb.
For example:

(@ma3aami_mush_zaydun_yantaliqu) [زيد ينطلق]{.ar}
    [@za3balawi_dirasat@ 486 citing [الجرجاني]{.ar}]{.citex}
    [Zayd is setting out.]{.trans}  
    or [Zayd sets out.]{.trans}  
    or [Zayd will set out.]{.trans} 

In example () above,
the ;mudarie; verb
[ينطلق]{.ar} indicates the dynamic action of setting out.

Here is another example of a ;ism_fail; used to signify the doer of a verb.
This time the ;ism_fail; is from a transitive noun and has a ;mafulb;.

(@ism_fail_nasai_3498) [وَأَنَا **مُتَّبِعٌ** فِي ذَلِكَ قَضَاءَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي مَرْيَمَ الْمَغَالِيَّةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:3498@]{.citex}  
    [I am **a follower**, in that [matter], **of** the ruling of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} ;pbuh; concerning Maryam al-[#magAliyyah]{.trn2}.]{.trans}

The difference between the essential significance of the ;ism_fail;
and the essential significance of the verb is highlighted in 
 [سورة الكافرون]{.ar}:

::: {.quran}
قُلۡ یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلۡكَـٰفِرُونَ۝
لَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ مَا تَعۡبُدُونَ۝

[@https://quran.com/109@]{.citex}  
_Say, "O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion."_

[#ibn al-#qayyim]{.trn2} says,
in the [tafsIr]{.trn2} of this ;surah;:

> Negation isn't employed for [the disbelievers] except by the ;ism_fail;. And for [the Prophet ;pbuh;], [negation] is employed once using the verb, and once using the ;ism_fail;
>
> And this is -- and [#allAh]{.trn2} knows best -- due to a marvelous wisdom, which is that the greater objective is [the Prophet's ;pbuh;] disassociation from their gods from every perspective and in every [instance of] time.
> So [the Prophet ;pbuh;, in speaking to the disbelievers with the words of the revealed ;surah;], used first the verb [[أَعْبُدُ]{.ar}],
> which signifies dynamic occurrence,
> and then used for this same negation the ;ism_fail; [[عَابِد]{.ar}] in the second instance,
> i.e. "This [worshipping of what you worship] is not my description nor my state of affairs."
> [This is] as if he had said: "Worshipping other than [#allAh]{.trn2} will not be an verbal action of mine, nor a descrption of mine."
> Thus he used two negations for two negated items [a verbal action, and a description], that are intended by the negation.
>
> As for [the negation used for the disbelievers], he used only the ;ism_fail; [عَابِدُونَ]{.ar},
> which signifies the description [of its referent by the ;ism_fail;] and the stability [of this description],
> i.e. "The stable, requisite, description [of being a worshipper] of [#allah]{.trn2} is negated from you.
> For this description cannot be established for you.
> It is only established for the one who singles out [#allAh]{.trn2} exclusively for worship,
> and then does not associate anyone with Him.
> But you, because you have worshipped other than Him, are not from His worshippers."
> Even if they may have worshipped [#allAh]{.trn2} some of the time.
> For the polytheist worships [#allAh]{.trn2} and worships, with Him, others besides Him.
> Just like the People of the Cave said:
> [And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than Allāh]{.trans} [@https://quran.com/18/16@]{.citex}
> i.e., "you have withdrawn from their gods, except [#allAh]{.trn2}, for you have not withdrawn from Him."
> And similarly did the polytheists say regarding their gods:
> ["We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allāh in position."]{.trans} [@https://quran.com/39/3@]{.citex}.
> Thus they used to worship, with Him, others besides Him.
> So the verb [[عَبَدَ يَعْبُدُ]{.ar}] is not negated from them because of its occurrence from them.
> But the description [[عَابِد]{.ar}] is negated because whoever worshipped other than [#allAh]{.trn2}
> is not established on the worship of [#allAh]{.trn2}, and is not described by [being a worshipper of [#allAh]{.trn2}].^[@https://tafsir.app/ibn-alqayyim/109/6@]




The ;ism_fail;
can be used in place of a verb.
So (@ma3aami_mush_zaydun_muntaliqun) [زيد منطلق]{.ar} can be used 
instead of (@ma3aami_mush_zaydun_yantaliqu) [زيد ينطلق]{.ar}
to mean
[Zayd is setting out]{.trans}, or
[Zayd sets out]{.trans}, or
[Zayd will sets out]{.trans}.
But it does this while (typically)
retaining its essential significance of describing its referent as the doer of a verb,
We will describe this usage of the ;ism_fail; in place of a verb in the next few sections, ;ia;.

## The ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} used to indicate a imperfect static state

One of the more common usages of the ;ism_fail; is to indicate that the ;faa3il; is in an imperfect static state.
The term _static state_ here means remaining in a stationary condition or position as opposed to a dynamic action.

<!--
The word "static" here signifies that the state of the ;faa3il; 
is steady and relatively unchanging.
-->

The ;ism_fail; indicates being in a state from a semantic aspect.
And we have already studied that the ;hal; syntactically indicates being in a state.
These two (semantic and syntactic) aspects of indicating being in a state are often combined.
So, we will see from the examples in this section that
the ;ism_fail; is often (but not always) either a ;hal;, or part of a ;hal; sentence.

As we discuss the state indicated by an ;ism_fail; we will often deal with _stative_ verbs.
_Stative_ verbs are those which mean to be in a state.
For example:
[جَلَسَ]{.ar} to sit,
[قَامَ]{.ar} to stand,
[نَامَ]{.ar} to sleep,
[لَبِسَ]{.ar} to wear,
etc.
These verbs often mean both: to do an action of entering into a state, and also to remain in such a state.
For example,
[جَلَسَ]{.ar} can mean both: to enter into a seated state (from another position like standing, etc.), and also to remain in a seated state.
Similarly,
[لَبِسَ]{.ar} can mean both: to put on a garment, and also to be in a state of having put on the garment.

In contrast to the ;ism_fail;, the ;mudarie; verb indicates that the doer is doing a dynamic action.
Consider the following example:

(@) [كُنْتُ مُسَافِرًا فَأَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ **يَأْكُلُ** وَأَنَا **صَائِمٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:2281@]{.citex}  
    "I was traveling and I came to the Prophet while he was **eating** and I was **fasting**."

The verb [يَأْكُلُ]{.ar} indicates a dynamic activity, where the ;faa3il; is actively eating.
Whereas the ;ism_fail; [صَائِم]{.ar} calls attention to the ;faa3il;'s being in a (static) state of fasting, and not to his actively doing the activity of fasting.

Even when a verb that is associated with a dynamic activity,
its ;ism_fail; can be used instead of the verb when the 
purpose is to indicate the ;faa3il;'s _being in a state_ of doing the activity,
rather than to indicate the dynamic activity of the verb.
For example:

(@) [فَلَبِثَ الْأَوْسُ وَالْخَزْرَجُ **مُتَحَارِبِينَ** عِشْرِينَ سَنَةً فِي أَمْرِ سُمَيْرٍ]{.ar}
    [marmor 134]{.citex}  
    "So [al-E#aws]{.trn2} and [al-#xazraj]{.trn2} stayed **(in a state of) fighting each other** for twenty years because of the matter of Sumayr."

(@) [فَمَا الَّذِي أَنْتَ فِيهِ الْآنَ **مُجْمِعٌ**]{.ar}
    [marmor 99A]{.citex}  
    "So what is it that you are now (in a state of being) **decided** about?

Here are some more examples of the the ;ism_fail; being used to indicate being in a static state:

(@) [لَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمَ أُحُدٍ انْهَزَمَ النَّاسُ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَأَبُو طَلْحَةَ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم **مُجَوِّبٌ** عَلَيْهِ بِحَجَفَةٍ لَهُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4064@]{.citex}  
    "When it was the day of [#uHud]{.trn2}, the people left the Prophet ;pbuh; while [#abU #TalHah]{.trn2} was in front of the Prophet ;pbuh;, **shielding** him with a leather shield of his."

(@) [فَخَرَجَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ **مُشْتَمِلٌ** عَلَى شَيْءٍ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3769@]{.citex}  
    "So the Prophet ;pbuh; came out while he was **(in a state of) covering** something [with his garment]."

(@) [وَإِذَا هُوَ **مُعْتَمِدٌ** عَلَى عَصًا فِي صَلاَتِهِ فَقُلْنَا بَعْدَ أَنْ سَلَّمْنَا . فَقَالَ حَدَّثَتْنِي أُمُّ قَيْسٍ بِنْتُ مِحْصَنٍ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَمَّا أَسَنَّ وَحَمَلَ اللَّحْمَ اتَّخَذَ عَمُودًا فِي مُصَلاَّهُ **يَعْتَمِدُ** عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:948@]{.citex}  
    "And incidentally, he was **resting** on a staff in his prayer. We [asked] him (about resting on the staff) after we had given the salutation; He said: Umm Qays daughter of [#miHSan]{.trn2} said to me that when the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; became aged and the flesh grew increasingly on him, he took a prop at his place of prayer and he **would rest** on it."  
    (Note how the ;ism_fail; [مُعْتَمِد]{.ar} indicates a state and the ;mudarie; verb [يَعْتَمِدُ]{.ar} indicates the activity."

(@) [فَبَيْنَا أَنَا **نَازِلٌ** تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ إِذَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/malik/48/1@]{.citex}

    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari/56@]{.citex}  
    When a slave journeys or falls ill, a [similar reward] is written for him as what he used to do while **staying** (i.e. not journeying) [and] healthy.

    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5979@]{.citex}  
    My mother has arrived and she is desirous (of my favor).

### The ;mafulb; of the ;ism_fail; when indicating a static state

When the ;ism_fail; is dervied from a transitive verb,
then the ;ism_fail;,
when indicating a static state,
may take a ;mafulb;
(as long as it satisifes the conditions specified in section\ (ref)).
For example:

(@) [مَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ **مُلْتَمِسًا لَيْلَةَ** الْقَدْرِ فَلْيَلْتَمِسْهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ وِتْرًا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ahmad:298@]{.citex}  
    "Whoever amongst you is **seeking** the Night of Decree, then let him seek it in the last ten days of [#ramaDAn]{.trn2}, [in the] the odd [nights]."  
    (Note the the ;ism_fail; [مُلْتَمِسًا]{.ar} has a ;mafulb; [لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ]{.ar}.)

(@) [إِنَّهُ كَانَ يُصَلِّي وَهُوَ **مُسْبِلٌ إِزَارَهُ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:638@, graded weak by [al-E#albAni]{.trn2}]{.citex}  
    "Indeed he was praying while **trailing** his lower garment."

(@) [وَوَقَفْتُ عِنْدَ بَابِ عَائِشَةَ فَإِذَا هُوَ **مُسْتَقْبِلٌ الْمَغْرِبَ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/adab:451@]{.citex}  
    "And I stopped at the door of [#eAEicah]{.trn2} and incidentally, it was facing the west."

(@) [كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم **حَامِلَ الْحَسَنِ** بْنِ عَلِيٍّ عَلَى عَاتِقِهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3784@]{.citex}  
    "The Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; was carrying [al-#Hasan ibn #ealiyy]{.trn2} on his shoulder"  
    ([حَامِلَ الْحَسَنِ]{.ar} is a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.)

(@) [أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ يُصَلِّي وَهُوَ **حَامِلٌ أُمَامَةَ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:1204@]{.citex}  
    "that the Messenger of Allah used to pray while he [was] **carrying** [#umAmah]{.trn2}"

(@ism_fail_wearing_bedsheet) [أَنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ اسْتَأْذَنَ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ **لاَبِسٌ مِرْطَ** عَائِشَةَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2402a@]{.citex}  
    "that [#abU #bakr]{.trn2} sought permission from the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; [for entrance in his apartment] while he was lying on his bed having on him [#eAEicah]{.trn2}'s bed-sheet."

However, when the main intent is to indicate the state of the ;faa3il;
independent of the action of the ;faa3il; upon any ;maful;,
then the ;ism_fail; can occur without a ;mafulb;.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ عُثْمَانُ أَجَلْ وَلَكِنَّا كُنَّا **خَائِفِينَ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ahmad:431@]{.citex}  
    [#euvman]{.trn2} said, "Yes, but we were in a state of fear."

In such cases,
the ;ism_fail; can be followed with a verb (typically its own), specifying the ;mafulb;.
For example:

(@) [فَخَرَجْنَا **خَائِفِينَ** **نَخَافُ الرَّصَدَ**]{.ar}
    [maghazi 28 cited by @marmor_tense@ 138]{.citex}  
    "So we set out afraid, fearing ambush."


(@3amal_ism_fail_3aamilun_ya3mal) [وَرُزَيْقٌ **عَامِلٌ** عَلَى أَرْضٍ **يَعْمَلُهَا**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:893@]{.citex}  
    "Ruzayq was (in a state of) working on the land, working (i.e. farming) it."  

### The ;ism_fail; indicating a habitual state

The static state that is indicated by the ;ism_fail; often tends to be continuous rather than habitual.
But the ;ism_fail; can also indicate a habitual state.
For example:

(@) [عَنِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ أَنَّهُ قَالَ لَا يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مَنَّانٌ وَلَا **عَاقٌّ وَالِدَيْهِ** وَلَا مُدْمِنُ خَمْرٍ]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:6882]{.citex}  
    [It was narrated] from the Prophet ;pbuh; that he said: "One who reminds people (of what he has given them) will not enter Paradise, nor will **one who disobeys** his parents, nor one addicted to wine."

### The ;ism_fail; for verbs of posture

Verbs of posture inlude:
[جَلَسَ]{.ar} to sit,
[قَامَ]{.ar} to stand,
[اضْطَجَعَ]{.ar} to lie down,
etc.

With such verbs,
the ;mudarie; verb,
when used for the present or past,
tends to be used only for the habitual tense and not for the continuous tense.
So if we say
[يَجْلِسُ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
then it will usually mean _Zayd sits_ and not _Zayd is sitting_.

For the continuous tense,
only
the ;ism_fail; tends to be used.
So, in order to say _Zayd is sitting_ we will usually say
[زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ]{.ar}.

Here are some examples of the ;ism_fail; and ;mudarie; verb for verbs of posture:

Rarely, the ;mudarie; verb has been found to be used to indicate a continuous tense.
But in such cases it will likely be in a ;hal; or with an adverb which will help indicate its continuous, rather than habitual, significance.
Examples:

(@) [أَنَّهُ رَأَى رَجُلاً **يَتَّكِئُ** عَلَى يَدِهِ الْيُسْرَى]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:994@]{.citex}

#### Transitive verbs of posture {.unnumbered}

The verbs of posture are usually intransitive verbs,
as you can see in the examples so far.
But a transitive verb of posture can also be used.
For example:

#### Other verbs that have similar behavior to the verbs of posture {.unnumbered}

In addition to verbs of posture,
there are a few other verbs that indicate 
show the same distiction of the ;ism_fail; being used for the continous tense and the ;mudarie; verb for the habitual tense.
For example:
[نَامَ]{.ar} _to sleep_,
[صَامَ]{.ar} _to fast_.
The reason that these verbs show the same behavior as verbs of posture may be that the ;faa3il; is not actively _doing_ anything except remaining in a condition.
Here are some examples with these verbs:

(@) [ قُلْنَا لِعَمْرٍو إِنَّ نَاسًا يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم **تَنَامُ** عَيْنُهُ وَلاَ **يَنَامُ** قَلْبُهُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:859@]{.citex}  
    "We said to [#eamr]{.trn2}: 'Indeed some people say that the Prophet ;pbuh; his eye sleeps but his heart does not sleep.'"

(@) [جَاءَتْ مَلاَئِكَةٌ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهْوَ **نَائِمٌ** فَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّهُ **نَائِمٌ** وَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّ الْعَيْنَ **نَائِمَةٌ** وَالْقَلْبَ يَقْظَانُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7281@]{.citex}  
    Some angels came to the Prophet ;pbuh; while he was sleeping. Some of them said, "He is sleeping." Some [others] of them said, "His eye[s] are sleeping but his heart is awake."

(@) [إِنِّي رَجُلٌ **أَصُومُ** أَفَأَصُومُ فِي السَّفَرِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1121d@]{.citex}  
    "I am a man who [habitually] fasts, so should I fast in journeying?"

(@) [سِرْنَا مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ **صَائِمٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1101c@]{.citex}  
    We travelled with the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; while he [was] fasting.

### The ;ism_fail; for verbs of motion

The ;ism_fail; is very common with verbs of motion, like:
[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} to go,
[مَشَى]{.ar} to walk,
[رَجَعَ]{.ar} to return,
[سَارَ]{.ar} to travel,
etc.
The ;ism_fail; for these verbs again indicates the situation of being in a move rather than the actual dynamic movement.^[@marmor_tense@ 127]
For example:

(@) [وَذَلِكَ الْمَسْجِدُ عَلَى حَافَةِ الطَّرِيقِ الْيُمْنَى، وَأَنْتَ **ذَاهِبٌ** إِلَى مَكَّةَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:485@]{.citex}  
    And that mosque is on the right edge of the path as you are **going** to Makkah

(@) [كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَأْتِي قُبَاءً رَاكِبًا وَمَاشِيًا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1194@]{.citex}  
    The Prophet ;pbuh; used to come to [#qubAE]{.trn2} while riding and while walking.

(@) [لَحِقَنِي عَبَايَةُ بْنُ رَافِعٍ وَأَنَا مَاشٍ، إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116@]{.citex}  
    [#eabAyah ibn #rAfie]{.trn2} joined me while I was **walking** to the [jumueah]{.trn2}

(@) [كُنْتُ **مُسَافِرًا** فَأَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ يَأْكُلُ وَأَنَا صَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:2281@]{.citex}  
    "I was journeying and I came to the Prophet ;pbuh; while he was eating and I was fasting."

(@) [بَيْنَا النَّبِيُّ ﷺ سَائِرٌ إِلَى تَبُوكَ نَزَلَ عَنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/bayhaqi:16844]{.citex}  
    "While the Prophet ;pbuh; was **travelling** to [#tabUk]{.trn2}, he dismounted off his mount"

<!--
(@) [حَتَّى إِذَا كُنَّا بالْمُصَلَّى رَاجِعِينَ مِنْ بَدْرٍ بَرَكَ عَلَيْنَ]{.ar}
    "Until we were near [al-#muSallA]{.trn2}, returning from Badr, it (i.e. the camel) kneeled down to us"
-->

(@) [ثُمَّ أَرْدَفَنِي وَرَاءَهُ عَلَى الْعَضْبَاءِ رَاجِعِينَ إِلَى الْمَدِينَةِ]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:16539]{.citex}  
    Then he seated me behind him on (his camel) [al-#eaDbAE]{.trn2} while we [were] returning to [al-#madInah]{.trn2}

(@) [اتَّبَعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ **رَاكِبٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:953@]{.citex} [move to verbs of motion]  
    "I followed the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; when he was **riding**"

<!--
But when the focus is on the actual dynamic movement rather than being in a state of moving,
then the ;mudarie; verb tends to be used.
As usual, the ;mudarie; verb can be used as well.
For example:

(@) [فَجَاءَتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِى عَلَى ٱسْتِحْيَاءٍ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/28/25@]{.citex}  
    Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness.
-->

Unlike verbs of posture and temporary state,
verbs of motion are frequently used for the continuous tense.
Here are some examples:

(@) [أَدْرَكَنِي أَبُو عَبْسٍ وَأَنَا **أَذْهَبُ** إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:907@]{.citex}  
    [#abU #eabs]{.trn2} overtook me while I **[was] going** to the [jumueah]{.trn2}

(@) [بَيْنَا أَنَا **أَسِيرُ** مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَيْنَ الْجُحْفَةِ وَالأَبْوَاءِ إِذْ غَشِيَتْنَا رِيحٌ وَظُلْمَةٌ شَدِيدَةٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1463@]{.ar}
    While I **was travelling** with the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; between [al-#juHfah]{.trn2} and [al-E#abwAE]{.trn2}, suddenly a wind and intense darkness enveloped us

<!--
### The ;mudarie; verb used to indicate a static state

We would like to round off this discussion by mentioning that
the ;mudarie; verb too, can be used to indicate a static state.
Contrast example 
(@ism_fail_wearing_bedsheet) ([وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ **لاَبِسٌ مِرْطَ** عَائِشَةَ]{.ar})
with example (@ism_fail_wearing_sandals) below:

(@ism_fail_wearing_sandals) [فِإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم **يَلْبَسُ** النِّعَالَ الَّتِي لَيْسَ فِيهَا شَعْرٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1772@]{.citex}  
    "I have seen the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; **wearing** the sandals which don't have hair on them (i.e. tanned)."

Sometimes, the ;ism_fail;,
when indicating a static state,
is interchangeable with the ;mudarie; verb.
See the following pair of examples:

(@) [... وَلاَ آخَرُ قَدِ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهُوَ **مُنْتَظِرٌ** وِلاَدَهَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1747@]{.citex}  
    "... nor another who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is **waiting** for their giving birth"

(@) [... وَلاَ أَحَدٌ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهْوَ **يَنْتَظِرُ** وِلاَدَهَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3124@]{.citex}  
    "... nor one who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is **waiting** for their giving birth"
-->

## The ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} used to indicate a future event

In addition to indicating a static state,
another verbal meaning of the ;ism_fail;
is to indicate the future tense.

Here too, the ;ism_fail; is used instead of the ;mudarie; verb.
When a ;mudarie; verb is used to indicate a future event,
then it merely signifies that the speaker thinks that the ;faa3il; will take an action.
For example, the ;mudarie; verb
[أَذْهَبُ]{.ar}
(when used to indicate the future tense)
merely signifies the speaker’s intention of going some time in the future.

In contrast, 
when the ;ism_fail; is used to indicate the future tense, then it signifies that,
in the estimation of the speaker, the event will definitely take place.
In other words, the ;faa3il;’s future action is so settled and resolved in the speaker’s mind that
;faa3il; can already be described by the ;ism_fail;.
So, for example, if the speaker says 
[أَنَا ذَاهِبٌ]{.ar}
and the context tells us he is referring to a future action, then the use of the ;ism_fail;
[ذَاهِب]{.ar}
instead of the ;mudarie; verb [يَذْهَبُ]{.ar}, 
signifies that the speaker is so sure that he will do this action that he can already be described as a "goer".

Here are some examples of the ;ism_fail; being used to indicate the future tense:

(@) [وَقَالَ إِنِّى **ذَاهِبٌ** إِلَىٰ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ]{.ar}  
    [@https://quran.com/37/99@]{.citex}  
    And [then] he said, "Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me.

(@) [فَهُوَ **ذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ** لِلنَّاسِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2959a@]{.citex}  
    For he is going to go and leave it for the people.

(@) [إِنِّي **ذَاكِرٌ** لَكَ أَمْرًا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1925@]{.citex}  
    I am going to mention to you a matter.

(@) [سَأَلْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنْ يَشْفَعَ لِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَقَالَ أَنَا **فَاعِلٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2433@]{.citex}  
    I asked the Propher ;pbuh; that he intercede for me on the Day of Resurrection. So he said, "I will do [it]."

(@) [وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّى **جَاعِلٌ** فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/30@]{.citex}  
    And [mention, O Muḥammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority."

(@) [أَلاَ وَإِنِّي **تَارِكٌ** فِيكُمْ ثَقَلَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2408d@]{.citex}  
    Unquestionably, I am leaving amongst you two weighty [things]  
    (In English, "I am leaving s.th." can indicate the future tense.)

(@) [زَعَمَ ابْنُ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ قَاتِلٌ رَجُلاً قَدْ أَجَرْتُهُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6158@]{.citex}  
    "My maternal brother claims that he will kill a man whom I have given protection to."

(@) [وَإِنِّي **مُرْسِلَةٌ** إِلَيْهِم بِهَدِيَّةٍ **فَنَاظِرَةٌ** بِمَ يَرْجِعُ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/27/35@]{.citex}  
    "But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messengers will return."

(@) [إِنِّي **سَائِلٌ** هَذَا عَنْ هَذَا الرَّجُلِ الَّذِي يَزْعُمُ أَنَّهُ نَبِيٌّ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4553@]{.citex}  
    I **am going to ask** this [person] about this man who claims that he is a prophet.

(@) [وَيْحَكَ يَا فُلَانُ تَرَى هَذَا **كَائِنًا**]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:15841]{.citex}  
    A mercy on you O so-and-so! Do you think this **will be**?

The use of the ;ism_fail; instead of the ;mudarie; verb to indicate a future event can also, depending on context, indicate that the event is imminent, i.e. that it is in the very near future.
In such cases it can be translated using "be going to".
For example:

(@) [فَقَالَ عُتْبَةُ لَا شَيْءَ أَنَا **خَارِجٌ**]{.ar}
    [maghazi 1/38 cited by @marmor_tense@ 171]{.citex}  
    So [#eutbah]{.trn2} said, "Nothing. I am going out."

By the way, it is not just the ;ism_fail; which is used to indicate an imminent future event.
The ;mudarie; verb can also be used with this meaning. For example,

(@) [قَالَتْ أَيْنَ قَالَ **أُصَلِّي** قَالَتِ اجْلِسْ قَالَ إِنِّي **أُصَلِّي**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:560a@]{.citex}  
    She said, "Where [are you going]?" He said, "I **am going to pray**." She said, "Sit!" He said, "Indeed I **am going to pray**."

The ;ism_fail; of verbs of posture and verbs of motion
don't have any special behavior when used with a future tense meaning.
Examples:

(@) [إِنِّي إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ **لَقَائِمٌ** الْعَشِيَّةَ فِي النَّاسِ، **فَمُحَذِّرُهُمْ** هَؤُلاَءِ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يَغْصِبُوهُمْ أُمُورَهُمْ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6830@]{.citex}  
    I, ;ia;, **will stand** tonight amongst the peope and **warn** them [about] these [people] who want to forcibly seize their affairs.

## The ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} used to indicate a hypothetical event

The ;ism_fail;,
is used very commonly in conditional hypothetical clauses with [كَانَ]{.ar}.
It seems to derive its usage, in most hypothetical clauses, from its future tense meaning.
Here are some examples:

(@) [وَلَوْ كُنْتُ **مُتَّخِذًا** مِنَ النَّاسِ خَلِيلاً لاَتَّخَذْتُ أَبَا بَكْرٍ خَلِيلاً]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:467@]{.citex}  
    If I were to take [anyone] from the people as a friend, I would have taken [#abU #bakr]{.trn2} as a friend.

(@) [لَوْ كُنْتُ **مُصَلِّيًا** قَبْلَهَا أَوْ بَعْدَهَا لَأَتْمَمْتُهَا]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:5185]{.citex}  
    If I were to pray before it or after it, I would have completed them.

(@) [وَلَوْ كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم **كَاتِمًا** شَيْئًا مِمَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ لَكَتَمَ هَذِهِ الآيَةَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:177b@]{.citex}  
    And if [#muHammad]{.trn2} were to have concealed anything from what was revealed to him, he would have concealed this ;ayah;.

(@) [لَوْ كُنْتُ **قَاتِلًا** رَسُولًا لَضَرَبْتُ أَعْنَاقَكُمَا]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:3708]{.citex}  
    If I were (to kill/a killer of) a messenger I would have struck your necks.

(@) [لَوْ كُنْتُ **آمِرًا** أَحَدًا أَنْ يَسْجُدَ لأَحَدٍ لأَمَرْتُ الْمَرْأَةَ أَنْ تَسْجُدَ لِزَوْجِهَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1159@]{.citex}  
    If I were to order anyone that he prostrate to anyone, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her spouse


(@) [لَوْ كَانَ لَكَ مَا عَلَى الْأَرْضِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ أَكُنْتَ **مُفْتَدِيًا** بِهِ]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/ahmad:12289]{.citex}  
    If you had everything that is on the earth would you ransom yourself with it?

(@) [إِنْ كُنْتَ لاَ بُدَّ **فَاعِلاً** فَوَاحِدَةً]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:546@]{.citex}  
    If you must do it then (only) once.

The ;mudarie; verb is also used in such clauses, but it tends
to indicate a hypothetical _current_ situation.
For example:

(@) [لَوْ كُنْتُ **أَقْرَبُهَا أَوْ أَدْخُلُ** عَلَيْهَا لأَتَيْتُهَا حَتَّى تُشَافِهَنِي بِهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:746a@]{.citex}  
    If (the current situtation were such that) I were nearing her or entering upon her, I would have come to her so that she would [tell] it to me face-to-face.

(@) [قُل لَّوْ كَانَ فِي ٱلْأَرْضِ مَلَائِكَةٌ **يَمْشُونَ** مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/17/95@]{.citex}  
    Say, "If there were upon the earth angels walking securely, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel [as a] messenger."

(@) [إِنَّ عَبْدَ اللَّهِ رَجُلٌ صَالِحٌ لَوْ كَانَ **يُكْثِرُ** الصَّلاَةَ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3919@]{.citex}  
    Indeed [#eabd #allAh]{.trn2} is a righteous man, if only he would pray much in the night.

The ;ism_fail; can also be used in non-conditional hypothetical sentences (see section\ (kaana)).
For example:

(@) [يَا سَلَمَةُ أَتُرَاكَ كُنْتَ **فَاعِلاً**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1807a@]{.citex}  
    O Salamah, do you think you could do [it]?

(@) [أَوَكُنْتَ **فَاعِلًا** ذَاكَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ahmad:61@]{.citex}  
    Would you have done that?

The ;mudarie; verb is also used in such sentences.
For example:

(@) [أَنْتَ كُنْتَ **تَفْعَلُ** ذَلِكَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1788@]{.citex}  
    You would/may have done that

<!--
### The ;mudarie; verb used to indicate a future event

We would like to round off this discussion by mentioning that
the ;mudarie; verb too can be used to indicate a future event.
We have already discussed the possible difference in meaning between a ;mudarie; verb is used to indicate a future event,
and when an ;ism_fail; is used to do so.

Contrast example (@ism_fail_going_to_my_lord) with example (@ism_fail_anas_going) below:

(@ism_fail_anas_going) [فَقَالَ يَا أُنَيْسُ أَذَهَبْتَ حَيْثُ أَمَرْتُكَ  قَالَ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ أَنَا أَذْهَبُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2310a@]{.citex}  
    He said "O Unays, did you go where I commanded you [to go]?" I said, "Yes I am going, O Messenger of Allah"

Sometimes, the ;ism_fail;,
when indicating a future event
is interchangeable with the ;mudarie; verb.
See the following pair of examples:

(@) [أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلاً تَخْرُجُ بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ أَكُنْتُمْ **مُصَدِّقِيَّ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:208a@]{.citex}  
    "Do you think if I were to inform you that there were horsemen emerging out of the foot of this mountain, would you **believe** me?"

(@) [أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكُمْ أَنَّ الْعَدُوَّ مُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَوْ مُمَسِّيكُمْ، أَكُنْتُمْ **تُصَدِّقُونِي**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4972@]{.citex}  
    "Do you think if I told you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, will you **believe** me?"
-->

## Interchangeability of the ;mudarie; verb and the ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} 

We have described above,
the circumstances when the ;ism_fail; instead of the ;mudarie; verb,.
We would like to state that these are more like trends rather than hard and fast rules.
We sometimes find a ;mudarie; verb where an ;ism_fail; could have worked, and vice versa.

For the indication of a static state,
consider, for instance, example (@ism_fail_wearing_bedsheet)
([وَهُوَ مُضْطَجِعٌ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ **لاَبِسٌ مِرْطَ** عَائِشَةَ]{.ar}) above
and compare it with with example (@ism_fail_wearing_sandals) below:

(@ism_fail_wearing_sandals) [فِإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم **يَلْبَسُ النِّعَالَ** الَّتِي لَيْسَ فِيهَا شَعْرٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1772@]{.citex}  
    "I have seen the Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; **wearing** the sandals which don't have hair on them (i.e. tanned)."

Consider also the following two narrations:

(@) [... وَلاَ آخَرُ قَدِ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهُوَ **مُنْتَظِرٌ** وِلاَدَهَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1747@]{.citex}  
    "... nor another who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is **waiting** for their giving birth"

(@) [... وَلاَ أَحَدٌ اشْتَرَى غَنَمًا أَوْ خَلِفَاتٍ وَهْوَ **يَنْتَظِرُ** وِلاَدَهَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3124@]{.citex}  
    "... nor one who has bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and he is **waiting** for their giving birth"

Similarly, for the indication of the future tense,
contrast example (@ism_fail_going_to_my_lord) with example (@ism_fail_anas_going) below:

(@ism_fail_anas_going) [فَقَالَ يَا أُنَيْسُ أَذَهَبْتَ حَيْثُ أَمَرْتُكَ  قَالَ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ أَنَا أَذْهَبُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2310a@]{.citex}  
    He said "O Unays, did you go where I commanded you [to go]?" I said, "Yes I am going, O Messenger of Allah"

Consider also the following two narrations:

(@) [أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلاً تَخْرُجُ بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ أَكُنْتُمْ **مُصَدِّقِيَّ**]{.ar}

    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4972@]{.citex}  
    "Do you think if I told you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, will you **believe** me?"

## The ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} used with a ;madi; significance

We have seen,
in the sections above, that
the ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar} has a strong correlation with the ;ustate; ;mudarie; verb, giving an imperfect meaning.
But,
the ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar}
can also carry the significance of the ;madi; verb.
Such that it can indicate that the ;faa3il; has completed the action of the verb.
As when the ;ism_fail; was used in an imperfect sense,
here too it can indicate being in a static state.
Examples:
<!--
But
when
the ;ism_fail; without [ٱلْ]{.ar}
is used with a ;madi; significance,
it isn't used _in place of_ the ;madi; verb.
Instead, it's essential ;faa3il; meaning remains uppermost.
-->

    If I were in a state of having done [wuDUE]{.trn2}, I would have eaten it.
    
When used with a ;madi; significance,
then, according to most authorities,
the ;ism_fail; cannot usually have a ;mafulb;.
(See section\ (ref).)

## The ;ism_fail; prefixed with [ٱل]{.ar}

Consider the sentence:

(@) [رَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ]{.ar}  
    [I saw the man.]{.trans}

The
definite article
[ٱل]{.ar}
indicates that the listener
would know identity of the person who was seen because of his being referred to as
a definite entity:
[الرَّجُلَ]{.ar}
_the_ man.

Consider now the sentence:

(@) [رَأَيْتُ الضَّارِبَ]{.ar}  
    [I saw the beater~m~.]{.trans}

Now the person who was seen is identified, 
not by his virtue of being an entity,
but because of his being the doer of the verb
[ضَرَبَ يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}.
In this sense,
the noun
[الضَّارِب]{.ar}
is similar in meaning to
[الَّذِي ضَرَبَ/يَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
[the one who beat/beats]{.trans}.

Similarly, if we say:

(@) [جَاءَتِ الضَّارِبَةُ]{.ar}  
    [The beater~f~ came.]{.trans}

then this is similar to
saying
[جَاءَتِ الَّتِي ضَرَبَتْ/تَضْرِبُ]{.ar}
[The one~f~ who beat/beats came.]{.trans}

Because of the equivalence of this
[ٱل]{.ar}
to the ;ism_mawsul;s
([ٱلَّذِي]{.ar},
[ٱلَّتِي]{.ar},
etc.),
this
[ٱل]{.ar},
that is prefixed to ;ism_fail;s
(and to ;mushtaqq; nouns in general)
is called the
_;ism_mawsul;_ [ٱل]{.ar}.
We will learn more about 
the _;ism_mawsul;_ [ٱل]{.ar}
in section\ (ref).

For now, we note that when
the ;ism_mawsul; [ٱل]{.ar},
is prefixed to a ;mushtaqq; noun
then the ;mushtaqq; noun retains its capability to govern a ;faa3il; and a ;astate; governee.

So in example (@) [جَاءَتِ الضَّارِبَةُ]{.ar},
the ;ism_fail;
[الضَّارِبَة]{.ar}
is governing a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [[هِيَ]{.ar}].
And in the following example,
the ;ism_fail; is also governing a ;mafulb;:

<!--
(@) [مَرَرْتُ بالضَّارِبِ الْعَبْدَ]{.ar}  
    [I passed by the beater of the slave.]{.trans}
-->

(@) [مَنِ الْقَائِلُ كَلِمَةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:601@]{.citex}  
    [Who is the sayer of such and such speech?]{.trans}


(@) [عَاتَبْتُ الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدَ]{.ar}  
    [I reproved the promise-breaker.]{.trans}

The construction
[الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدَ]{.ar}
<!--
[الضَّارِبِ الْعَبْدَ]{.ar}
-->
can also be converted to a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;, thus:

<!--
(@) [مَرَرْتُ بالضَّارِبِ الْعَبْدِ]{.ar}  
    [I passed by the beater of the slave.]{.trans}
-->

(@) [عَاتَبْتُ الْمُخْلِفَ الْوَعْدِ]{.ar}  
    [I reproved the promise-breaker.]{.trans}

When
the _;ism_mawsul;_ [ٱل]{.ar}
is used with an ;ism_fail;,
then the ;ism_fail; includes the meaning of the verb.
So much so,
that an actual verb may be conjuncted to the _meaning of the verb_ that is included in the ;ism_fail;.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/57/18@]
For example:

(@) [إِنَّ **ٱلْمُصَّدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُصَّدِّقَاتِ وَأَقْرَضُوا** ٱللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمْ وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/57/18@]{.citex}  
    "Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allāh a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward."

## The ;ism_fail; that crosses over to the ;substantive; noun

Sometimes, the ;ism_fail; is re-used as a ;substantive; noun.
When this happens, it loses its purely verbal meaning of the doer of a verb,
and signifies only an entity, just like a ;substantive; noun.

For example,
the ;ism_fail;
[صَاحِب]{.ar}
is predominantly used as a ;substantive; noun to mean [companion]{.trans}.
With this meaning, it can no longer act as a verb-like governor.
So any
[ٱل]{.ar}
that is prefixed to it cannot be
the _;ism_mawsul;_ [ٱل]{.ar}.
And and when it is the ;mudaf; in an ;idaafah; then it must be a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.

So we can say:

(@) [صَحِبَ حَسَّامٌ يَاسِرًا فَهُوَ **صَاحِبُهُ**]{.ar}
    [@za3balawi_dirasat@ 487 citing [العدناني]{.ar}]{.citex}  
    [[#HassAm]{.trn2} accompanied [#yAsir]{.trn2} so he is **his companion**.]{.trans}

We cannot make [صَاحِب]{.ar} govern a ;mafulb;. So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [حَسَّامٌ صَاحِبٌ يَاسِرًا]{.ar}
    [@za3balawi_dirasat@ 487 citing [العدناني]{.ar}]{.citex}

With regard to their plurals,
the default behavior for the ;ism_fail;, especially when used with a verbal meaning, is to have a sound plural.
But when the ;ism_fail; crosses-over to a ;substantive; then it is more likely to have a broken plural.^[[@za3balawi_dirasat@ 503](https://shamela.ws/book/2120/503) citing [السيوطي]{.ar}]

Here are some examples of ;substantive;s from cross-over ;ism_fail;s:

|;substantive; | meaning | plural | verb |
|:---|:----|:---|:---------|
|[عَالِم]{.ar}   | a scholar                |[عُلَمَاء]{.ar}   | [عَلِمَ يَعْلَمُ]{.ar}  to know     |
|[قَاضٍ]{.ar}    | a judge                  |[قُضَاة]{.ar}    | [قَضَى يَقْضِي]{.ar}  to decree   |
|[كَاتِب]{.ar}   | a scribe                 |[كَتَبَة]{.ar}    | [كَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ]{.ar}  to write    |
|[شَاعِر]{.ar}   | a poet                   |[شُعَرَاء]{.ar}   | [شَعَرَ يَشْعُرُ]{.ar}  to be aware |
|[بَالِغ]{.ar}   | a legally mature person  |[بَالِغُونَ]{.ar}  | [بَلَغَ يَبْلُغُ]{.ar}  to reach    |
|[مُصِيبَة]{.ar}  | a calamity               |[مَصَائِب]{.ar}   | [أَصَابَ يُصِيبُ]{.ar} to strike   |
|[جَارِيَة]{.ar}  | a girl                   |[جَوَارٍ]{.ar}    | [جَرَى يَجْرِي]{.ar}  to run      |
|[طَالِب]{.ar}   | a student                |[طَلَبَة]{.ar}, [طُلَّاب]{.ar}    | [طَلَبَ يَطْلُبُ]{.ar}  to seek     |
|[شَارِب]{.ar}   | a moustache              |[شَوَارِب]{.ar}   | [شَرِبَ يَشْرَبُ]{.ar}  to drink    |
|[سَاحِل]{.ar}   | a shore                  |[سَوَاحِل]{.ar}   | [سَحَلَ يَسْحَلُ]{.ar}  to abrade   |
|[جَامِع]{.ar}   | a large mosque           |[جَوَامِع]{.ar}   | [جَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ]{.ar}  to gather   |
|[جَامِعَة]{.ar}  | a university             |[جَامِعَات]{.ar}  | [جَمَعَ يَجْمَعُ]{.ar}  to gather   |
|[قَائِمَة]{.ar}  | a leg (of a beast, furniture)             |[قَوَائِم]{.ar}  | [قَامَ يَقُومُ]{.ar}  to stand   |

In the above examples, the ;substantive; has a different (albeit often linked) meaning from the verb-doer meaning of the ;ism_fail;
In these cases it is easy to tell that the ;ism_fail; has crossed over to a ;substantive;.
In other cases, the ;ism_fail; crossover to ;substantive; can keep the original meaning of the verb-doer
but it will now be a stable innate quality, rather than the relatively incidental and temporary meaning that the ;ism_fail; has.
Here are some examples:


|;substantive; | meaning | plural | verb |
|:---|:----|:---|:---------|
|[آثِم]{.ar}     | a sinner            |[أُثَمَاء]{.ar}              | [أَثِمَ يَأْثَمُ]{.ar} to fall into sin |
|[وَارِث]{.ar}    | an heir             |[وَرَثَة]{.ar}, [وُرَّاث]{.ar}  | [وَرَثَ يَرِثُ]{.ar}  to inherit   |
|[وَالِدٌ]{.ar}    | a parent            |[وَالِدُونَ]{.ar}             | [وَلَدَ يَلِدُ]{.ar}  to beget (offspring)   |

Even for such cases, where the ;substantive; has the same (but more stable) meaning as the ;ism_fail;,
the ;substantive; can (generally) now no longer govern in a verb-like manner.
So it will not govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun, or a ;mafulb;.

An exception is made for the ;ism_fail; of transitive verb that has two ;mafulb;s.
In a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah; with the ;ism_fail; of these verbs, the second ;mafulb; is put in the ;astate;. See section\ (ref) for details.



When the ;ism_fail; that has crossed over to a ;substantive; refers to human beings,
then often, but not always, a feminine version of the crossed over ;substantive; will also exist, with a [ة]{.ar}.
So [صَاحِبَة]{.ar} is a female companion,
[وَالِدَة]{.ar} is a female parent, etc.
Sometimes, however, the ;substantive; exists for only one gender and not for the other,
e.g. [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [a girl]{.trans}.
Also sometimes, the same ;substantive; is used for both genders,
e.g.
[بَالِغ]{.ar}   [a legally mature person]{.trans},
[آثِم]{.ar} [a sinner]{.trans}.
There is often some flexibility in these cases, so 
[بَالِغَة]{.ar} can be used for  a female legally mature person.
The dictionary is the best guide in these matters.


When a cross-over ;substantive; exists, it does not mean that the original ;ism_fail; meaning has ceased to exist.
Both can continue to exist and context will clue us in as to which meaning is intended.
For example, [بَالِغ]{.ar} is used as an ;ism_fail; here:

(@3amal_mush_hadyan_baaligha_lka3bati) [هَدۡیَۢا بَـٰلِغَ ٱلۡكَعۡبَةِ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/5/95@]{.citex}  
    [as an offering [to Allāh] delivered to the Kaʿbah]{.trans}

For some cross-over ;substantive;s, however, the ;substantive; usage is predominant and the original ;ism_fail; meaning is virtually non-existent.
Such is the case for [صَاحِب]{.ar} [a companion]{trans} and [وَالِد]{.ar} [a parent]{.trans}.^[@za3balawi_dirasat@ 488 citing [سيبويه]{.ar} and others]{.citex}


## Verbs for which the ;ism_fail; is rarely used with verbal force

The ;ism_fail;, when signifying verbal force, is only rarely used for some verbs.
These include verbs like
[رَأَى]{.ar} to see,
[رَجَا]{.ar} to hope,
[أَرَادَ]{.ar} to want,
and others.
For such verbs, the ;mudarie; verb is typically used when verbal force is needed.
Nevertheless, the ;ism_fail; for such verbs has been found to be used on occasion.
Examples:

<!--
(@) [وَكَمْ مِنْ **مُرِيدٍ** لِلْخَيْرِ لَنْ يُصِيبَهُ]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/darimi:210]{.citex}  
    How many of a seeker of goodness shall not achieve it.
-->

(@) [أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ص لَمَّا انْصَرَفَ مِنَ الطَّائِفِ **مُرِيدًا** مَكَّةَ مَرَّ بِهِ بَعْضُ أَهْلِ مَكَّةَ]{.ar}
    [https://shamela.ws/book/9783/972]{.citex}  
    that the Messenger of Allah, when he departed from [al-#TAEif]{.trn2} seeking Makkah, one of the people of Makkah passed by him

    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6999@]{.citex}  
    I saw myself (in a dream) near the [#kaebah]{.trn2} last night, and I saw a man with whitish red complexion, the best you may see amongst men of that complexion



## Applicability of the ;ism_fail; to the ;faa3il;

In this section, we will discuss at what point the ;faa3il; of a verb may be ascribed by the ;ism_fail;.
For example, if a person reads or recites only one word, can he be described as a [قَارِئ]{.ar}?
Or does the person need to read/recite a large amount of text to qualify being called a [قَارِئ]{.ar}?
<!--
The answer is: it depends on what is intended to be meant by the ;ism_fail; [قَارِئ]{.ar}.
-->

In theory, the ;ism_fail; has a temporary applicability that is tied to the occurence of a verb.
For example,
theoretically, any person who has performed, is performing, or will perform an action of the verb [قَرَأَ]{.ar}, even once, can be called a
[قَارِئ]{.ar}.
This is a situational applicability.
And from context it will be understood that the person is being called a [قَارِئ]{.ar} within the situation of a certain reading or recitation.
For example:

<!--
(@) [إِنَّ رَجُلاً أَسْلَمَ فِي حَدِيقَةِ نَخْلٍ فِي عَهْدِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُطْلِعَ النَّخْلُ فَلَمْ يُطْلِعِ النَّخْلُ شَيْئًا ذَلِكَ الْعَامَ فَقَالَ الْمُشْتَرِي هُوَ لِي حَتَّى يُطْلِعَ . وَقَالَ الْبَائِعُ إِنَّمَا بِعْتُكَ النَّخْلَ هَذِهِ السَّنَةَ .]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2284@]{.ar}

-->

(@) [أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم صَلَّى الظُّهْرَ فَجَعَلَ رَجُلٌ يَقْرَأُ خَلْفَهُ بِسَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الأَعْلَى فَلَمَّا انْصَرَفَ قَالَ  أَيُّكُمْ قَرَأَ  أَوْ  أَيُّكُمُ **الْقَارِئُ**]{.ar}

(@) [سَمِعَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم **قَارِئًا** يَقْرَأُ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5042@]{.citex}  
    _The Prophet ;pbuh; heard **a reciter** reciting the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} in the mosque at night._

However, in practice, a person may have done the action of the verb many times, or is skilful in it, or does the action as his profession.
In these cases he can be described by the ;ism_fail; generally.
For example:

(@) [وَقَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ لِيُقَالَ هُوَ **قَارِئٌ**]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1905a@]{.citex}  
    _And you recited the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} in order that it be said: "He is **a reciter**."_

(@) [عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ عُبَيْدٍ وَكَانَ يُدْعَى فِي زَمَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم **الْقَارِئَ**]{.ar}
    [https://hadithunlocked.com/tabarani:5540]{.citex}  
    _[It was narrated] from [#saeId ibn #eubayd]{.trn2}, and he was called in the time of the Prophet ;pbuh; **the reciter**..._

For stylistic purposes,
the ;ism_fail;
can also be contrasted with the verb. 
Such that the ;ism_fail; will signify a description the ;faa3il;, or his state.
Whereas the verb will signify only the occurence of an action.
Consider for example, [سورة الكافرون]{.ar}:

::: {.quran}
قُلۡ یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلۡكَـٰفِرُونَ۝
لَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ مَا تَعۡبُدُونَ۝
وَلَاۤ أَنتُمۡ عَـٰبِدُونَ مَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ۝
وَلَاۤ أَنَا۠ عَابِدࣱ مَّا عَبَدتُّمۡ۝
وَلَاۤ أَنتُمۡ عَـٰبِدُونَ مَاۤ أَعۡبُدُ۝
لَكُمۡ دِینُكُمۡ وَلِیَ دِینِ۝
:::

[@https://quran.com/109@]{.citex}  
_Say, "O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion."_

Ibn\ al-Qayyim says, in the [tafsIr]{.trn2} of this [sUrah]{.trn2}, that 
the Prophet ;pbuh; is negated from worshipping the disbelievers' gods using once the verb 
[أَعْبُدُ]{.ar}
and once using the ;ism_fail; 
[عَابِد]{.ar}.
So the Prophet ;pbuh; is disassociated from their false gods from every perspective and at every time.
For the negated verb 
[لَا أَعْبُدُ]{.ar}
negates the occurence of the action of worshipping and its continuation from the Prophet ;pbuh;.
And the negated ;ism_fail; 
[وَ لَا أَنَا عَابِدٌ]{.ar}
states that the Prophet ;pbuh; cannot be described as a worshipper of their false gods, or as being in a state of worshipping their false gods.

Whereas 
the disbelievers are negated from worshipping [#allAh]{.trn2} both times using the negated ;ism_fail; [ولا أنْتُمْ عَابِدُون]{.ar}.
This is because, even if they had sometimes worshipped [#allAh]{.trn2} along with their false gods, they do not qualify being described as "worshippers of [#allAh]{.trn2}".
This epithet is only applicable to one who worships [#allAh]{.trn2} without associating any partners with him.^[@https://tafsir.app/ibn-alqayyim/109/6@]

<!--
In the following [HadIv]{.trn2}, the Prophet ;pbuh; describes how a person cannot be described as "a believer" when committing certain negating actions:

(@) [عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم  لاَ يَزْنِي الزَّانِي حِينَ يَزْنِي وَهْوَ مُؤْمِنٌ، وَلاَ يَسْرِقُ حِينَ يَسْرِقُ وَهْوَ مُؤْمِنٌ، وَلاَ يَشْرَبُ حِينَ يَشْرَبُهَا وَهْوَ مُؤْمِنٌ، وَالتَّوْبَةُ مَعْرُوضَةٌ بَعْدُ]{.ar}
-->

## The ;ism_fail; as an ;sifah;

So far, we have focused on the ;ism_fail; being used with verbal force.
But some ;ism_fail;s may also be used as ;sifah;s.
For example,
[عَادِل]{.ar} "just",
[وَاسِع]{.ar} "spacious",
[غَاضِب]{.ar} "angry",
[جَائِع]{.ar} "hungry",
etc.
And, depending on the situation and root meaning, they can have a temporary or permanent applicability.

<!--
;ism_fail;s that are ;sifah;s are typically derived from intransitive verbs.
Not true. What about qaaTi3?
-->

Theoretically, a noun on the pattern of the ;ism_fail; exists for all verbs.
So 
from the verb, [رَبِحَ]{.ar} "to be profitable" we get [رَابِح]{.ar},
from the verb, [ضَاقَ]{.ar} "to be narrow" we get [ضَائِق]{.ar},
etc.
In practice, not all ;ism_fail;s are commonly used as ;sifah;s.
So, for example, [رَابِح]{.ar} is commonly used as a ;sifah; to mean "profitable".
But [ضَائِق]{.ar} is not commonly used as a ;sifah; to mean "narrow".
The ;sifah_mush; [ضَيِّق]{.ar} "narrow" is used instead.
Having said that, 
the ;ism_fail;, even when largely unused as a ;sifah;
may, on occasion, be used as a ;sifah;, for stylistic purposes, to indicate the temporariness of a state.
The ;sifah_mush;, on the other hand, typically indicates a more permanent state.
Consider for example:

(@) [فَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكُۢ بَعۡضَ مَا یُوحَىٰۤ إِلَیۡكَ وَضَاۤىِٕقُۢ بِهِۦ صَدۡرُكَ أَن یَقُولُوا۟ لَوۡلَاۤ أُنزِلَ عَلَیۡهِ كَنزٌ أَوۡ جَاۤءَ مَعَهُۥ مَلَكٌۚ إِنَّمَاۤ أَنتَ نَذِیرࣱۚ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَیۡءࣲ وَكِیلٌ]{.quran}

    [@https://quran.com/11/12@]{.citex}  
    Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you, or is your breast constrained by it because they say, "Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?" But you are only a warner. And Allāh is Disposer of all things.

In the above ;ayah;
[ضَائِق]{.ar}
has been used instead of the more common [ضَيِّق]{.ar} to indicate the temporariness of its meaning.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/11/12@, @nahw_wafi@ 3/240]

## FINI

## The ;sifah_mush; between the ;ism_fail; and the ;substantive;

The verb essentially signifies the occurrence of an action at a particular time.
For example,
the verb [عَبَدَ]{.ar}
signifies that an action of worshipping/being subservient
the verb [بلغ]{.ar} signifies that an action of reaching
was done in 
the past.
The verb has an extremely wide

As opposed to the verb,
the ;substantive; noun
does not signify the occurrence of any action.
It refers to an entity.
<!--
The entity is referred to by a substantive noun because of some dominant feature, status, or rank.
For example,
[عَبْد]{.ar}
is a substantive noun.
-->
It refers to a person who is a slave.
[بَلَاغ]{.ar}
is a substantive noun.
It refers to a message or communique.

The verb and the substantive noun lie on opposite extreme ends of a spectrum.
The verb is narrow in time but typically wide in who may qualify as its ;faa3il;.
For example, the verb [بلغ]{.ar} restricts its applicability to the past tense. But it is very open with regards to who may qualify as its ;faa3il;.
For example,
بلغ المسافر قصده
بلغ القول الأذن
بلغ الهر علو الدرج

On the other hand,
the substantive noun is
typically narrow in who or what it refers to.
But it is unrestricted in time.
So [بلاغ]{.ar} may refer to only a message that is meant to reach a receiver and apprises him of some information.
It cannot be applied, for example,  to a cat that reaches the top of some stairs.
But when [بلاغ]{.ar} is applicable to an entity, it will typically be applicable to it for perpetuity.
(A significant event, however, can cause the applicability of a substantive to an entity to cease. For example, the substantive [عَبْد]{.ar} [slave]{.trn2} will cease to be applied to a person if he becomes free.)
In general, a substantive is not tied to any verb in order to be applicable. So [بلاغ]{.ar} can be applicable to a qualifying message before, during, or after its being sent or received.

DIAGRAM

In between these two extremes, lie the ;mushtaqq; nouns.
The ;ism_fail; is the closest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns to the verb.
It can even be used in place of a ;mudarie; verb, as we have seen, in that it can indicate the occurrence of an action and also its tense.
For example:

إن الله بالغ أمره

The ;ism_fail;, when used as a verb, is as temporary as the verb. For example:

(@) [المسافر بالغ قصده]{.ar}
    [The journeyer is reaching/will reach his destination.]{.trans}

In the sentence above, the ;ism_fail; [بالغ]{.ar} applies to [المسافر]{.ar}
only while he is reaching, or will reach, his destination.
The ;ism_fail; [بالغ]{.ar},
with this meaning,
is not an innate quality which is applicable to the journeyer.

The ;sifah_mush; lies between the ;ism_fail; and the substantive noun.
It describes an innate stable quality of its describee.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ﷻ يُبْغِضُ **الْبَلِيغَ** مِنَ الرِّجَالِ الَّذِي يَتَخَلَّلُ بِلِسَانِهِ تَخَلُّلَ الْبَاقِرَةِ بِلِسَانِهَا]{.ar}
    [https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5005]{.citex}  
    [The Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; said: Allah , the Exalted, hates **the eloquent one** among men who moves his tongue round (among his teeth), as cattle do.]{.trans}

In the example above the ;sifah_mush;
[الْبَلِيغَ]{.ar}
is a stable innate quality that is applicable to someone while he is speaking eloquently or while he is not.

## The ;ism_fail; crossing over to become a ;sifah_mush;

Often, a noun which is in the form of a ;ism_fail; can signify the meaning of a ;sifah_mush;.
For example,
the ;ism_fail;
<!--
[ظالم]{.ar}
[wrongdoer]{.trans}
-->
[قاطع]{.ar}
[cutting one]{.trans}
can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush;.
Now it can reflect an innate stable quality in 
<!--
someone of wronging and oppressing himself or others.
-->
something of being sharp and incisive.
For example,

(@) [سَيْفٌ قاطِعٌ]{.ar}
    [taj al-3aroos]{.citex}
    [a sharp sword]{.trans}
(@) [كَلَامٌ قاطِعٌ]{.ar}
    [taj al-3aroos]{.citex}
    [a incisive speech]{.trans}

The sword in example () above can be described as
[قاطع]{.ar}
[sharp]{.trans}
even while it is not being used to cut anything.


When the ;ism_fail; crosses over to having a stable innate meaning,
rather than its original temporary meaning,
then it will typically govern as a ;sifah_mush;,
not as an ;ism_fail;.

So, for example, the ;ism_fail; [راحم]{.ar} can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush; and have the stable meaning [merciful]{.trans}.
Similarly,
the ;ism_fail; [ظالم]{.ar} can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush; and have the stable meaning [unjust]{.trans}.
Now, with these meanings, these "crossover to ;sifah_mush;s"
can govern a ;mafulb;-like governee, which is originally its semantic ;faa3il;.

So we can say:

zaydun raaHim al-abnaa2
zaydun zaalim al-3abeed

But sentences like examples () and () above should only be used when context can clarify any ambiguity.
Because, without context, the nouns 
[راحم]{.ar}
and 
[ظالم]{.ar}
may be interpreted as ;ism_fail;s and give the meanings:
[Zayd is having/will have mercy on the sons]{.trans}
and
[Zayd is wronging/will wrong the slaves]{.trans}
respectively.

Compare also to section\ (ref): [Add mukrim al-diifaan to habitual governing of ism_fail]

na3t can pull towards sifah_mush 3amal.


This crossing over of an ;ism_fail; to a ;sifah_mush; is
relatively uncommon for form\ 1.
Typically, ;sifah_mush;'s that are derived from form\ 1 verbs have a different pattern from the ;ism_fail;.
For example
[شديد]{.ar}
[صعب]{.ar}
etc.

On the other hand,
an ;ism_fail; crossing over to a ;sifah_mush; is
is extremely common
for higher form verbs.^[uthaymeen]
In fact, it is the default mechanism to form ;sifah_mush;'s from higher form verbs.
For example the ;ism_fail;
[منطلق]{.ar}
means
[setting out one]{.trans}.
It can crossover to be a ;sifah_mush; when the noun [لسان]{.ar} is placed as its semantic ;faa3il;/;mafulb;-like governee.
It then has the meaning [fluent]{.trans}.
Here is an example sentence:

(@) zaydun munTaliqu -llisaani
    [uthaymeen]{.citex}  

Ocassionally, form2+ verb can form a ;sifah_mush; from  other than its ;ism_fail; (or ;ism_maful;).
samee3 can mean musmi3. [uthaymeen ghaafir al-dhanbi shadeed -al-3iqaabi]

## The ;sifah_mush; crossing over to give the meaning of the ;ism_fail;

In section\ (ref) above,
we saw how a ;ism_fail; can cross over to the ;sifah_mush;.
Similarly,
though less often,
a ;sifah_mush; can cross over to give the meaning of the ;ism_fail;.

For example, the ;ism_fail;
[مَائِت]{.ar}
[dying one]{.trans}
(from the verb [مَاتَ يَمُوتُ]{.ar})
is unused.
The ;sifah_mush;
[مَيِّت]{.ar}
[dead]{.trans}
is used instead.
Even when the ;ism_fail; is to be used in place of the ;mudarie; verb
[يَمُوتُ]{.ar},
the ;sifah_mush;
[مَيِّت]{.ar}
will be used.
For example:

(@) [إنك ميت وإنهم ميتون]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/39/30@]{.citex}  

## The ;ism_fail; and the ;sifah_mush; crossing over to the ;substantive;



## The meanings of the ;ism_fail;

## Introduction

The verb essentially signifies the occurrence of an action.
Consider the following example:
<!--
(@) [اتَّبَعَ  زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}

The ;madi; verb 
[اتَّبَعَ]{.ar}
signifies an action that was completed:
_Zayd **followed** [#eamr]{.trn2}_.

Similarly, consider:
-->

(@) [يَتَّبِعُ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}

The ;ustate; ;mudarie; verb 
[يَتَّبِعُ]{.ar}
signifies an imperfect (i.e. incomplete) action
that can have one of the following tenses:

  i. _Zayd is following [#eamr]{.trn2}_. (Present continuous tense)
 ii. _Zayd was following [#eamr]{.trn2}_. (Past continuous tense. Typically as [كَانَ يَتَّبِعُ]{.ar} but remember from section\ (ref) that [كَانَ]{.ar} can be omitted with the ;mudarie; verb if the context indicates a past tense.)
iii. _Zayd follows [#eamr]{.trn2}_. (Present habitual tense)
 iv. _Zayd used to follow [#eamr]{.trn2}_. (Past habitual tense. Again, typically as [كَانَ يَتَّبِعُ]{.ar}.)
  v. _Zayd will follow [#eamr]{.trn2}_. (Future tense)

Similarly if we say:

(@) [اتَّبَعَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    _Zayd followed [#eamr]{.trn2}_.

then the ;madi; verb 
[اتَّبَعَ]{.ar}
signifies the past tense.

In contrast to the verb,
the ;ism_fail; 
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}, 
essentially signifies that its ;faa3il; can be called a "follower".
For example, if we say:

(@meaning_ism_fail_zayd_follower_3amr_idafa) [زَيْدٌ مُتَّبِعُ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}

Then the ;ism_fail; 
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}
signifies that
_Zayd is, was, or will be, [#eamr]{.trn2}'s follower_.

In example (@meaning_ism_fail_zayd_follower_3amr_idafa)
the ;ism_fail;
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}
can be used with verbal force.
What we mean by _verbal force_ is that the ;ism_fail;,
while being a noun,
can also signify some aspects of meaning that are typically supplied by the verb.
These aspects are:

 i. the occurence of the action of verb,
ii. and its tense.

So the ;ism_fail;
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar},
while essentially meaning "follower",
can also supply the meaning of the occurrence of an action of "following".
As for the tense of when the following occurred,
the ;ism_fail; does not carry tense _per se_.
But the tense of its verbal meaning can be determined from context, the syntax of ;ism_fail;, and the lexical meaning of its root verb.

Depending on the tense,
the ;idaafah; 
[مُتَّبِعُ عَمْرٍو]{.ar}
in example (@meaning_ism_fail_zayd_follower_3amr_idafa) above may be either a ;ma3nawi; or ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.
(See section\ (ref).)
If the context indicates a past tense,
then it is a ;ma3nawi; ;idaafah;.

But if the context indicates that
the tense is future, continuous, or habitual,
then the ;idaafah; can be ;lafzi;, and
[عَمْرٍ]{.ar}
is then in the position of a ;mafulb;.
In this case,
the sentence can also be expressed as:

(@meaning_ism_fail_zayd_follower_3amr_mafulb) [زَيْدٌ مُتَّبِعٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}

Here is an example from actual usage:

(@ism_fail_nasai_3498) [وَأَنَا **مُتَّبِعٌ** فِي ذَلِكَ قَضَاءَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي مَرْيَمَ الْمَغَالِيَّةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/nasai:3498@]{.citex}  

In example (@ism_fail_nasai_3498) above,
context tells us that the tense of the verbal meaning in the ;ism_fail;
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}
is the present tense.
When translating this sentence,
we have something  of a dilemma.
If we translate the ;ism_fail;
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}
as "follower", then we will say:

(@) _I am **a follower**, in that [matter], **of** the ruling of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} ;pbuh; concerning Maryam al-[#magAliyyah]{.trn2}_.

But now we will lose the tense of the
verbal meaning included in
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}.
If, on the other hand, we translate
[مُتَّبِع]{.ar}
with the verb "following", then we get:

(@) _I **am following**, in that [matter], the ruling of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} ;pbuh; concerning Maryam al-[#magAliyyah]{.trn2}_

Now we can lose the essential significance of the ;ism_fail; which is that of the noun "follower".

Many times, the verbal meaning is prioritized for the translation and so the ;ism_fail;,
when used with verbal force, is often translated as a verb.
But we should understand that this is a limitation of translation to English, and that the original Arabic, in general, has aspects of meaning of both a noun and a verb.

Also, the verbal force that an ;ism_fail; carries can vary on a sliding scale.
Sometimes, the ;ism_fail;'s essential ;faa3il; meaning is more dominant.
For example:

(@) [لَعَنَ اللَّهُ الْخَمْرَ **وَشَارِبَهَا وَسَاقِيَهَا وَبَائِعَهَا** وَمُبْتَاعَهَا **وَعَاصِرَهَا وَمُعْتَصِرَهَا وَحَامِلَهَا** وَالْمَحْمُولَةَ إِلَيْهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3674@]{.citex}  
    [Allah has cursed wine, **its drinker, its server, its seller**, its buyer, **its presser, the one for whom it is pressed, the one who conveys it**, and the one to whom it is conveyed.]{.trans}

And sometimes its verbal (tense) meaning is more dominant.
For example:

(@) [جَاءَتْ مَلاَئِكَةٌ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهْوَ **نَائِمٌ** فَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّهُ **نَائِمٌ** وَقَالَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِنَّ الْعَيْنَ **نَائِمَةٌ** وَالْقَلْبَ يَقْظَانُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7281@]{.citex}  
    [Some] angels came to the Prophet ;pbuh; while he **was sleeping**. Some of them said, "He is **sleeping.**" Some [others] of them said, "The eye **is sleeping** but the heart is awake."

In the next few sections we will look at more examples of ;ism_fail;s in real-world usage and examine the verbal meanings that the ;ism_fail; signifies.
