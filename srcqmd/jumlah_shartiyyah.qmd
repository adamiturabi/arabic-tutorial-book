A ;j_sh; is a special sentence, which consists of two parts:

1. A ;shart;.
2. A ;jawab_shart;.

Here is an example of a ;j_sh;:

(@) [If you honor me, I will honor you.]{.trans}

@fig-cst_eng_ex1 shows the two parts of ;j_sh;.

The two parts of a ;j_sh;.
:::

<!--
A ;j_sh; is introduced by a ;adat_shart;, like "[if]{.trans}" in the example above.
Another common ;adat_shart; is "[when]{.trans}".
For example:
-->
Here is another example of a ;j_sh;:

(@) [When the sun rises, the day begins.]{.trans}

Typically,
the statement in ;jawab_shart;
is caused by the realization of the statement in the ;shart;.
So, in example () above,
my honoring you is caused by,
and dependent on,
your honoring me.
And in example (), the day's beginning is caused by the rising of the sun.

However, the statement in the ;jawab_shart; need not always be caused by the condition.^[[@nahw_wafi@ 4/422 footnote 1](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/2354)]
For example:

(@) [If you honor me, then I already honored you yesterday.]{.trans}

In example (), the ;jawab_shart;
[then I had already honored you yesterday]{.trans}
is not caused by the realization of the condition
[if you honor me]{.trans}.
Rather it is only a response that completes the sentence.

#;j_sh;s in Arabic are introduced by _;adat_shart;s_ like:
;in; [if]{.trans},
;law; [if]{.trans},
;idha; [when]{.trans},
;man; [who(ever)]{.trans},
;maa; [what(ever)]{.trans},
etc.

Amongst these ;adat_shart;s,
;in; is considered the most basic ;adat_shart;.^[[@ibn_ya3ish_mufassal@ 5/106](https://shamela.ws/book/13301/2044)]
We will study 
it
first.

## The ;j_sh; with ;in;

<!--
is used to form the _;arch;_ ;j_sh;.
Other types of ;j_sh; are formed based on the
model of
;arch; ;j_sh; with ;in;.
-->

### The ;arch; ;j_sh; with ;in;

In its ;arch; form,
the ;j_sh; consists of two parts:

1. a ;shart;, consisting of:
   a. the ;adat_shart; ;in;, and 
   b. a ;j_f3l; consisting of (at least):
      * a ;0state; ;mudarie; verb (the *;fi3l_shart;*) and
      * its ;faa3il;
2. a ;jawab_shart;, consisting of a ;j_f3l; with (at least):
      * a ;0state; ;mudarie; verb (the *;fi3l_jawab_shart;*) and
      * its ;faa3il;

<!--
In this ;arch; form of the ;j_sh;,
-->
The conditional particle ;in; directly
governs the ;fi3l_shart; and the ;fi3l_jawab_shart; in the ;0state;.^[@peled_cst@ 3-4 citing @sibawayhi@]
Here is an example of an ;arch; ;j_sh;

(@) [إِنْ يَأْتِ زَيْدٌ يُكْرِمْهُ عَمْرٌو]{.ar}  
    [If Zayd comes, ;3amr; will honor him.]{.trans}  

<!--
In example () above,

  i. The conditional particle is ;in;,
 ii. the ;shart; is [تَأْتِنِي]{.ar}, and
iii. the ;jawab_shart; is [آتِكَ]{.ar}.
-->

The conditional particle ;in; directly governs both
the ;fi3l_shart;
[يَأْتِ]{.ar}
and the ;fi3l_jawab_shart;
[يُكْرِمْ]{.ar}
(directly)
in the ;0state;.

:::

Here are some more examples of the archetypal conditional sentence:

(@) [إِنْ تَأْتِنِي آتِكَ]{.ar}
    [[@sibawayhi@ 3/63](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/916)]{.citex}  
    [If you come to me, I will come to you.]{.trans}

(@) [وإن تضرب أضرب]{.ar}
    [[@sibawayhi@ 3/63](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/916)]{.citex}  
    [If you beat, I will beat.]{.trans}

### The ;madi; verb with ;in;

A ;madi; verb can be used instead of one or both of the ;0state; verbs in a ;j_sh;.
So, for example, instead of saying:

(@) [إِنْ تَأْتِنِي آتِكَ]{.ar}

we can say, any one of:

(@) [إِنْ أَتَيْتَنِي أَتَيْتُكَ]{.ar}

(@) [إِنْ تَأْتِنِي أَتَيْتُكَ]{.ar}

(@) [إِنْ أَتَيْتَنِي آتِكَ]{.ar}

All four options will have the same meaning:
[If you come to me, I will come to you.]{.trans}.
By default,
the ;adat_shart; ;in; causes the meaning of the ;madi; verb to change into an imperfect (future) meaning.
In section\ (ref), we will see how a past tense can be explicitly specified in the ;shart; or ;jawab_shart; if needed.
Of the four combinations in examples () through () above,
examples () and () are the strongest in their composition because they display a symmetry
between the ;fi3l_shart; and the ;fi3l_jawab_shart;.
Here are some examples from ;samaa3;:

### Negating the ;shart; or ;jawab_shart;

When either of the ;0state; ;mudarie; verbs
in the ;shart; or ;jawab_shart; are to be negated,
then we can use the particle [لَا]{.ar}.
The particle [لَا]{.ar}
will not affect the government of the ;mudarie; verbs
in the ;shart; and the ;jawab_shart;.
The conditional particle ;in; will continue to govern these verbs in the ;0state;.
Here are some examples:

(@) [إِلَّا تَفۡعَلُوهُ تَكُن فِتۡنَةࣱ فِی ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَفَسَادࣱ كَبِیرࣱ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/8/73@ cited by @reckendorf_syntax@ 487]{.citex}  
    [If you do not do so [i.e., ally yourselves with other believers], there will be fitnah [i.e., disbelief and oppression] on earth and great corruption.]{.trans}  

(@) [إِنْ تَدْفِنُوا الدَّاءَ **لَا نُخْفِهِ**]{.ar}
    [@reckendorf_syntax@ 487]{.citex}  

(@) [**إِنْ لَا تَكُنْ** هِنْدٌ بَكَتْهُ فَقَدْ بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِ الثُّرَيَّا]{.ar}
    [@reckendorf_syntax@ 487]{.citex}  
    [If Hind did not weep for him, then the Pleiades have wept over him]{.trans}  
    (The ;jawab_shart; in this case has a ;madi; verb which will be discussed later.)  

(@) [اللهُمّ إنْ تَظْهَرْ عَلَيّ هَذِهِ الْعِصَابَةُ يَظْهَرْ الشّرْكُ، وَلَا يَقُمْ لَك دِين]{.ar}
    [[@maghazi_waqidi@ 1/67](https://shamela.ws/book/23680/108) cited by @peled_cst@ 15]{.citex}  

@fig-shart_arch_laa depicts the government of the ;mudarie; verbs in example () above.

While using [لَا]{.ar},
as above, to negate the verbs in the ;shart; or ;jawab_shart; is perfectly legitimate,
it is very rare.
Instead, the particle [لَمْ]{.ar} is more commonly used.
We will discuss it in section\ () below, ;ia;.

## The ;madi; verb in a ;j_sh;

A ;j_sh; with the conditional particle ;in; governing a
;0state; ;mudarie; verb in both the ;shart; and the ;jawab_shart; is the ;arch; form of the ;j_sh;,
as we have mentioned above.
But the ;j_sh; has other other forms as well.
One such form is where a ;madi; verb is used instead of one, or both, of the ;0state; ;mudarie;
verbs.
Here is an example:



The government of the elements of the ;arch; conditional sentence.

No tense, but will be discussed more in section\ (ref)

## The ;j_sh; with ;idha;

### The original temporal signification of ;idha;

;idha; "[when]{.trans}"
is a noun which originally has a
temporal (time) signification
rather than a conditional signification.^[@peled_cst@ 24 citing [@sibawayhi@ 3/60](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/913#p1); [@muqtadab@ 2/55-56](https://shamela.ws/book/6965/324#p1)]
For example,

(@) [آتِيكَ إِذَا احْمَرَّ الْبُسْرُ]{.ar}
    [[@sibawayhi@ 3/60](https://shamela.ws/book/23018/913#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I will come to you when the unripe dates redden.]{.trans}

In example () above,
the
;ustate; ;mudarie; verb
[آتِي]{.ar}
signifies its usual imperfect aspect
[I come/will come]{.trans}.
This is because example () is technically not a ;j_sh;.
;idha; signifies
"[when]{.trans}", not as a condition which may or may not occur,
but as an event which is expected to occur.


;idha; is in the ;astate; as a ;dharf_makan;.
It is governed by the verb [آتِي]{.ar}.
;idha; is also a ;mudaf;
to the following ;j_f3l;
[احْمَرَّ الْبُسْرُ]{.ar}.
<!--
A word-for-word translation that indicates this government is:
[I will come to you **at the time of when** the unripe dates redden]{.trans}

:::

;idha; usually indicates a future time.
;idha; is also most commonly followed by a ;madi; verb
in its ;mudafil;,
(like [احْمَرَّ]{.ar} in example () above).
But because of the future signification of ;idha; the ;madi; verb will (usually) give a future meaning:
[when the unripe dates [**will**] redden]{.trans}.

The past tense equivalent of example () above is:

(@) [أَتَيْتُكَ إِذِ احْمَرَّ الْبُسْرُ]{.ar}  
    [I **came** to you when the unripe dates **reddened**.]{.trans}

The ;dharf_makan;
;idh;
usually indicates a past time just like
;idha; usually indicates a future time.

### Conditional signification of ;idha;

Example () above can be transformed into a ;j_sh;.
This is done by taking ;idha; and its ;mudafil;
[احْمَرَّ الْبُسْرُ]{.ar},
and putting them in the front of
the sentence,
<!--
the ;j_f3l;
[آتِيكَ]{.ar},
-->
thus:

(@) [إِذَا احْمَرَّ الْبُسْرُ أَتَيْتُكَ]{.ar}  
    [When the unripe dates redden, I will come to you.]{.trans}

Note that we have also replaced the ;mudarie; verb
[آتِي]{.ar}
with the ;madi; verb
[أَتَيْتُ]{.ar}.
This is because when ;idha; is a ;adat_shart; in a ;j_sh;,
then, like ;in;,
it requires ;j_f3l;s in both the ;shart; and the ;jawab_shart;.
But whereas ;in; allows both (;0state;) ;mudarie; verbs and ;madi; verbs,
;idha; strongly prefers ;madi; verbs in both clauses.
Because of the typical future signification of ;idha;,
both ;madi; verbs will usually have a future meaning.

Also unlike ;in;, 
even when ;idha; is a ;adat_shart;,
it does not (directly) govern either of the verbs in the ;shart; or the ;jawab_shart;.
Rather, ;idha; governs entire ;j_f3l; in the ;shart; in an ;idaafah;.
And ;idha; itself is governed by the verb in the ;jawab_shart;.^[Some grammarians disagreed. Give Abu Hayyan's opinion.]
