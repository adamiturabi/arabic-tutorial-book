# The ;ism_mawsul;s

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the man."

If the listener (or reader) can identify 
the individual referred to by the noun "the man"
(maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker),
then there is no problem with this sentence.
But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring.
This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.

One way is to use an ;sifah; to describe the noun. For example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the _tall_ man."

Another way is to use a ;ism_isharah;, thus:

[رَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw _that_ man."

But sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. 
In this case, Arabic uses what is called a _;ism_mawsul;_ and a _;silah;_. 
<!--A ;ism_mawsul; is itself a vague noun, which is then connected to by a qualifying sentence directly following it called the _;silah;_. 
The ;silah; contains sufficient information to identify the individual intended by the speaker. -->
This example should help you understand what we mean:


```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=2.0ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ} \txarb{ٱلَّذِي} \txarb{رَأَيْتُ ٱَلرَّجُلَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connecting sentence};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connected noun};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=15.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I saw the [specific] man whom I met yesterday.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the above sentence, the ;ism_mawsul; is [ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}.
It is applied to singular masculine nouns, like [ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
<!--It signifies a specific individual denoted by a singular masculine noun.-->
By itself it may be translated as "the one~1m~ that/which/who/whom".
<!--Sometimes in sentences it is left untranslated (as above) and an implied "who", "whom", "that", or "which" is used to aid the translation.-->
It is called a ;ism_mawsul; because it is directly followed by, i.e. _connected_ to, a ;silah;.
The ;silah; contains necessary information for the listener to correctly identify the individual that the ;ism_mawsul; refers to.
The ;silah; in the above example is the sentence [لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ]{.ar} "I met him yesterday."

Note by the way, that we did not translate the pronoun "him" in our original translation (above). 
This is because it would sound unnatural in English to say: "I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met _him_ yesterday."
But this pronoun is an essential part of the Arabic ;silah; and is called the _;3aaid;_. 
We will deal with it in section\ \@ref(refer-back-pronoun) later in this chapter.

There are two types of ;ism_mawsul;s:

 1. The specific ;ism_mawsul;s
 2. The general ;ism_mawsul;s

We will study both these types separately within this chapter.

## The specific ;ism_mawsul;s

The specific ;ism_mawsul;s have a significance which is restricted to a specific individual or category of individuals, 
and its ;silah; should contain sufficient information to identify that specific individual.

The specific ;ism_mawsul;s is a group of nouns where each noun is applied to a gender and number of individuals. They are:

|;ism_mawsul;|Description|
|:--|:----------------|
|[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}|Singular masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَلَّتِي]{.ar} [EallatI]{.trn}|Singular feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Also used for plural non-intelligent beings of both genders. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّذَانِ]{.ar} [EallapAnI]{.trn}|Dual masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: [ٱَللَّذَيْنِ]{.ar} [Eallapayni]{.trn} in the ;astate; and ;istate;. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّتَانِ]{.ar} [EallatAnI]{.trn}|Dual feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: [ٱَللَّتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Eallatayni]{.trn} in the ;astate; and ;istate;. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling.|
|[ٱَلَّذِينَ]{.ar} [EallapIna]{.trn}|Plural masculine. For both intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّاتِي]{.ar} [EallAtI]{.trn} |For plural feminine intelligent beings. Also used for non-intelligent beings of both genders but [ٱَلَّتِي]{.ar} is more common there. Rigid. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling. Has the following variants: [ٱَللَّاتِ]{.ar} [EallAti]{.trn}, [ٱَللَّائِي]{.ar} [EallAEI]{.trn}, [ٱَللَّوَاتِي]{.ar} [EallawAtI]{.trn}|

### Grammatical position of the specific ;ism_mawsul;

Consider again the same example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the [specific] man whom I met yesterday."

In this example, the ;ism_mawsul;
[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}
is a ;na3t; (in the ;astate;) to the described noun
<!--
[ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} 
is in the ;astate; to match the described noun
-->
[ٱلرَّجُلَ]{.ar}.
Because 
[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} 
is a rigid noun, it will appear the same in all states without any change to its ending.

As a ;na3t;, the ;ism_mawsul; may also come as the last in a series of ;na3t;s, and can also be combined with a ;ism_isharah;. 
For example:

[رَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.]{.ar}  
"I saw that [specific] tall man whom I met yesterday."

But ;ism_mawsul;s need not only occur as ;na3t;s.
<!--They may occur as a ;mubtada;, an information, a ;faa3il;, a ;mafulb;, following a preposition, and as a ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;.-->
They may occur in various grammatical positions. 
Here are some examples:
<!--
As a ;mubtada;:

[ٱَلَّذِي رَزَقَنَا بِٱلْأَمْسِ سَيَرْزُقُنَا بِالْغَدِ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (who) provided for us yesterday will provide for us tomorrow."

As an information:

[هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the [specific] one (whom) I met."

As a ;faa3il;:

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing that) you said has reached us."

As a ;mafulb;:

[نَهَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي أَسَاءَ.]{.ar}  
"I forbade the [specific] one (who) did evil."

Following a preposition:

[أَرَادَ أَنْ يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَهُمَا]{.ar}  
"he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them"  
(28:19)

As a ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;:

[هَـٰذَا بَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the house of the [specific] one (whom) I met."
-->

As a ;mubtada;:

[وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنْفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّـٰهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/9:34@]{.aside}  
"And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allāh - give them tidings of a painful punishment."  

As an ;xabar;:

[خِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَكُمْ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1855@]{.aside}  
"The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you"

[هُنَّ اللَّوَاتِي عَلَى الْمِنْبَرِ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/darimi:36@]{.aside}  
"They are the ones which (are) on the pulpit."  

As a ;faa3il;:

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us."

As a ;mafulb;:

[رَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/41:29@]{.aside}  
"Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men"  

Following a preposition:

[أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/2:259@]{.aside}  
"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township"  

As a ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;:

[قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/58:1@]{.aside}  
"Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]"  

## The ;3aaid; {#refer-back-pronoun}

The ;silah; is directly follows the ;ism_mawsul;. 
As we mentioned in the introduction,
the ;silah; provides clarifying information for the listener (or reader) to identify the individual referred to by the ;ism_mawsul;.

<!--
### An incomplete sentence as the ;silah;

The ;silah; is, by default, a complete sentence. 
It is, however, allowed to be an incomplete sentence if it is one of the following:

 i. A prepositional phrase. For example:

    [نَامَ ٱلَّذِي فِي ٱلْغُرْفَةِ.]{.ar}  
    "The one (who is) in the room has slept."

    The ;silah; is the incomplete sentence [فِي ٱلْغُرْفَةِ]{.ar} "(is) in the room".

ii. An adverbial phrase. For example:

    [تَكَلَّمَ ٱلَّذِي عِنْدَكَ.]{.ar}  
    "The one (who is) with you spoke."

    (Remember that [عِنْدَ]{.ar} is technically a noun used adverbially, not a preposition.)
    The ;silah; is the incomplete sentence [عِنْدَكَ]{.ar} "(is) with you". 

In such cases, the incomplete sentence ;silah; implcitly includes the meaning of a verb which is usually the verb "being", like "is", "are", "am", etc.

### The ;3aaid; {#refer-back-pronoun}
-->

In the ;silah; is a pronoun that refers back to the ;ism_mawsul;.
This pronoun is called the _;3aaid;_.
and it is an essential (though not always apparent) part of the ;silah;.

Let us identify some of the ;3aaid;s in the examples we have given.


[وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ]{.ar}  
"And those who hoard gold and silver"  
;3aaid;: the plural masculine ;faa3il; pronoun [و]{.ar} in [يَكْنِزُونَ]{.ar}

[خِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ]{.ar}  
"The best of your rulers are the ones whom you love and who love you"  
;3aaid;: the plural masculine ;mafulb; attached pronoun [هُمْ]{.ar} in [تُحِبُّونَهُمْ]{.ar}

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing) that you said has reached us."  
;3aaid;: the singular masculine ;mafulb; attached pronoun [هُ]{.ar} in [قُلْتُمُوهُ]{.ar}

[رَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ]{.ar}  
"Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men"  
;3aaid;: the dual masculine ;faa3il; pronoun [ا]{.ar} in [أَضَلَّانَا]{.ar}

[أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ]{.ar}  
"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township"  
;3aaid;: the implied singular masculine ;faa3il; pronoun "he" in [مَرَّ]{.ar}

[قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا]{.ar}  
"Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]"  
;3aaid;: the implied singular feminine ;faa3il; pronoun "she" in [تُجَادِلُكَ]{.ar}

### Matching the ;3aaid; with the ;ism_mawsul;

The ;3aaid; matches the specific ;ism_mawsul; in gender and number.
And the ;3aaid; is generally an absent-person pronoun ([هُ]{.ar}, [هَا]{.ar}, [هُوَ]{.ar}, [هُمْ]{.ar}, etc.).
In the example
[وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ]{.ar}
"And those who hoard gold and silver,"
the ;3aaid; is the plural masculine absent-person ;faa3il; pronoun [و]{.ar} "they" in [يَكْنِزُونَ]{.ar} "they hoard".
And it matches the plural masculine ;ism_mawsul; [ٱلَّذِينَ]{.ar}.

However, there is an exception to the ;3aaid; being an absent-person pronoun.
And that is when the ;ism_mawsul; refers to the speaker or the addressed person, like 
[أَنَا ٱلَّذِي]{.ar}, or [أَنْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ]{.ar}, etc.
In these cases, the ;3aaid; may optionally:

 i. either be an absent-person pronoun to match the ;ism_mawsul; (as usual),
ii. or match the pronoun for the speaker or addressed person (as the case may be)

The latter is generally more common but both options are permissible.
For example:

[أَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرْتُ.]{.ar}  
;3aaid;: the singular masculine ;faa3il; pronoun for the speaker [تُ]{.ar} in [حَضَرْتُ]{.ar}  
or  
[أَنَا ٱلَّذِي حَضَرَ.]{.ar}  
;3aaid;: the implied singular masculine ;faa3il; pronoun for the absent person "he" in [حَضَرَ]{.ar}  
"I am the one (who) was present."

Here are some examples from Classical Arabic:

[أَنَا ٱلَّذِي سَمَّتْنِ أُمِّي حَيْدَرَهْ]{.ar}
[@wright@ 2/324B]{.aside}  
"I am the one whom my mother named [#Haydarah]{.trn2}"  
(The ;3aaid; is the speaker person's ;mafulb; pronoun in [سَمَّتْنِ]{.ar}, which is an abbreviation of [سَمَّتْنِي]{.ar} "she named me".)

[فَقَالَ مُوسَى يَا آدَمُ أَنْتَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكَ اللَّهُ بِيَدِهِ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2134@]{.aside}  
"[#mUsA]{.trn2} said: O [#Adam]{.trn2}, you are the one whom [#allAh]{.trn2} created with His Hand"  
(The ;3aaid; is the addressed person's ;mafulb; pronoun [كَ]{.ar} in [خَلَقَكَ]{.ar}.)

There is one circumstance where matching the ;3aaid; to the (absent person) ;ism_mawsul; is mandated.
And that is when the ;ism_mawsul; is the called-out person using the particle [أَيُّهَا]{.ar} or [أَيَّتُهَا]{.ar}.
For example,

[يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ  آمَنُوا]{.ar}  
"O you who have believed"  
not  
$\times$ [يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنْتُمْ]{.ar}  

Similarly,

[يَاأَيُّهَا الَّذِي نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/15:6@]{.aside}  
"O you upon whom the message has been sent down"  

<!--
If 
the ;ism_mawsul; is called-out to using the another particle, then again, both options are permissible.
For example,

[يَا هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي قَامَ]{.ar}  
or    
[يَاأَيُّهَا هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي قُمْتَ]{.ar}  
"O the one (who) stood up"  
-->

## The general ;ism_mawsul;s [مَنْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar}

The general ;ism_mawsul;s are unrestricted in significance, and may be applied to any individual who fits the criteria given in the ;silah;.
The most commonly general ;ism_mawsul;s are:

+ [مَنْ]{.ar} [man]{.trn}. Typically used for intelligent beings and translated as "who".
+ [مَا]{.ar} [mA]{.trn}. Typically used for non-intelligent beings and translated as "what".
+ [أَيّ]{.ar} [Eayy]{.trn}. Used for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Translated as "which", "whichever" or "any".

There are also a couple of rarely or dialectally used general ;ism_mawsul;s that we will not cover. 
These are 
<!--[أَيّ]{.ar} [Eayy]{.trn},--> 
[ذُو]{.ar} [pU]{.trn}, and [ذَا]{.ar} [pA]{.trn}.

In this section we will deal with [مَنْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar}.
We will deal with [أَيّ]{.ar} separately in section\ (give ref) later in this chapter.

Unlike the specific ;ism_mawsul;s ([ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar}, etc.),
the general ;ism_mawsul;s do not vary for number and gender.

For example:

[أُحِبُّّ مَنْ يَعْدِلُ]{.ar}  
"I love [him] who is just."

<!--
[أُحِبُّّ مَنْ يَعْدِلُونَ]{.ar}  
"I love [them] who are just."
-->

[وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ]{.ar}  
[@https://quran.com/10/42@]{.citex}
"And among them are those who listen to you."

[ٱِصْنَعْ مَا بَدَا لَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Do what seems (good) to you."

[مَرَرْتُ بِمَا يُعْجِبُكَ.]{.ar}  
"I passed by what will please you."

### [مَنْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar} after prepositions

When [مَنْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar} are directly preceded by the prepositions [مِنْ]{.ar} and [عَنْ]{.ar}, these prepositions lose their [ن]{.ar} and are joined to the following noun with the noun's [م]{.ar} doubled.
For example: 
[مَمَّنْ]{.ar} [mimman]{.trn},
[مَمَّا]{.ar} [mimmA]{.trn},
[عَمَّنْ]{.ar} [eamman]{.trn},
[عَمَّا]{.ar} [eammA]{.trn}.

The preposition [فِي]{.ar} is also often (though not always) optionally attached to these ;ism_mawsul;s, thus: [فِيمَنْ]{.ar} [fIman]{.trn}, [فِيمَا]{.ar} [fImA]{.trn}.

The remaining prepositions follow the normal rules: [عَلَى مَا]{.ar}, [كَمَنْ]{.ar}, etc.
But we will see, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, in chapter\ \@ref(questions), that [مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar} are also used as question nouns, in which case the rules of joining prepositions to them will differ.

### The ;3aaid; for the general ;ism_mawsul;s

The general ;ism_mawsul;s
[مَنْ]{.ar}
and
[مَا]{.ar}
are themselves singular masculine in number and gender.
However, they can be used to signify persons or things of any number and gender.

Their ;3aaid;s can then, optionally:

 i. Either match the gender and number of the persons or things meant by the ;ism_mawsul;. For example:

    [وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://quran.com/10:42@]^  
    "And among them are those who listen to you"  

    [قَدْ خَابَتْ مَنْ فَعَلَتْ ذَلِكَ مِنْهُنَّ وَخَسِرَتْ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3318@]^  
    "She has thwarted herself, whoever did that from them~3f~, and lost."  

    Note also how, in this example how, in addition to the feminine refer-back ;faa3il; pronouns in [فَعَلَتْ]{.ar} and [خَسِرَتْ]{.ar},
    the feminine gender of the person signified by [مَنْ]{.ar} has also caused the [تْ]{.ar} of femininity to be added to the verb [خَابَ]{.ar} (of which [مَنْ]{.ar} is the ;faa3il; noun).

    [جَمَعْتُ مِنَ ٱلْوَرَقِ مَا سَقَطْنَ.]{.ar}  
    "I gathered what fell from the leaves."

    [صَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا يَتَيَسَّرْنَ.]{.ar}  
    or  
    [صَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا تَتَيَسَّرُ.]{.ar}  
    "Pray from the units (of prayer) what is easy."

ii. Or be singular masculine to match the ;ism_mawsul; itself. This is generally more common for [مَا]{.ar}. For example:

    [وَمِنْهُم مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِۦ وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://quran.com/10:40@]^  
    "And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe in it."  

    [جَمَعْتُ مِنَ ٱلْوَرَقِ مَا سَقَطَ.]{.ar}
    "I gathered what fell from the leaves."

    [صَلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّكَعَاتِ مَا يَتَيَسَّرُ.]{.ar}  
    "Pray from the units (of prayer) what is easy."

    [لَمْ أَجِدْ مَا أَعْتَذِرُ بِهِ]{.ar} 
    ^[[[مساوئ الأخلاق للخرائطي]{.ar}:171](https://shamela.ws/book/8243/181)]^  
    "I did not find what I (could) make an excuse for with".

Both options can be utilized together as well. For example:

[بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌۭ فَلَهُۥٓ أَجْرُهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/2:112@]{.aside}  
"Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Islām to Allāh while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."  

[فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/2:38@]{.aside}  
"whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve."  

<!--
[ٱُشْكُرْ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيْكَ.]{.ar} (;3aaid; is the implied sing. masc. ;faa3il; pronoun of the verb [أَحْسَنَ]{.ar}.)  
or  
[ٱُشْكُرْ مَنْ أَحْسَنُوا إِلَيْكَ.]{.ar} (;3aaid; is the implied pl. masc. ;faa3il; pronoun of the verb [أَحْسَنُوا]{.ar}.)  
"Thank who did good to you."
-->

### Applicability of [مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar} to intelligent and non-intelligent beings {#man-and-maa-for-intelligent}

As we mentioned earlier, [مَنْ]{.ar} is typically used to refer to intelligent beings.
And [مَا]{.ar} is typically used to refer to non-intelligent beings.
However, there are some circumstances in which these roles can differ.

[مَنْ]{.ar}
may be used for non-intelligent beings when a non-intelligent being is compared with an intelligent being.
For example,
 
:::{.ar}
وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِّن مَّاءٍ ۖ

[مَنْ]{.ar}
may also be used for non-intelligent beings when 
attributes usually applicable to intelligent beings are applied to a non-intelligent being.
For example:

[أَسِرْبَ الْقَطَا، هَلْ مَنْ يُعِيرُ جَنَاحَه * لَعَلِّي إِلَىٰ مَنْ قَدْ هَوِيتُ أَطِيرُ]{.ar}
[@wright@ 2/314D]{.aside}  
O flock of birds, is there who will lend his wing  
that perhaps I may fly to whom I love  
[أَ]{.ar}: "O",
[سِرْب]{.ar}: "flock",
[قَطَا]{.ar}: a species of bird,
[هَلْ]{.ar}: "is there?",
[يُعِيرُ]{.ar}: "lend",
[جَنَاح]{.ar}: "wing",
[لَعَلِّي]{.ar}: "Perhaps I",
[هَوِيتُ]{.ar}: "I love",
[أَطِيرُ]{.ar}: "I fly".

[مَنْ]{.ar}
may also be used for non-intelligent beings when 
there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings,
and the intelligent beings are given preference.
For example:

[وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/13:15@]{.aside}  
"And to Allāh prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth"  

Similarly, [مَا]{.ar} may, in some circumstances, be used for intelligent beings. 
This may be when
there is a mixed group including both intelligent and non-intelligent beings,
and the non-intelligent beings are given preference because of their larger number.
For example:

[يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/62:1@]{.aside}  
"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allāh"  

[مَا]{.ar} may also be used for intelligent beings when
the person being referred to is vague to the speaker.
For example:

[رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/3:35@]{.aside}  
"My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service]"  

[مَا]{.ar} may also be used for intelligent beings when
the characteristics of an intelligent being are highlighted when referring to them. For example:

[فَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/4:3@]{.aside}  
"then marry those that please you of [other] women"

### Grammatical position of the general ;ism_mawsul;s

The general ;ism_mawsul; may occur in various grammatical positions. 
Here are some examples:

As a ;mubtada;:

[ما عِنْدَكُمْ يَنْفَدُ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/16:96@]{.aside}  
"Whatever you have will end"  

As an ;xabar;:

[مَالُكَ مَا قَدَّمْتَ، وَمَالُ وَارِثِكَ مَا أَخَّرْتَ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/adab:153@]{.aside}  
"Your wealth is what you have sent forward, and the wealth of your inheritors is what you have left behind."  

As a ;faa3il;:

[فَعَلَهُ مَنْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنِّي]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:668@]{.aside}  
"it was done by one who was better than I"  

As a ;mafulb;:

[اعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/41:40@]{.aside}  
"Do whatever you will"  

Following a preposition:

[وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3563@]{.aside}  
"and make me independent from (all) who are besides You"  

As a ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah;:

<!--
[أَنَا وَارِثُ مَنْ لاَ وَارِثَ لَهُ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2634@]{.aside}  
"I am the heir of the one who has no heir"
-->

[فَذَلِكَ مَثَلُ مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2283@]{.aside}  
"So that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me"

[مَا تَرَىٰ رَأْيَ مَا نَرَىٰ.]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"You do not think what we think."  
(literally: "You do not opine the opinion of what we opine.")

[أَمْرَ مَا تَحْذَرُ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"the matter of which you are wary"

Unlike the specific ;ism_mawsul;s 
([ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar}, etc),
the general ;ism_mawsul;s do not occur as ;na3t;s.
So while we can say:

[مَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.]{.ar}  
"I passed by the man who was good to me."

we cannot say:

$\times$ [مَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.]{.ar}  

We will have to say instead:

[مَرَرْتُ بِمَنْ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيّ.]{.ar}  

The general ;ism_mawsul; can, however, occur as a replacement.
For example,

[والمسلمون مَن تبع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كثير]{.ar}
[@fischer@ §421.2. Originally, from [السيرة النبوية لابن هشام]{.ar}.]{.aside}  
"And the Muslims, who follow the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2}, are many"

### Use with the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar}

The preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} is frequently used with the general ;ism_mawsul;s to restrict the applicability of the ;ism_mawsul; to a group or type. 
This [مِنْ]{.ar} may come either before the ;ism_mawsul;, or after its ;silah;.
For example:

<!--[سَأُعْطِيهِ مَا عِنْدِي مِنْ خُبْزٍ.]{.ar}  
"I will give him what I have of bread."-->

[فَأَعْطَانِي مَا كَانَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْ خُبْزٍ.]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"Then he gave me what he had of bread."

[مَنْ دَخَلَ ٱلشَّأْمَ مِنَ ٱلْعَرَبِ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"Those Arabs who entered Syria"  
(literally: "Who entered Syria from the Arabs")

[فَانكِحُوا مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ النِّسَاءِ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/4:3@]{.aside}  
"then marry those that please you of [other] women"  

[اللَّهُمَّ اقْسِمْ لَنَا مِنْ خَشْيَتِكَ مَا يَحُولُ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ مَعَاصِيكَ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3502@]{.aside}  
O [#allAh]{.trn2}, apportion for us, from the fear of You, (that) what shall come between us and disobedience of You  
(The ;ism_mawsul; [مَا]{.ar} is the ;mafulb; of the verb of command [اقْسِمْ]{.ar}.)

### Use with a repeated word to express vagueness or uncertainty

The general ;ism_mawsul;s
[مَنْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar}
are used with a word that is repeated to express a vague or uncertain quantity or quality.
For example:

[هُمْ مَا هُمْ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"They are what they are."

[نَزَلَ مَنْ نَزَلَ مِنْهُمْ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"Some of them came down."  
(literally: Came down who came down from them.")

[جَمَعْتُ مَا جَمَعْتُ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 218]{.aside}  
"I gathered what I gathered."

## Deleting the ;3aaid;

The ;3aaid; may be deleted (and its meaning is then implicit) if some conditions are satisfied.
Some conditions are specific to the state of the ;3aaid;. These are:

(a) When the ;3aaid; is the ;mubtada; of a ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence, then it may be deleted, and its meaning will be implied.
    When deleting the ;3aaid; in this case, it is preferred that the ;silah; not be too short.
    <!--In such cases, the incomplete sentence ;silah; implcitly includes the meaning of a verb which is usually the verb "being", like "is", "are", "am", etc.-->

    For example:

    [انْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2963c@]^
    ^[See also @https://sunnah.com/muslim:2963c@ and @https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4142@ for variants with the ;3aaid;.]  
    "Look at who is lower than you."  
    (instead of [انْظُرُوا إِلَى مَنْ هُوَ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ]{.ar}.)

    [وَلَهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://quran.com/21:19@]^  
    "To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth."  
    (instead of [مَنْ هُوَ فِي ٱلسَّمَوَاتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar})

    [مَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا]{.ar}
    ^[@wright@ 2/322D]^  
    I am not the one who says anything to you.  
    (instead of [مَا أَنَا بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ قَائِلٌ لَكَ شَيْـًٔا]{.ar})

    If the ;silah; is very short, the deleting the ;3aaid; ;mubtada; is permissible, though rare. For example:

    <!--
    [جاء الذي ذَكِيٌّ]{.ar}  
    The one who is smart came.  
    [[شرح ألفية ابن مالك للعثيمين]{.ar}]  
    (instead of [جاء الذي هو ذكي]{.ar})
    -->

    [لَا يَنْطِقُ بِمَا سَفَهٌ]{.ar}
    ^[@wright@ 2/322D]^  
    "He does not speak what is foolish."  
    (instead of [بِمَا هُوَ سَفَهٌ]{.ar})

(b) When the ;3aaid; is an attached pronoun for the ;mafulb; it is permissible to delete it. For example:

    [هَـٰذَا مَا كَنَزْتُمْ لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ]{.ar}
    ^[@https://quran.com/9:35@]^  
    "This is what you hoarded for yourselves"  
    (instead of [مَا كَنَزْتُمُوهُ]{.ar})

(c) When the ;3aaid; is in the ;istate;, it is permissible to delete it:

    (i) When the ;3aaid; is the ;mudafil; in an ;idaafah; whose ;mudaf; is a ;ism_fail; or the ;mafulb; implying a present or future meaning. For example:

        (@) [فَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضٍ]{.ar}
	          [@https://quran.com/20:72@]{.citex}  
            "So decree whatever you are to decree."  
            (instead of [فَاقْضِ مَا أَنتَ قَاضِيهِ]{.ar})

        (@) [قَالَ أَتَبْعَثُ إِلَيَّ مَا لَسْتَ آكِلًا]{.ar}
	          [https://hadithweb.com/ahmad:21023]{.citex}  
            "He said: Do you send to me what you do not eat?"  
            (instead of [مَا لَسْتَ آكِلَهُ]{.ar})

	<!--
        [أَخَافُ مِنْهُ ٱلظُّلْمَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ فَاعِلٌ.]{.ar}  
        "I fear from him the wrong that he will do."

        With the ;3aaid; restored, the sentence is  
        [أَخَافُ مِنْهُ ٱلظُّلْمَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ فَاعِلُهُ.]{.ar}  
	-->

    (ii) When the ;3aaid; is attached to a preposition or adverb, and the same preposition or adverb has already been used (with the same meaning) with the connecting noun or its described noun. The preposition/adverb is deleted along with its attached pronoun. For example:

         <!--
         [سِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي سِرْتَ.]{.ar}  
         "I walked in the (same) garden [in] which you walked."

         With the ;3aaid; restored, the sentence is  
         [سِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي سِرْتَ فِيهَا.]{.ar}  
         -->

         [أَنَا عِنْدَ مَنْ أَنْتَ.]{.ar}
         ^[@wright@ 2/323C]^  
         "I am at his [house] at whose you (are)."  
         (instead of [مَنْ أَنْتَ عِنْدَهُ]{.ar})

         [مَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ سُلَيْمَانُ.]{.ar}
         ^[@wright@ 2/323D]^  
         "I passed by the (same) one that [#sulaymAn]{.trn2} did."  
         (instead of [مَرَرْتُ بِٱلَّذِي مَرَّ بِهِ سُلَيْمَانُ.]{.ar})

In addition to the above conditions that are specific to the state of the ;3aaid;,
a further, general, condition should be satisfied, which is:
that the omission of the ;3aaid; be obvious to the listener, and the listener can re-construct the original meaning by restoring the ;3aaid; to get the intended meaning.

If the ;3aaid; is deleted, and the remaining ;silah; (with the ;3aaid; deleted) is valid as a ;silah; on its own right, then it will give a different meaning (even if slightly) from the original. 
And the listener will not know that the ;3aaid; has been deleted. 
In this case, it is not permitted to delete the ;3aaid;. Here is an example that should explain what we mean:

Consider the sentence:

[جاء الذي ضربته في داره.]{.ar}
[[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/168](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/167)]{.aside}  
"The one whom I beat (him) in his house, came.  

The ;silah; is 
[ضربته في داره.]{.ar} "I beat him in his house."
and the ;3aaid; is the ;astate; ;mafulb; pronoun [ه]{.ar} "him".
If we delete this pronoun, the sentence becomes

[جاء الذي ضربت في داره.]{.ar}  
"The one who I beat in his house, came.

Now the meaning of the sentence is markedly different. The ;silah; [ضربت فِي دَارِهِ]{.ar} is valid on its own right but it gives a different meaning from the original.
It does not specify that I beat _him_ in his house, just that I beat in his house, possibly others.
Because the omission of the ;3aaid; is not obvious, the sentence now does not siginify the original intent. And so deleting the ;3aaid; in this case is not permitted.

## The general ;ism_mawsul; [أَيّ]{.ar}

[أَيّ]{.ar} [Eayy]{.trn} "which/whichever" is a general ;ism_mawsul; similar to [مَا]{.ar} "what" and [مَنْ]{.ar} "who".
But it differs from 
[مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar} in a few aspects:

Firstly,
[أيّ]{.ar}
is (generally) fully flexible.
So it will display its state as a vowel mark on its final letter.
Whereas 
[مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar}, as we know, are rigid.

Secondly,
[أيّ]{.ar}
can be, and, in fact, properly is, the ;mudaf; in an ;idaafah;.
Whereas [مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar} cannot be ;mudaf;s.
For example,

[يُعْجِبُنِي أَيُّ ٱلتَّلَامِذَةِ يَجْتَهِدُ.]{.ar}  
"Whichever of the students strives, pleases me."  
([أيّ]{.ar} is in the ;ustate;)

<!--
[أَيُّ ٱلرِّجَالِ]{.ar}  
"which of the men"

[أَيُّهُمَا]{.ar}  
"which of the two"
-->

[فَأْوِ إِلَى أَيِّهِمْ يَحْمِيكَ.]{.ar}  
"So take shelter with whichever of them protects you."  
([أيّ]{.ar} is in the ;istate;)

Also,
[أيّ]{.ar}
is used indiscriminately for both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. For example,

[أَحْمِلُ أَيَّ ٱلْحَقِيبَتَيْنِ هِيَ ٱلْأَثْقَلُ]{.ar}  
"I shall carry whichever of the two bags is the heavier."  
([أيّ]{.ar} is in the ;astate;)

Note how, in the above examples, the final vowel mark on 
[أيّ]{.ar}
varies, depending on its state due to its being a flexible noun.

[أَيّ]{.ar},
like 
[مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar}, 
is itself a singular masculine noun.
And, like 
[مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar}, 
[أَيّ]{.ar}
can be used, unchanged, for both genders.
The previous example used
[أَيّ]{.ar}
with [حَقِيبَة]{.ar} which is a feminine noun.
But a feminine version [أَيَّة]{.ar} does exist and can be used with feminine ;mudafil;s.
It is, however, only commonly used if its ;mudafil; is a feminine pronoun.
For example,

[صَادِقِي أَيَّتَهُنَّ تَنْصَحُكِ.]{.ar}  
"Befriend whichever of them~3,f~ is sincere to you~1,f~."

By the way, [أَيّ]{.ar} [Eayy]{.trn} (like [مَا]{.ar} and [مَنْ]{.ar}) is also a question noun and we will discuss its properties in more detail in section ...

### The ;ism_mawsul; [أَيّ]{.ar} without a ;mudafil;

[أيّ]{.ar}
can sometimes occur without a ;mudafil;.
Technically, it will then be indefinite, and thus ;tanwin;ed.
However, it will carry the meaning of an implied ;idaafah;.
For example,

[سَأُقَاتِلُ أَيًّا يُقَاوِمُنِي.]{.ar}  
"I will fight whichever [of them, the enemies, etc.] resists me."

### The ;ism_mawsul; [أَيّ]{.ar} with a deleted ;3aaid;

Consistent with what we have already learned for the other ;ism_mawsul;s,
the ;3aaid; may be deleted in connected sentences for the ;ism_mawsul;
[أيّ]{.ar}.

For example,

[أَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
"I will reward whichever of them is truthful."  
(instead of [أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ]{.ar}.)

### Circumstance for the rigidity of [أَيّ]{.ar}

As mentioned,
[أَيّ]{.ar}
is generally fully flexible.
However, there is one circumstance in which it may optionally be a rigid noun with the final vowel mark [◌ُ]{.ar} thus: [أَيُّ]{.ar}.
This is when both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 i. [أَيّ]{.ar} is an ;mudaf;.
ii. The ;3aaid; to [أَيّ]{.ar} is the ;mubtada; of the ;silah; and it is deleted.

For example,

[أَجْزِي أَيُّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
"I will reward whichever of them is truthful."

Since this rigidity is optional, 
[أَيّ]{.ar}
may, in this case, retain its full-flexibility:

[أَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
"I will reward whichever of them is truthful."

But if both the conditions above are not satisfied then 
[أَيّ]{.ar}
shall remain fully-flexible. For example,

[أَجْزِي أَيَّهُمْ هُوَ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
[أَجْزِي أَيًّا هُوَ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
[أَجْزِي أَيًّا صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}
^[The examples generally quoted by the grammarians are (1) the verse of poetry [إِذَا مَا لَقِيتَ بَنِي مَالِكٍ  فَسَلِّمْ عَلَى أَيُّهُمْ أَفْضَلُ]{.ar}, and (2) the [Ayah]{.trn2} [ثُمَّ لَنَنْزِعَنَّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَنِ عِتِيّاً]{.ar} [@https://quran.com/19:69@]]

## Separating the ;silah; from the ;ism_mawsul;

Generally, the ;silah; directly follows the ;ism_mawsul;, as in all the examples we have given so far.
However, the ;silah; may be separated from the ;ism_mawsul; by one of the following:

  i. An oath. For example:

     [جَاءَ ٱلَّذِي وَٱللَّـٰه قَهَرَ ٱلْأَعْدَاءَ.]{.ar}  
     "The one who - by [#allAh]{.trn2} - overpowered the enemies has come."

 ii. A sentence calling out to someone. For example,

     [أَنْتَ ٱلَّذِي يَا زَيْدُ فَتَحْتَ ٱلْبَابَ.]{.ar}  
     "You are the one - O Zayd - who opened the door."

iii. A parenthetical clause, which is a sentence within the main sentence that adds information to it, but which can be deleted without affecting the completeness of the main sentence. For example:

     [قَدِمَ ٱلَّذِي أَطَالَ ٱللَّـٰهُ عُمْرَهُ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيَّ.]{.ar}  
     "The one who - may Allah lengthen his age - was good to me has arrived."

     [قَدِمَ ٱلَّذِي وَهُوَ مُبْتَسِمٌ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيَّ.]{.ar}  
     "The one who - and he is smiling - was good to me has arrived."


## Deleting the ;ism_mawsul; and/or the ;silah;

TODO. See النحو الوافي

## Sentences without ;ism_mawsul;s

There are some sentences where we might expect a ;ism_mawsul; but which are always, or often (as the case may be), expressed in Arabic without a ;ism_mawsul;. These sentences are of different types:

### Sentences with indefinite nouns needing a qualifying sentence

When an indefinite noun needs a qualifying sentence, it is natural in English to insert "that", "which", "who", etc. between the noun and the following sentence. For example, "I passed by a man _who_ was sleeping."

In Arabic, however, we will not use any ;ism_mawsul; in such sentences. 
This is because the ;ism_mawsul;s are considered definite nouns.
And therefore they may not be a ;na3t; to an indefinite noun.
So while we can say:

[مَرَرْتُ بِٱلرَّجُلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.]{.ar}  
"I passed by the man who is sleeping."

we cannot say

$\times$ [مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ ٱلَّذِي يَنَامُ.]{.ar}  

Instead, we put the qualifying sentence directly after the indefinite noun. The qualifying sentence will then not be a ;silah;, but will itself be the ;na3t; to the described noun:

[مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَنَامُ.]{.ar}  
"I passed by a man (who) is sleeping."

Here is another example:

[أَكَلْتُ طَعَامًا قَدْ بِٱلْمِلْحِ.]{.ar}  
"I ate a food (that) had been seasoned with salt."
-->

[جَلَسْتُ فِي مَجْلِسٍ قَدْ رُشَّ بِمَاءِ ٱلْوَرْدِ.]{.ar}  
"I sat in a sitting (that) had been sprinkled with rose-water."

A ;ism_mawsul; can, however, follow an indefinite noun, if we intend to start a separate sentence with it, or if it is a _replacement_ (see chapter\ \@ref(the-replacement)). For example.

[وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ]{.ar}
[@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:614@]{.aside}  
"Resurrect him to a praiseworthy station, the one that you promised him"  

[وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ]{.ar}  
[الَّذِي جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/104:1-2@]{.aside}  
"Woe to every scorner and mocker  
Who collects wealth and [continuously] counts it."  

### Sentences containing a noun with generic definiteness

Sometimes the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} 
does not determine a particular individual, but
makes a noun definite only in a generic way.
In this case a qualifying sentence may directly follow it without any intermediate ;ism_mawsul; used as a ;na3t;.^[@wright@ 2/318C]
Because there is no ;ism_mawsul;, the qualifying sentence is, again, not analyzed as a ;silah;.
For example:

[كَمَثَلِ الْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًا]{.ar}
[@https://quran.com/62:5@]{.aside}  
"like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]"  
(Note how the translator has translated [ٱلْحِمَار]{.ar} as "a donkey" because in English an indefinite noun is often used to indicate a generic type.)


[أَنْتَ ٱلْوَزِيرُ لَا يُعْصَىٰ]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 219]{.aside}  
"You are the (sort of) vizier (who) is not disobeyed."  

[هُمُ ٱلْفَوَارِسُ يَحْمُونَ ٱلنِّسَاءَ.]{.ar}
[@fischer@ 219]{.aside}  
"They are the (kind of) horsemen (who) protect the women."  

### Sentences with prepositional or adverbial phrases

If a sentence has a definite noun which is to be qualified by a prepositional or adverbial phrase, then in many cases, that phrase may directly follow the definite noun without any intermediate ;ism_mawsul; used a ;na3t;.
But using a ;ism_mawsul; is also permissible if one wishes to emphasize that the specificity of the noun.
When there is no ;ism_mawsul;, the prepositional or adverbial phrase is not analyzed as a ;silah;, but is considered attached to an implied verb that has the idea of "being", like "is", "are", etc.
When there is a ;ism_mawsul;, then it is analyzed as a ;silah;, as usual.
For example:

[سِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.]{.ar}  
"I walked in the garden next to the mosque."  
or  
[سِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.]{.ar}  
or  
[سِرْتُ فِي ٱلْحَدِيقَةِ ٱلَّتِي هِيَ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.]{.ar}  
"I walked in the [specific] garden that [is] next to the mosque."
