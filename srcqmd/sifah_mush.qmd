# The ;sifah_mush; as a verb-like governor

## Introduction

The ;ism_fail; is the closest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns to the verb.
We saw in chapter\ (ref) that it can be used in place of a verb.

The ;sifah_mush; is also a ;mushtaqq; noun.
But it is not as close to the verb as the ;ism_fail;.
In this chapter, we will explore its significance and its ability to govern in a verb-like manner.

## The form and significance of the ;sifah_mush;

TODO: rework from @nahw_wafi@ 3/281

The ;ism_fail; has an incidental meaning (as the ;faa3il; of its verb).
For example, if we say

(@) [زَيْدٌ ضَارِبٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is a beater]{.trans}

then the ;ism_fail; [ضَارِب]{.ar} [beater]{.trans} is applicable to a [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} only when he is associated with the action of beating.

On the other hand,
the ;sifah_mush;,
in general,
has a more stable and innate meaning.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 160]

So if we say:

(@) [زَيْدٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is handsome.]{.trans}

then the ;sifah_mush; [حَسَن]{.ar} [handsome]{.trans} is a constant quality that will (generally) always be applicable to a [زَيْدٌ]{.ar}.


## The ;sifah_mush; as the governor of a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun

Just like the ;ism_fail;, the ;sifah_mush; will,
by default,
govern a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 161]
Consider the following examples:

(@) [مررت بامرأة حسنة]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 161]{.citex}  
    [I passed by a handsome woman.]{.trans}  
    ([حسنة]{.ar} has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun implicated as [هي]{.ar}.)

(@) [مررت برجلين حسنين]{.ar}
    [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 161]{.citex}  
    [I passed by two handsome men.]{.trans}  
    ([حسنين]{.ar} has a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [هما]{.ar}.)

## The ;sifah_mush; as the governor of a ;sababi; ;zaahir; ;faa3il;

TODO:
sifah should be valid for both genders if mismatch.
Also for ism_fail like murDi3.
Add forward reference to ism_fail chapter.
[[@nahw_wafi@ 3/303--304](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1529#p1)]

Similar to the ;ism_fail;
the ;sifah_mush; can govern a ;zaahir; ;faa3il;.
So we can say:

(@) [مررت برجل حسن وجهه]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1077]{.citex}  

(@) [مررت برجلين حسن أبواهما]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1077]{.citex}  

(@) [مررت برجال حسن آباؤهم]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1077]{.citex}  

(@) [الرجال كريمة أمهاتهم]{.ar}

(@) [رأيت الرجالَ الكريمةَ أمهاتهم]{.ar}


Also similar to the ;ism_fail;,
when ;sifah_mush;'s ;faa3il; is a broken plural
(as in example () above [آباؤهم]{.ar}),
then the ;sifah_mush; is permitted, and preferred, to also be a broken plural.^[[@nahw_wafi@ 3/453–454](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1679#p1); [fawzan_sharh_qatr 248](https://shamela.ws/book/2135/248#p1); [@sharh_qatr_alnada@ 288](https://shamela.ws/book/6970/263)]

So we can say:

(@) [مررت برجال حسانٍ آباؤهم]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1077]{.citex}  

(@) [هؤلاءِ زملاءُ كرامٌ آباؤهم]{.ar}
    [[@nahw_wafi@ 3/453](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1679#p1)]{.citex}

But if the ;faa3il; of the ;sifah_mush; is a sound plural,
then it is preferred that the ;sifah_mush; remain singular.
Examples:

(@) [هؤلاء زملاءُ كريم والدوهم]{.ar}
    [[@nahw_wafi@ 3/454](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1680#p1)]{.citex}

(@) [هؤلاء زميلات كريمة والداتهن]{.ar}
    [[@nahw_wafi@ 3/454](https://shamela.ws/book/10641/1680#p1)]{.citex}


By the way, when the ;sifah_mush; is a ;na3t;,
then instead of using a ;sababi; na3t
(as in examples () above),
we can use a sentence ;na3t;.
So instead of saying
[مررت برجل حسنٍ وجهه]{.ar},
we can say:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنٌ وجهه]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1076]{.citex}  

Now the ;na3t; is the sentence
[حسنٌ وجهُه]{.ar}
[handsome, his face is]{.trans}.
[حسن]{.ar} in this sentence is a fronted ;xabar;.

## The ;sifah_mush; cannot govern a non-;sababi; ;zaahir; ;faa3il;

In section\ (ref) above,
we saw that an ;ism_fail; can govern a
non-;sababi; ;zaahir; ;faa3il;.
Unlike the ;ism_fail;
the ;sifah_mush; can only govern a ;sababi; ;zaahir; ;faa3il;.
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [مررت برجل حَسَنٍ عمرٌو في داره]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1075]{.citex}  
    [I passed a man [whom] [#eamr]{.trn2} was handsome in his house.]{.trans}  

## The ;sifah_mush; as the governor of a ;astate; governee

### With a definite ;astate; governee

Consider the sentence:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنٍ وجهُه]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1077]{.citex}

In this sentence,
the ;sifah_mush; has a definite ;sababi; ;faa3il;
[وجهه]{.ar}.
This sentence is transformed in the following manner^[@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1080]:

Firstly, the base noun pronoun
[ه]{.ar}
in
[وجهه]{.ar}
is transferred to being a ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun of the ;sifah_mush;
[حسن]{.ar}.

Secondly,
[وجه]{.ar},
with its base noun pronoun
[ه]{.ar}
eliminated, is made into
[الوجه]{.ar}
to keep it definite
(to match [وجهه]{.ar} which was also definite).

Thirdly,
because
the ;sifah_mush;
[حسن]{.ar}
already has a ;faa3il;
(its ;mustatir; ;faa3il; pronoun [هو]{.ar}),
the noun
[الوجه]{.ar}
cannot be its ;faa3il;.
So it is made into what we will call a
_;mafulb;-like_ governee.
So it is put into the ;astate; thus:
[الْوَجْهَ]{.ar}.

We call [الْوَجْهَ]{.ar} a ;mafulb;-like governee, and not a true ;mafulb; because, in meaning, it is still the ;faa3il; of the ;sifah_mush;
[حسن]{.ar}.
The ;sifah_mush;
[حسن]{.ar}
is derived from an intransitive verb
[حَسُنَ]{.ar}
which does not take a ;mafulb;.

With this transformation,
the sentence becomes:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنٍ الوجهَ]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1080]{.citex}

It is important to note that this transformation affects only the syntax of the sentence, but not its meaning.
The ;sifah_mush;
[حسن]{.ar}
is still describing a quality of [الوجه]{.ar},
not [رجل]{.ar}.

But now that [الوجه]{.ar} is not syntactically the ;faa3il; of the ;sifah_mush;,
the ;sifah_mush; is dualized in number and gender to match its syntactic referent ([رجل]{.ar} in example () above).
So we will say:

(@) [مررت برجلين حسنين الوجهين]{.ar}
(@) [جاءت المرأتان الحسنتان الوجهين]{.ar}


A sentence with a ;mafulb;-like governee,
like in example ()
[مررت برجل حسنٍ الوجهَ]{.ar}
above,
while grammatically correct, is rarely used in practice.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 166]
The main purpose of the ;mafulb;-like governee is that it is used as a stepping stone for another transformation:
and that is into a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 167]
We will see this in section\ (ref) below, ;ia;.

<!--
#### Transformation of ;faa3il; which is an ;mudaf; {.unnumbered}

As a sub-case of the above transformation, consider the example:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنٍ وجهُ أبيه]{.ar}

We can transform this sentence to:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنٍ وجهَ الأب]{.ar}
Similarly the sentence:

(@) [مررت بالمرأة الحسن وجهُ أمها]{.ar}

can be transformed to:

(@) [مررت بالمرأة الحسنة وجهَ الأم]{.ar}

We will revisit this sort of sentence when we discuss ;lafzi; ;idaafah; in section\ (ref) below.
–->

### With an indefinite ;astate; governee

Remember from section\ (ref),
that the ;tamyiz; is a ;astate; governee that specifies the scope of its governor.
So we can say, for example:

(@) [مررت برجل حسن وجهًا]{.ar}
    [@baseet_ibn_abi_rabee3@ 1080]{.citex}

(@) [جاءت المرأة الحسنة وجهًا]{.ar}

(@) [الزيدون حسنون وجوها]{.ar}
    [@abu_hayyan_tadhyeel@ 9/241]{.citex}  

The ;tamyiz; is thus very commonly used with the ;sifah_mush;.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 167 citing @radiy_kafiyah@ 3/439]

### The word order of the ;sifah_mush; and its ;astate; ;governee;

Recall from section\ (ref) above that the ;astate; governee of a ;ism_fail; is permitted to precede its governing ;ism_fail; in word order.
So we can say:

(@) [زيد عمرا ضارب]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/143]{.citex}

But this is not permitted for the ;sifah_mush;.^ [@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 1/259; @ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/143]
So we cannot say:

(@) [زَيْدٌ الْوَجْهَ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/143]{.citex}

## #;lazfi; ;idaafah; with the ;sifah_mush;

Remember from section\ (ref) that a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is formed between a governing noun and its ;astate; governee.
<!--
It cannot be formed between a governing noun and its ;faa3il;.
So the following constructions,
which have a ;zaahir; ;sababi; ;faa3il;,
do not form a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;:

* Indefinite ;sifah_mush;: [حَسَنٌ وَجْهُهُ]{.ar}
* Definite ;sifah_mush;: [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهُهُ]{.ar}
-->
We have discussed the following constructions of a ;sifah_mush; with a ;astate; governee:
 
1. The ;sifah_mush; with a (definite) ;mafulb;-like governee 
<!--
without ;idaafah;:
-->

   a. Indefinite ;sifah_mush;: [حَسَنٌ الْوَجْهَ]{.ar}
   b. Definite ;sifah_mush;: [الْحَسَنُ الْوَجْهَ]{.ar}
<!--
2. The ;sifah_mush; with a (definite) ;mafulb;-like governee with ;idaafah;:

   a. Indefinite ;sifah_mush;: [حَسَنٌ وَجْهَ الأبِ]{.ar}
   b. Definite ;sifah_mush;: [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهَ الأبِ]{.ar}
-->
2. The ;sifah_mush; with an (indefinite) ;tamyiz; governee:

   a. Indefinite ;sifah_mush;: [حَسَنٌ وَجْهًا]{.ar}
   b. Definite ;sifah_mush;: [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهًا]{.ar}

Constructions 1a and 1b are both form a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 171]
In fact, the ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is the dominant form of usage for such constructions.
So we will say:

(@) [مررت برجل حسنِ الوجهِ]{.ar}

(@) [جاء الرجل الحسنُ الوجهِ]{.ar}

Here are some more examples with the feminine, dual, and plural.
Note that, because [الوجه]{.ar} is a ;astate; governee, and not the ;faa3il;,
of the ;sifah_mush;, therefore, the ;sifah_mush; is feminized, dualized, or pluralized to match its referent, not [الوجه]{.ar}.

(@) [هند حسنة الوجه]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 3/439]{.citex}

(@) [الزيدان حسنا الوجهين]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 3/439]{.citex}

(@) [الزيدون حسنو الوجوه]{.ar}
    [@radiy_kafiyah@ 3/439]{.citex}

Construction 2a
[حَسَنٌ وَجْهًا]{.ar}
can also form a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 171]
So we can say:

(@) [زيد حسنُ وجهٍ]{.ar}

Construction 2b
[الْحَسَنُ وَجْهًا]{.ar}, 
however, does not
form a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 169]
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [جاءت المرأة الحسنةُ وجهٍ]{.ar}

## Uncommon constructions of the ;sifah_mush;

There are some constructions of the ;sifah_mush;,
that are uncommonly found.
Some are disagreed upon with regard to their grammatical correctness.
Some grammarians allow some of them unconditionally, others by poetic license only, while others would disallow them.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 162--170]{.citex}

We list these constructions here for compleness:

#### Governing a ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

(@) [حَسَنٌ الْوَجْهُ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 162]{.citex}

(@) [الْحَسَنُ الْوَجْهُ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 162]{.citex}

(@) [حَسَنٌ وَجْهٌ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 163]{.citex}

(@) [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهٌ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 163]{.citex}

#### Governing a ;astate; governee {.unnumbered}

(@) [حَسَنٌ وَجْهَهُ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 166]{.citex}

(@) [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهَهُ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 166]{.citex}

#### In a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; {.unnumbered}

(@) [حَسَنُ وَجْهِهِ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 169]{.citex}

When the ;sifah_mush; is defined by [أل]{.ar}
and the semantic ;faa3il; is not defined by [أل]{.ar},
then a ;lafzi; ;idaafah;
is disallowed.^[@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 166]{.citex}
For example:

(@) ;x; [الْحَسَنُ وَجْهِهِ]{.ar} [@su3ood_dameer_mustatir@ 169]{.citex}

## #;lafzi; ;idaafah; to an ;idaafah;

It is possible for the ;faa3il; of a ;sifah_mush; to itself be in an ;idaafah;.
For example:

(@) [زَيْدٌ حَسَنٌ وَجْهُ أَبِيهِ]{.ar}

(@) [رَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ الطَّوِيلَةَ لِحْيَةُ أَبِيهِ]{.ar}

#;lafzi; ;idaafah;s can, in general, be formed from such constructions
after, of course, first transforming the ;faa3il;s into ;astate; governees.

But
when the ;sifah_mush; is defined by [أل]{.ar},
then a ;lafzi; ;idaafah; is only permitted,
if the ;mudafil; of semantic ;faa3il; also is defined by [أل]{.ar}.^[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 3/145--146]
Compare this with section\ (ref) for the ;ism_fail;.
Examples:

(@) ;v; [زَيْدٌ حَسَنُ وَجْهِ الْأَبِ]{.ar}

(@) ;v; [زَيْدٌ حَسَنُ وَجْهِ أَبٍ]{.ar}

(@) ;v; [زَيْدٌ حَسَنُ وَجْهِ أَبِيهِ]{.ar}

(@) ;v; [رَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ الطَّوِيلَ لِحْيَةِ الْأَبِ]{.ar}

(@) ;x; [رَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ الطَّوِيلَ لِحْيَةِ أَبٍ]{.ar}

(@) ;x; [رَأَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ الطَّوِيلَ لِحْيَةِ أَبِيهِ]{.ar}

## Introduction

The ;mushtaqq; nouns,
like the ;ism_fail; and the ;sifah_mush;,
are technically nouns.
But because of their derivation,
and close association with the verbs,
they can have some verbal qualities.
We have already seen how, like verbs,
they can govern a ;faa3il; and a ;mafulb;
(in the case of the ;sifah_mush;: a ;mafulb;-like governee).

In this chapter,
we will study the meanings that these ;mushtaqq; nouns can signify,
especially when they behave as verb-like governors.

## Sections for the ;ism_fail;

## The ;sifah_mush; between the ;ism_fail; and the ;substantive;

The verb essentially signifies the occurrence of an action at a particular time.
For example,
the verb [عَبَدَ]{.ar}
signifies that an action of worshipping/being subservient
the verb [بلغ]{.ar} signifies that an action of reaching
was done in 
the past.
The verb has an extremely wide

As opposed to the verb,
the ;substantive; noun
does not signify the occurrence of any action.
It refers to an entity.
<!--
The entity is referred to by a substantive noun because of some dominant feature, status, or rank.
For example,
[عَبْد]{.ar}
is a substantive noun.
-->
It refers to a person who is a slave.
[بَلَاغ]{.ar}
is a substantive noun.
It refers to a message or communique.

The verb and the substantive noun lie on opposite extreme ends of a spectrum.
The verb is narrow in time but typically wide in who may qualify as its ;faa3il;.
For example, the verb [بلغ]{.ar} restricts its applicability to the past tense. But it is very open with regards to who may qualify as its ;faa3il;.
For example,
بلغ المسافر قصده
بلغ القول الأذن
بلغ الهر علو الدرج

On the other hand,
the substantive noun is
typically narrow in who or what it refers to.
But it is unrestricted in time.
So [بلاغ]{.ar} may refer to only a message that is meant to reach a receiver and apprises him of some information.
It cannot be applied, for example,  to a cat that reaches the top of some stairs.
But when [بلاغ]{.ar} is applicable to an entity, it will typically be applicable to it for perpetuity.
(A significant event, however, can cause the applicability of a substantive to an entity to cease. For example, the substantive [عَبْد]{.ar} [slave]{.trn2} will cease to be applied to a person if he becomes free.)
In general, a substantive is not tied to any verb in order to be applicable. So [بلاغ]{.ar} can be applicable to a qualifying message before, during, or after its being sent or received.

DIAGRAM

In between these two extremes, lie the ;mushtaqq; nouns.
The ;ism_fail; is the closest of the ;mushtaqq; nouns to the verb.
It can even be used in place of a ;mudarie; verb, as we have seen, in that it can indicate the occurrence of an action and also its tense.
For example:

إن الله بالغ أمره

The ;ism_fail;, when used as a verb, is as temporary as the verb. For example:

(@) [المسافر بالغ قصده]{.ar}
    [The journeyer is reaching/will reach his destination.]{.trans}

In the sentence above, the ;ism_fail; [بالغ]{.ar} applies to [المسافر]{.ar}
only while he is reaching, or will reach, his destination.
The ;ism_fail; [بالغ]{.ar},
with this meaning,
is not an innate quality which is applicable to the journeyer.

The ;sifah_mush; lies between the ;ism_fail; and the substantive noun.
It describes an innate stable quality of its describee.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ﷻ يُبْغِضُ **الْبَلِيغَ** مِنَ الرِّجَالِ الَّذِي يَتَخَلَّلُ بِلِسَانِهِ تَخَلُّلَ الْبَاقِرَةِ بِلِسَانِهَا]{.ar}
    [https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5005]{.citex}  
    [The Messenger of Allah ;pbuh; said: Allah , the Exalted, hates **the eloquent one** among men who moves his tongue round (among his teeth), as cattle do.]{.trans}

In the example above the ;sifah_mush;
[الْبَلِيغَ]{.ar}
is a stable innate quality that is applicable to someone while he is speaking eloquently or while he is not.

## The ;ism_fail; crossing over to become a ;sifah_mush;

Often, a noun which is in the form of a ;ism_fail; can signify the meaning of a ;sifah_mush;.
For example,
the ;ism_fail;
<!--
[ظالم]{.ar}
[wrongdoer]{.trans}
-->
[قاطع]{.ar}
[cutting one]{.trans}
can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush;.
Now it can reflect an innate stable quality in 
<!--
someone of wronging and oppressing himself or others.
-->
something of being sharp and incisive.
For example,

(@) [سَيْفٌ قاطِعٌ]{.ar}
    [taj al-3aroos]{.citex}
    [a sharp sword]{.trans}
(@) [كَلَامٌ قاطِعٌ]{.ar}
    [taj al-3aroos]{.citex}
    [a incisive speech]{.trans}

The sword in example () above can be described as
[قاطع]{.ar}
[sharp]{.trans}
even while it is not being used to cut anything.


When the ;ism_fail; crosses over to having a stable innate meaning,
rather than its original temporary meaning,
then it will typically govern as a ;sifah_mush;,
not as an ;ism_fail;.

So, for example, the ;ism_fail; [راحم]{.ar} can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush; and have the stable meaning [merciful]{.trans}.
Similarly,
the ;ism_fail; [ظالم]{.ar} can cross over to become a ;sifah_mush; and have the stable meaning [unjust]{.trans}.
Now, with these meanings, these "crossover to ;sifah_mush;s"
can govern a ;mafulb;-like governee, which is originally its semantic ;faa3il;.

So we can say:

zaydun raaHim al-abnaa2
zaydun zaalim al-3abeed

But sentences like examples () and () above should only be used when context can clarify any ambiguity.
Because, without context, the nouns 
[راحم]{.ar}
and 
[ظالم]{.ar}
may be interpreted as ;ism_fail;s and give the meanings:
[Zayd is having/will have mercy on the sons]{.trans}
and
[Zayd is wronging/will wrong the slaves]{.trans}
respectively.

Compare also to section\ (ref): [Add mukrim al-diifaan to habitual governing of ism_fail]

na3t can pull towards sifah_mush 3amal.


This crossing over of an ;ism_fail; to a ;sifah_mush; is
relatively uncommon for form\ 1.
Typically, ;sifah_mush;'s that are derived from form\ 1 verbs have a different pattern from the ;ism_fail;.
For example
[شديد]{.ar}
[صعب]{.ar}
etc.

On the other hand,
an ;ism_fail; crossing over to a ;sifah_mush; is
is extremely common
for higher form verbs.^[uthaymeen]
In fact, it is the default mechanism to form ;sifah_mush;'s from higher form verbs.
For example the ;ism_fail;
[منطلق]{.ar}
means
[setting out one]{.trans}.
It can crossover to be a ;sifah_mush; when the noun [لسان]{.ar} is placed as its semantic ;faa3il;/;mafulb;-like governee.
It then has the meaning [fluent]{.trans}.
Here is an example sentence:

(@) zaydun munTaliqu -llisaani
    [uthaymeen]{.citex}  

## The ;sifah_mush; crossing over to give the meaning of the ;ism_fail;

In section\ (ref) above,
we saw how a ;ism_fail; can cross over to the ;sifah_mush;.
Similarly,
though less often,
a ;sifah_mush; can cross over to give the meaning of the ;ism_fail;.

For example, the ;ism_fail;
[مَائِت]{.ar}
[dying one]{.trans}
(from the verb [مَاتَ يَمُوتُ]{.ar})
is unused.
The ;sifah_mush;
[مَيِّت]{.ar}
[dead]{.trans}
is used instead.
Even when the ;ism_fail; is to be used in place of the ;mudarie; verb
[يَمُوتُ]{.ar},
the ;sifah_mush;
[مَيِّت]{.ar}
will be used.
For example:

(@) [إنك ميت وإنهم ميتون]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/39/30@]{.citex}  

## The ;ism_fail; and the ;sifah_mush; crossing over to the ;substantive;
