# The government of the preposition

;wip_warn;


## The need for governing the preposition

In the Arabic grammatical model, prepositional phrases are ;fadlah; elements.
In order to bring a ;fadlah; stateful element into a sentence, a suitable element of the original sentence must act as governor of the new ;fadlah; element.
For example, consider the sentence

(@ex000142) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd sat."

We would like to add the prepositional phrase
[عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
"on the ground" to the sentence, thus:

(@sentence-verb-gov-prep-zayd-sat-ground) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd sat on the ground."

In order to do this, a suitable element in the original sentence 
([جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar})
must act as the governor for the preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
The verb
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
is this suitable element.

Now, you may be thinking:
we introduced the concept of government for determining the state of an element.
But prepositions don't have state. So why should they need to be governed, and in what manner may they be governed?

This is a valid objection. 
"Governing" a preposition is definitively problematic.^[@owens_foundations_grammar@ 177]
However, we can work around this problem with the following reasoning:

<!--
The preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is followed by the
[ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
in the ;istate;.
-->
The noun
[ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}
is governed by the preposition
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
and not directly by the verb
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
This is because it is the preposition which _causes_ the noun following it to be in the ;istate;.
In order to bring the ;fadlah; (stateful) element
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}
in the sentence,
we have to establish an unbroken chain of ;3aamil;-;ma3mul; dependencies that links back to a governing element in the original sentence.
Saying that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
allows us to accomplish this.
So
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
will govern
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
And
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
will govern
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}.

Another way to look at this is that a prepositional phrase may be parsed (virtually) as a ;mafulb;.^[@kasher_intransitive_verb@ §3.1 124 citing [ابن جني]{.ar}; @nahw_wafi@ 2/439; @owens_foundations_grammar@ 176 citing [المبرد]{.ar}, [ابن جني]{.ar}, [الزجاجي]{.ar}.]
Consider the example:

(@sentence-pass-zayd) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    "I passed by Zayd."

In the above example, the prepositional phrase
[بِزَيْدٍ]{.ar}
may be parsed (virtually) as in the ;astate; as a ;mafulb;.
So much so, that if we wish to add a second ;maful; using a ;3atf; then it may be added in the ;astate;.
For example:

(@ex000143) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَعَمْرًا]{.ar}
    ^[Not all grammarians permit this. See @ali_hani_ta3alluq@ footnote 34 for details.]  
    "I passed by Zayd and [#eamr]{.trn2}."

Of course the more usual 
[مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٍو]{.ar}
is also permitted.

So we can consider the verb as governing the entire prepositional phrase in the ;astate;.
And within the prepositional phrase, the preposition governs its following noun in the ;istate;.

ADD DIAGRAM



<!--
([جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}).
it has to be by means of its governor
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
So if we say that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
then this allows us to establish the necessary link of dependencies

So saying that
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar}
is governed by
[جَلَسَ]{.ar}
allows us to have a (necessarily) unbroken dependency of governorns to add the ;fadlah; (and stateful) element 
[ٱلْأَرْض]{.ar}.
-->

## Prepositions not needing a governor

What we have just said regarding a preposition requiring a governor is true of _essential_ prepositions.
An essential preposition is that which, by its addition, gives a distinctly new meaning to the sentence.
They are also used to connect an indirect ;maful; to its governing verb.
The preposition [ب]{.ar} in (@sentence-pass-zayd) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ]{.ar} is an example of an essential preposition.

There also exist _non-essential_ prepositions.
These merely give emphasis to an existing meaning in the sentence.
Non-essential prepositions do not need a governor.
Here is an example of a non-essential preposition:

(@ex000144) [ما جاء من رجلٍ]{.ar}
    [@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]{.citex}  
    "Not a man came."

The preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} only emphasizes the meaning of the sentence.
If we drop if the basic meaning would remain the same:

(@ex000145) [ما جاء رجلٌ]{.ar}
    [@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]{.citex}  
    "Not a man came."

By the way,
[مِنْ]{.ar} happens to be a non-essential preposition in the example above.
But it may be an essential preposition in other sentences.
For example:

(@ex000146) [خَرَجَ زَيْدٌ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd came out from the house."

## Valid governors of the preposition

The verb is the typical governor of the preposition.
We have already given an example of a verb governing a prepostion: (@sentence-verb-gov-prep-zayd-sat-ground) [جَلَسَ زَيْدٌ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ]{.ar}.
Besides the verb, nouns that have the effect of a verb may also govern the preposition.
Such nouns include:

##### The ;masdar; {.unnumbered}

Also included are ;mushtaqq; nouns like:

##### The ;ism_fail; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;ism_maful; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;sifah_mush; {.unnumbered}

##### The ;sighah_mub;s {.unnumbered}

##### The ;af3al; {.unnumbered}

<!--
Even ;mushtaqq; nouns that don't typically govern a ;mafulb; 
(like the ;ism_zaman; and the ;ism_makan;)
are permitted to govern a preposition^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/440 citing @sabban@ 2/443. But [#abU #HayyAn]{.trn2} did not allow this (see ).]:
-->

Grammarians differ regarding whether the 
the ;ism_zaman; and the ;ism_makan;
are permitted to govern a preposition.
Some grammarians allow them to govern prepositions.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/440 citing @sabban@ 2/443]
Others disagree.^[@ibn_jinni_khasaais@ 2/209]
Here are examples (considering them permissible) as governors:

##### The ;ism_zaman; {.unnumbered}

(@ex000147) [انقضى مسعاك لتأييد الحق]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/440]{.citex}  
    "Your [period of] effort for aiding the truth has ended."

##### The ;ism_makan; {.unnumbered}

(@ex000148) [رأيت مدخلك إلى الدار]{.ar}
    [@sabban@ 2/443]{.citex}  
    "I saw your [place of] entrance to the house."


Also permitted as governorns are ;jamid; nouns used with an adjectival meaning.
For example:

## One governor governing multiple prepositions

One governor can govern multiple different prepositions with no problems.
For example:

But if the multiple governees are the same prepositon, then in general they may not be governed by the same governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444 footnote 3]
So we can't say:

(@ex000149) ;x; [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِعَمْرٍو]{.ar}
    [@tasreeh_hashiyat_yasin@ 1/378]{.citex}  
    "I passed by Zayd by [#eamr]{.trn2}"  
    (although, separting the second preposition with a ;3atf; is of course allowed: [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ وَبِعَمْرٍو]{.ar}.)

But if the same preposition is used with different meanings then it is permissible to have them being governed by the same governor.
For example:

(@ex000150) [مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ بِٱلْبَادِيَةِ]{.ar}
    [@tasreeh_hashiyat_yasin@ 1/378]{.citex}  
    "I passed _by_ Zayd _in_ the desert."

If the first preposition restricts the verb, and the second preposition is applied after the verb has been restricted, then too may the multiple same prepositions be used.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444 footnote 3]
For example:

(@ex000151) [كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا مِنْهَا مِنْ ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقًا]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/25@]{.citex}  
    (The first [مِنْ]{.ar} restricts the governing verb [رُزِقُوا]{.ar} to [ٱلْجَنًّات]{.ar} "the gardens". And the second [مِنْ]{.ar} is restricted to "from the fruit from the gardens."^[@https://tafsir.app/kashaf/2/25@])

## A meaningful connection between the preposition and its governor

In order for a preposition to be governed by a governor,
there needs to be a meaningful connection between the governor and the governed prepositional phrase.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/442D--445, @maani_nahw@ 3/131--133]

Consider the following example:

(@ex000152) [شَبَّهْتُ خَالِدًا وَهُوَ يَجُودُ بِمَالِهِ بِٱلْبَحْرِ]{.ar}
    [@maani_nahw@ 3/131]{.citex}  
    "I likened [#xAlid]{.trn2}, while he (was) being generous with his wealth, with the sea."  
    (The [و]{.ar} in [وَهُوَ يَجُودُ]{.ar} is translated as "while." See section\ (ref).)

In the above example,
the prepositional phrase
[بِٱلبَحْرِ]{.ar} "with the sea"
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar} "to liken,"
not with the verb 
[يَجُودُ]{.ar} "to be generous."
Therefore, it is
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[بِٱلبَحْرِ]{.ar},
not
[يَجُودُ]{.ar}.

Similarly,
the prepositional phrase
[بِمَالِهِ]{.ar} "with his wealth"
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[يَجُودُ]{.ar} "to be generous,"
not with the verb
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar} "to liken."
Therefore, it is
[يَجُودُ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[بِمَالِهِ]{.ar},
not
[شَبَّهَ]{.ar}.

Here is another example:

(@ex000153) [ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/5/3@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/131]{.citex}  
    "This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion;"

In the above example,
the prepositional phrase
[مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar} "of your religion
is meaningfully connected to the verb
[يَئِسَ]{.ar} "to despair,"
not with the verb 
[كَفَرَ]{.ar} "to disbelieve"
Therefore, it is
[يَئِسَ]{.ar}
that governs
the preposition in
[مِنْ دِينِكُمْ]{.ar}
not
[كَفَرَ]{.ar}.^[@https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/5/3@]

## The combination of verbs with prepostions: the indirect ;maful;

In theory,
prepositions impart their own meanings.^[@kasher_intransitive_verb@ §2.7 124]
And there is no restriction on which prepositions may be used with a given governing verb (or verbal noun),
as long as the prepositional phrase be meaningfully connected with its governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/161]

The following examples show a possible set of prepositions that are meaningfully governed by the verb
[ٱنْصَرَفَ]{.ar} "to turn around, leave":

(@ex000154) [ٱنْصَرَفَ إِلَىٰ مَصْنَعِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/161]{.citex}  
    "He left to his workplace."

(@ex000155) [ٱنْصَرَفَ مِنَ ٱلْمَصْنَعِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/161]{.citex}  
    "He left from the workplace to his house."

(@ex000156) [ٱنْصَرَفَ ٱلْعَالِمُ عَنِ ٱلْهَزْلِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/161]{.citex}^[See also [لَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمَ أُحُدٍ انْهَزَمَ النَّاسُ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم]{.ar} [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4064@]{.citex}]  
    "The scholar left off joking."

(@ex000157) [ٱنْصَرَفَ فِي سَيَّارَتِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 2/161]{.citex}  
    "He left in his caravan."

Having said that,
in practice,
certain verbs are more meaningfully connected with certain prepositions, sometimes almost to the exclusion of others.^[@kasher_intransitive_verb@ §3.3]
For example, the verb
[أَقْسَمَ]{.ar} "to swear"
requires the preposition [بِ]{.ar} in order to transit to what is being sworn by.^[@kasher_intransitive_verb@ §3.3 129 citing [ابن الأنباري]{.ar}]
For example,

(@ex000158) [أقسم بالله]{.ar}
    [@anbari_asrar@ 203]{.citex}  
    "I swear by [#allAh]{.trn2}"

The combination of a verb and its governed preposition can even acquire a specific meaning.
Consider, for example, the verb
[وَجَدَ]{.ar}.
It's basic meaning is "to find."
It may be used with prepositions like
[بِ]{.ar},
[عَلَىٰ]{.ar},
[فِي]{.ar}
with this basic meaning.
For example:

(@ex000159) [وَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِجَهْدٍ]{.ar}  
    "I found the book with effort."

(@ex000160) [وَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
    "I found the book in the house."

(@ex000161) [وَجَدْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ عَلَى ٱلْخِزَانَةِ]{.ar}  
    "I found the book on the cupboard."

But this verb also has specific meanings when used with these prepositions and certain indirect ;maful;s
(albeit possibly with different ;masdar;s).
For example:

(@ex000162) [وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}
    [Lane: root [وجد]{.ar}]{.citex}  
    "He was angry with him."

(@ex000163) [وَجَدَ بِهَا]{.ar}
    [Lane: root [وجد]{.ar}]{.citex}  
    "He loved her."

(@ex000164) [قَدْ وَجَدَ فِي نَفْسِهِ عَلَىَّ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:1649b@]{.citex}  
    "he may have some feelings against me"

In such cases, the preposition almost seems to lose some of its independent meaning.
Instead, the meaning of the expression is obtained from the combination of the verb with the prepostion.

## The implication of general beingness

Consider the sentence:

(@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
    [@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/211]{.citex}  
    "Zayd is in the house."

We mentioned in section\ (ref) above,
that the governor of a preposition must be a verb, or what has the effect of a verb.
But we find no such word in the sentence above.
So what then is the governor of the preposition [فِي]{.ar}?

In order to remain consistent with the Arabic grammatical model,
we _implicate_ the involvement of an implied governor.
This implied governor has the meaning given by the verb "is" or its verbal noun "being".
We will refer to it as _general beingness_.

In Arabic grammatical terminology,
general beingness is represented by the verb
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar}
or its ;ism_fail;
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar},
or by the word
[كَائِن]{.ar},
which is the ;ism_fail; of the verb
[كَانَ]{.ar}.

Using these representations of general beingness,
we can explicate
(one interpretation of)
example (@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar} as:

(@sentence-zayd-in-house-explicit) [زَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ] فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is [being] in the house."

The word "being" is not really needed in the translation because the verb "is" conveys the same concept.
But we have added it to explicate the involvement of general beingness in the grammar of the sentence.

Note that
implicating general beingness in a sentence 
as we did in example (@sentence-zayd-in-house-explicit) above
is not same as if the words
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar} "to settle",
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar} "settled",
or
[كَائِن]{.ar} "being"
were actually expressed.
When expressed, they impart their own meaning.
For example

(@ex000165) [زَيْدٌ مُسْتَقِرٌّ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is settled in the house."

When implicating general beingness we only use the words
[ٱسْتَقَرَّ]{.ar},
[مُسْتَقِرّ]{.ar},
and
[كَائِن]{.ar}
terminologically.
In fact, according to the prevalent opinion among the grammarians,
general beingness can only be implied.^[@nahw_wafi@ 1/477]
If one of these (or any other) words is actually expressed,
then it will impart a specific meaning, not the meaning of general beingness.
Having said that, some grammarians did permit general beingness to be expressed.^[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/211 footnote]

## Implied general beingness as the ;xabar; of a sentence

The implication of generall beingness in the sentence
in example (@sentence-zayd-in-house) [زَيْدٌ فِي ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
solves another problem for us.
Remember how we said that, in the Arabic grammatical model,
the preposition is a ;fadlah; element.
So if we remove it (and the following ;istate; noun [ٱلدَّار]{.ar}) from the sentence,
we should still be left with a complete sentence.
Let's try doing that:

(@ex000166) [زَيْدٌ [مُسْتَقِرٌّ]]{.ar}  
    "Zayd is [being]."

See how the implied general beingness serves as the ;3umdah; ;musnad;: the ;xabar;.
If we were to not implicate general beingness, we would be left with a grammatically incomplete sentence.

We also take this opportunity to explain an apparent inconsistency.
Back in chapter\ (ref),
we had said that a prepositional phrase can be the ;xabar; of a sentence.
We now state that, strictly speaking, it is the (implied) governor of the prepostion which is the ;xabar;.
But because the actual ;xabar; is implied and is not expressed, we can say, loosely speaking,
that the prepositional phrase is the ;xabar;.

This approach of applying a terminological label differently when loosely speaking vs when strictly speaking is common.^[@nahw_wafi@ 1/215, 2/118, 2/442]
We will see other examples of it in sections\ (refs) ;ia;.

## Other implied governors besides general beingness

While general beingness is necessarily implied and never expressed (see section\ (ref) above),
other governors of prepositions too may be optionally suppressed.
This is done on the condition that that the overall meaning or context supplies the meaning of the suppressed governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/447 footnote]
For example:

(@ex000167) [ٱلْحُرُّ بٱلْحُرِّ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/178@ cited by @nahw_wafi@ 2/447]{.citex}  
    "the free for the free"

In the above example,
the ;xabar; has been analyzed as the implied governor
[يَقْتَصُّ]{.ar} "is retributed against"
or
[يُقْتَلُ]{.ar} "is killed".
So the sentence with the implicated meaning is 
[الحُرُّ يَقْتَصُّ أوْ يُقْتَلُ بِالحُرِّ]{.ar}
"the free is retributed against, or killed, for the free."^[@https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/2/178@]

## The prepositional phrase as a ;na3t;

Consider the sentence

(@sentence-prep-phrase-na3t) [رأيتُ طائرًا على الغصن]{.ar}
    [@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]{.citex}  
    "I saw a bird on the branch."

Now the logical assumption is that the bird was on the branch, not that my act of seeing was done on a branch.
So this means that the preposition [عَلَىٰ]{.ar} is not meaningfully connected with the verb [رَأَىٰ]{.ar}.
Therefore, [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} is not the governor of the preposition [عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.^[@ali_hani_ta3alluq@]
So what then is governing the preposition [عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.

Here again, we implicate the governor of general beingness, as if to say:

(@ex000168) [رأيتُ طائرًا [مُسْتَقِرًّا] على الغصن]{.ar}  
    "I saw a bird [being] on the branch."

General beingness
[[مُسْتَقِرًّا]]{.ar}
is implicated as the governor of
the preposition [عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.
The implicated general beingness is also a ;na3t; to the ;mafulb; 
[طَائِرًا]{.ar}.
But because 
the implied general beingness is not expressed, we may say, loosely speaking,
that the prepositional phrase is the ;na3t;.

In order for a prepositional phrase to be a ;na3t;,
its ;manut; will usually be an indefinite noun,
like 
[طَائِرًا]{.ar}
is in example (@sentence-prep-phrase-na3t) above.
In the case where the prepositional phrase occurs after a definite noun,
(like in [رأيتُ ٱلطائر على الغصن]{.ar})
it will typically be analyzed as a ;hal;.
We will discuss this in more detail in chapter\ (ref) section\ (ref) ;ia;.

Here are some more examples of prepositional phrases as ;na3t;s:

<!--
(@ex000169) [لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/9/128@]{.citex}  
    "There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves."  
    ([مِنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;^[])
-->

(@ex000170) [كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/265@]{.citex}  
    "like a garden on high ground"  
    ([بِرَبْوَةٍ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/2/265@])

(@ex000171) [رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِیهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْمْهُ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/2/129@]{.citex}  
    "Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves"  
    ([مِنْهُمْ]{.ar} is analyzed as a ;na3t;.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/2/129@])

<!--
(@ex000172) [وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/43/31@]{.citex}  
    And they said, "Why was this Qur’ān not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?"  
-->


When a prepositional phrase is, loosely speaking, a ;na3t;,
its governor is typically the implicated general beingness.^[@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 2/285, @ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/213].
<!--
In fact, some grammarians insist that the implied governor can only be general beingness.^[@https://tafsir.app/albahr-almuheet/3/194@ ([مَا وَعَدْتَنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ]{.ar})]
-->
However, it is conceivable that the implied governor of the preposition be interpreted, if not formally then at least in meaning, as some other verb (or verbal noun).^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/447 footnote]
For example:

(@sentence-quran-27-12) [فِی تِسْعِ ءَایَاتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/27/12@]{.citex}  
    "[These are] among the nine signs [you will take] to Pharaoh and his people."

In one interpretation of the above [Ayah]{.trn2},
the 
prepositional phrase
[إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ]{.ar}
"to Pharoah"
has been analyzed as ;na3t; of
[ءَایَاتٍ]{.ar}
"signs".
The meaning with the implicated governor has been explained as
[وَاصِلَةٌ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ]{.ar}
"_arriving_ to Pharoah".^[@3akbari_tibyan@ 2/1005. But see also @https://tafsir.app/aldur-almasoon/27/12@ where this interpretation is critiqued.]

Here is another example:

(@sentence-quran-9-125) [فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/9/125@]{.citex}  
    "it has [only] increased them in evil [in addition] to their evil"

In the above [Ayah]{.trn2},
the 
prepositional phrase
[إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ]{.ar}
"to their evil"
has been analyzed as ;na3t; of
[رِجْسًا]{.ar}
"evil".
The meaning with the implicated governor has been explained as
[كُفْرًاً مَضْمُومًا إِلَىٰ كُفْرِهِمْ]{.ar}
"in disbelief _in addition_ to their disbelief."^[@https://tafsir.app/kashaf/9/125@]

## The prepositional phrase in other functions

Besides the ;xabar; and the ;na3t; a prepositional phrase may also occur as a ;hal; and a ;silah;.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/441--442]
We will cover these two remaining topics in their respective chapters in sections\ (ref) and (ref) respectively.

## Word-order of the governor and its governee

By default, the governor will precede its governee.
For example:

(@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}."

In example (@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr) above,
the governing verb
[ضَرَبَ]{.ar}
precedes its governees:
the ;faa3il;
[زَيْدٌ]{.ar},
and the ;mafulb;
[عَمْرًا]{.ar}.

However, this order is often varied in order to convey a desired meaning.
For example:

(@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr-object-first) [عَمْرًا ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat _[#eamr]{.trn2}_."

In example (@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr-object-first) above,
the ;mafulb;
[عَمْرًا]{.ar}
has been placed before its governor
[ضَرَبَ]{.ar},
possibly to emphasize it.

This varying of the order of the words of the sentence is subject to certain rules, depending on:

* the type of the governor (whether it is a verb, or a verbal noun, etc.)
* the type of the governee (whether it is a preposition, or an adverb, etc.)
* the desired meaning of the expression.

We will discuss
the word-order rules for some governees here.
For new types of governees, we will discuss their word-order in their respective chapters, ;ia;.
And we will discuss sentence word-order generally in chapter\ (ref) ;ia;.

## Word order of the preposition and its governor

<!--
As a general tendency, a governor will typically precede its governee(s) in sentence word order.
This is rule is more strict for some governor-governee relationships than for others.
-->
A prepositional phrase may freely precede its governor.^[@nahw_wafi@ 2/444A]
This may be done for a number of purposes:

##### To limit and particularize the effect of the governor to the noun following the preposition.^[@maani_nahw@ 3/121] {.unnumbered}

For example:

(@ex000176) [وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2790@]{.citex}  
    "and from it originate the rivers of Paradise"

(@ex000177) [وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/3/122@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/121]{.citex}  
    "and upon Allāh the believers should rely."  

##### For drawing attention to the noun following the preposition^[@maani_nahw@ 3/121] {.unnumbered}

(@ex000178) [وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/3/180@ cited by @maani_nahw@ 3/123]{.citex}  
    "And Allāh, of what you do, is [fully] Aware."

(@ex000179) [أَلِهَـٰذَا جَمَعْتَنَا]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4770@]{.citex}  
    "Is it for _this_ (that) you have gathered us?"

(@ex000180) [وَبِٱلْأَسْحَارِ هُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://quran.com/51/18@]{.citex}  
    "And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness"  
    (The prepositional phrase [بِٱلْأَسْحَارِ]{.ar} is placed not just before its governor in the ;xabar; [يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ]{.ar}, but also before the ;mubtada; [هُمْ]{.ar}.)


When governing the preposition (and also the adverbs of time and place (section\ ref)),
the placement of the governee is especially flexible.^[@radiy_kafiyah@ 1/289D--290A]
Even when the placement of the governees of a governor might be restricted in general,
a license is often given to prepositions.
For example, we saw in section\ (ref), that when a ;ism_fail; is prefixed with [ال]{.ar}, then its governees may not precede it.
So for example, we cannot say
;x; [هذا زيدا الضارب]{.ar}.
We have to say instead
;v; [هذا الضارب زيدا]{.ar}.
But an exception is made for the preposition which is governed by the ;ism_fail;.
So we can say:

(@ex000181) [أنا لك المرافق]{.ar}
    [@nahw_wafi@ 3/263]{.citex}  
    [I am, for you, the travelling companion.]{.trans}


We will see, in sections\ (refs) ;ia; that the governee, in this case,
are permitted to be placed where other types of governees are not.

TODO: Add content to:

* [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters: ibn_aqil 1/278 fn; 1/349
* [كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters [كان زيد آكلا طعامك]{.ar}
* [#HijAzi]{.trn2} [مَا]{.ar}:  sharh uthaymeen 22/4 ([مكا بي أنت معينا]{.ar})

<!--
When the prepositional phrase (and adverb of time and place) is governed by the ;xabar;
of a ;j_ism;,
then
the prepositional phrase may even precede the ;mubtada;.
For example,


It is rare, or even impermissible, for other types of governees of the ;xabar; to precede the ;mubtada;.
(See the discussion on (@some-ref) [عمرا زيد ضرب]{.ar} in section\ (ref).)

In fact, when the governor of the prepositional phrase (and adverb of time and place) is the ;xabar;
of [إِنَّ]{.ar} (or its sisters),
or of [كَانَ]{.ar} (or its sisters),
or of the [#HijAzi]{.trn2} [مَا]{.ar},
even
then may the prepositional phrase be placed before the subject.
This latitude is expressly granted only to prepositional phrases and adverbs of time and place,
and not to other types of governees.
Examples:
-->

### Word-order of the ;mafulb; and its governor

Consider example (@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr) again:

(@sentence-zayd-beat-3amr) [ضَرَبَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا]{.ar}  
    "Zayd beat [#eamr]{.trn2}."

There are six possible permutations of word-order of the above example.

...

(@ex000182) [عمرا زيد ضرب]{.ar}

In examples ... the ;maful; [عمرا]{.ar} precedes its governor [ضرب]{.ar}.
This is generally permitted for stylistic (?) aspects, as we will discuss in chapter (ref).

Lets consider exaple ... in more detail.
This is because the ;maful; is governed by ضرب in the ;xabar;. 
But it precedes, not just its ;3aamil; but also the ;mubtada; of the outer sentence.
This is normal for some types of governees (like the prep).
But for the mafulb some grammarians consider it impermissible.
Others allow it, but consider it rare or weak in its structure.


@peled_sentence_types@ considers this dubious or unattested. Search for OSV in the text. However, others consider it permissible (search sabban, batalyusi for this sentence).
