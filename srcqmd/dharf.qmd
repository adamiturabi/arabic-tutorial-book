# The adverb of time and place

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

"Zayd went to the market one day."

The term "one day" here is an _adverb of time_.
It describes the verb "went" and tells us the time in which the action of going ocurred.

In this chapter, we will study two kinds of adverbs in Arabic:
the _adverb of time_ and the _adverb of place_.
These two adverbs are treated together because they both describe the space (of time and place, respectedly) in which the action of a verb ocurrs.
There are other kinds of adverbs as well, and we will study them in other chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The adverb, in Arabic, is a noun that qualifies a verb.
It is put in the a-state.
Let's express the above sentence in Arabic:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  

The noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is functioning as an adverb of time.
When used thus, as an adverb, we can translate it idiomatically as "one day" instead of "a day".

## Determining when a noun is an adverb of time or place

The term _adverb_ in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns.
Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs.
For example, the noun
[يَوْم]{.ar}
doesn't necessarily need to be used as an adverb.
It may be used, for example, as the topic of a sentence:

[ٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
"The day is long."

Even when it is in the a-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. 
Here it is as a direct doee:

[أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.]{.ar}  
"I wait for an easy day."

The way that we can tell when a noun is an adevrb of time or place is if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. The noun is in the a-state.
2. The noun is extra, such that the sentence is complete, albeit more vague, without it.
3. The noun signifies the time or place in which the verb occurred.

In the sentence [أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا]{.ar}, the noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is not signify the time in which the verb [أَنْتَظِرُ]{.ar} is ocurring.
So it is not an adverb of time.

Having said that, there are nouns that are used exclusively or mostly as adverbs, like [قَبْل]{.ar} "before".
So, loosely speaking, such nouns, themselves, may be referred to as adverbs.

## The adverb or time

The adverb of time is more unrestricted than the adverb of place.
So we will deal with it first.
We have already seen an example of an adverb of time in the sentence:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  
"Zayd went to the market one day."

In the above example, the adverb of time [يَوْم]{.ar} is singular and indefinite.
But an adverb of time can occur in other formations as well. For example:

As a definite common noun:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ ٱلْيَوْمَ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd went to the market today."  
([ٱلْيَوْم]{.ar} "the day" is also used to mean "today".)
