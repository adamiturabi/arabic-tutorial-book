# The adverb of time and place

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

"Zayd went to the market one day."

The term "one day" here is an _adverb of time_.
It describes the verb "went" and tells us the time in which the action of going ocurred.

In this chapter, we will study two kinds of adverbs in Arabic:
the _adverb of time_ and the _adverb of place_.
These two adverbs are treated together because they both describe the space (of time and place, respectedly) in which the action of a verb ocurrs.
There are other kinds of adverbs as well, and we will study them in other chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The adverb, in Arabic, is a noun that qualifies a verb.
It is put in the a-state.
Let's express the above sentence in Arabic:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  

The noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is functioning as an adverb of time.
When used thus, as an adverb, we can translate it idiomatically as "one day" instead of "a day".

## Determining when a noun is an adverb of time or place

The term _adverb_ in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns.
Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs.
For example, the noun
[يَوْم]{.ar}
doesn't necessarily need to be used as an adverb.
It may be used, for example, as the topic of a sentence:

[ٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
"The day is long."

Even when it is in the a-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. 
Here it is as a direct doee:

[أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.]{.ar}  
"I wait for an easy day."

The way that we can tell when a noun is an adevrb of time or place is if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. The noun is in the a-state.
2. The noun is extra, such that the sentence is complete, albeit more vague, without it.
3. The noun signifies the time or place in which the verb occurred.

In the sentence [أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا]{.ar}, the noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is not signify the time in which the verb [أَنْتَظِرُ]{.ar} is ocurring.
So it is not an adverb of time.

Having said that, there are nouns that are used exclusively or mostly as adverbs, like [قَبْل]{.ar} "before".
So, loosely speaking, such nouns, themselves, may be referred to as adverbs.

## The adverb or time

The adverb of time is more unrestricted than the adverb of place.
So we will deal with it first.
We have already seen an example of an adverb of time in the sentence:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  
"Zayd went to the market one day."

In the above example, the adverb of time [يَوْم]{.ar} is singular and indefinite.
But an adverb of time can occur in other formations as well. For example:

As a definite common noun:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ ٱلْيَوْمَ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd went to the market today."  
([ٱلْيَوْم]{.ar} "the day" is also used to mean "today".)

With a describer:

[قَتَلْتُهُ ٱلسَّنَةَ ٱلْمَاضِيَةَ.]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol. ii, §44, p. 110A]  
"I killed him last year."

As a proper noun:

[صُمْتُ رَمَضَانَ.]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol. ii, §44, p. 110A]  
"I fasted (the month of) [#ramaDAn]{.trn2}."

As an annexe noun to a base noun:

[جِئْتُ زَمَنَ ٱلشِّتَاءِ.]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol. ii, §44, p. 110A]  
"I came in the winter-time."

As an annexe noun to a sentence:

[صَحَبْتُ صَدِيقِي يَوْمَ خَرَجْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ.]{.ar}  
"I accompanied my friend the day we left the city."

As a dual or plural:

[تَأَمَّلْ شَهْرَيْنِ فِي ٱخْتِيَارِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذِ.]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol. ii, §44, p. 109D]  
"Reflect two months upon the choice of a teacher."

[سَكَنَ فِي بَعْضِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَيَّامًا.]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol. ii, §44, p. 109D]  
"He stayed in one of the villages (a few) days."

The adverb before its verb in sentence word order^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/245]:

[ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ]{.ar}
^[<https://quran.com/5:3>]  
"This day I have perfected for you your religion"

## The adverb of place

The adverb of place is more restricted than the adverb of time.
Only some nouns are suitable to function as adverbs of place.
Such nouns fall under some categories that we will discuss in the next few subsections:

### Vague and unbounded nouns

Generally, only vague and unbounded nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place.
A noun that denotes a specific place are not permitted.
So, for example, we can't use the noun [بَيْت]{.ar} as an adverb of place to say [جَلَسْتُ بَيْتًا]{.ar}.
Instead we'll have to use the preposition [فِي]{.ar} and say [جَلَسْتُ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}.

Directional nouns are considered vague enough to be used as adverbs of place.
Such nouns include:

+ [أَمَام]{.ar}, [قُدَّام]{.ar} "in front (of)"
+ [خَلْفَ]{.ar}, [وَرَاء]{.ar} "behind"
+ [فَوْق]{.ar} "above"
+ [تَحْت]{.ar} "under"
+ [يَمِين]{.ar} "right"
+ [شِمَال]{.ar}, [يَسَار]{.ar} "left"

Permitted also are general spatial nouns like:

+ [وَسْط]{.ar} "in the middle (of)"
+ [حَوْل]{.ar} "around"
+ [عِنْد]{.ar}, [لَدُنْ]{.ar}, [لَدَىٰ]{.ar} "at, with, by"
+ [مَع]{.ar} "with"
+ [بَيْن]{.ar} "between"

Some of the nouns above we have introduced previously in section (ref) as _pseudo-prepositions_.
But they are actually nouns, that when used as adverbs give meanings similar to prepositions.

<!--
These nouns can be used when indefinite. 
-->
Here is an example of the use of these nouns as adverbs of place:

[نَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَيَسَارًا (وَشِمَالًا)]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol.\ ii., §44,\ p.\ 111B]  
"He looked right and left."

<!--But they are more likely to be used as annexe nouns.-->
These nouns can be, and often are, annexe nouns.
When they are annexed to a definite noun then they too will be definite.
But this in no way restricts their vagueness and thus ability to be used as adverbs of place.
For example,

[بَايَعْنَا النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ]{.ar}
^[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7208>]  
"We gave the oath of allegiance to the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt} under the tree"

There are some nouns whose meaning is associated with the word "side":

+ [جَانِب]{.ar}, [نَاحِيَة]{.ar}, [وَجْه]{.ar}, [جِهَة]{.ar} "side"
+ [دَاخِل]{.ar}, [جَوْف]{.ar} "inside"
+ [خَارِج]{.ar} "outside"

With these nouns, it is more common to use the preposition [فِي]{.ar} before them.
For example,

[نِمْتُ فِي خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
^[Wright, vol.\ ii., §44,\ p.\ 112A]  
"I slept outside the house."

But they may be used, less commonly, as adverbs of place as well.
For example,

[أَتَشَوَّفُ دَاخِلًا وَخَارِجًا]{.ar}
^[[[مسند أحمد]{.ar}:6520](https://shamela.ws/book/25794/4962#p1)]  
"I (was) looking inside and outside."

[فَهُوَ مُتَّكِئٌ عَلَيْهَا دَاخِلَ الْمَسْجِدِ]{.ar}
^[[[مسند أحمد]{.ar}:15837](https://shamela.ws/book/25794/12210)]  
"And he (was) relying on [our arms] inside the mosque"

<!--
Universal directions like
[شَرْق]{.ar} "east"
and
[غَرْب]{.ar} "west"
too are sometimes used as adverbs of place.
The nouns [بَرّ]{.ar} "land" and [بَحْر]{.ar} "sea" also seem to be used as adverbs of place.
For such nouns, it seems more correct that they only be used as such when indefinite.
For example,

:::{.ar}
وَتَقَرَّبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى بِاتِّبَاعِهِمْ سُنَنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، وَطَلَبِهِمْ لِآثَارِهِ وَأَخْبَارِهِ، بَرًّا وَبَحْرًا وَشَرْقًا وَغَرْبًا
:::
^[[تأويل مختلف الحديث لابن قتيبة]{.ar}, p.\ 127]  
"And they sought to come close to [#allAh]{.trn2} by following the practices of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} [ﷺ]{.aralt} and by seeking reports and information of him, (by) land and (by) sea, and east and west."
-->

Excluded from this restriction of vagueness are nouns used with the verbs [دَخَلَ]{.ar} "to enter", [سَكَنَ]{.ar} "to dwell", and [نَزَلَ]{.ar} "to alight".^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/253]
So we can say
[دَخَلْتُ ٱلدَّارَ]{.ar}
"I entered the house,"
[سَكَنْتُ ٱلْبَيْتَ]{.ar}
"I dwelled (in) the house,"
and
[نَزَلْتُ ٱلْبَلَدَ]{.ar}
"I alighted (in) the country."
The a-state nouns with these verbs may be considered either direct doees or adverbs of place.
Excluded also, is the country name [ٱلشَّأْم]{.ar} "Syria" with the verb [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} "to go." So we can say [ذَهَبْتُ ٱلشَّأْمَ]{.ar} for "I went (to) Syria."
