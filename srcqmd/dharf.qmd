# The adverb of time and place

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

"Zayd went to the market one day."

The term "one day" here is an _adverb of time_.
It describes the verb "went" and tells us the time in which the action of going ocurred.

In this chapter, we will study two kinds of adverbs in Arabic:
the _adverb of time_ and the _adverb of place_.
These two adverbs are treated together because they both describe the space (of time and place, respectedly) in which the action of a verb ocurrs.
There are other kinds of adverbs as well, and we will study them in other chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The adverb, in Arabic, is a noun that qualifies a verb.
It is put in the a-state.
Let's express the above sentence in Arabic:



(@) [ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}



The noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is functioning as an adverb of time.
When used thus, as an adverb, we can translate it idiomatically as "one day" instead of "a day".

## Determining when a noun is an adverb of time or place

The term _adverb_ in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns.
Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs.
For example, the noun
[يَوْم]{.ar}
doesn't necessarily need to be used as an adverb.
It may be used, for example, as the topic of a sentence:



(@) [ٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
    "The day is long."



Even when it is in the a-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. 
Here it is as a direct doee:



(@) [أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.]{.ar}  
    "I wait for an easy day."



The way that we can tell when a noun is an adevrb of time or place is if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. The noun is in the a-state.
2. The noun is extra, such that the sentence is complete, albeit more vague, without it.
3. The noun signifies the time or place in which the verb occurred.

In the sentence [أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا]{.ar}, the noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is not signify the time in which the verb [أَنْتَظِرُ]{.ar} is ocurring.
So it is not an adverb of time.

Having said that, there are nouns that are used exclusively or mostly as adverbs, like [قَبْل]{.ar} "before".
So, loosely speaking, such nouns, themselves, may be referred to as adverbs.

## The adverb or time

The adverb of time is more unrestricted than the adverb of place.
So we will deal with it first.
We have already seen an example of an adverb of time in the sentence:



(@) [ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  
    "Zayd went to the market one day."



In the above example, the adverb of time [يَوْم]{.ar} is singular and indefinite.
But an adverb of time can occur in other formations as well. For example:

As a definite common noun:



(@) [ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ ٱلْيَوْمَ.]{.ar}  
    "Zayd went to the market today."  
    ([ٱلْيَوْم]{.ar} "the day" is also used to mean "today".)



With a describer:



(@) [قَتَلْتُهُ ٱلسَّنَةَ ٱلْمَاضِيَةَ.]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 110A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I killed him last year."



As a proper noun:



(@) [صُمْتُ رَمَضَانَ.]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 110A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I fasted (the month of) [#ramaDAn]{.trn2}."





As an annexe noun to a base noun:



(@) [جِئْتُ زَمَنَ ٱلشِّتَاءِ.]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 110A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I came in the winter-time."



As an annexe noun to a sentence:



(@) [صَحَبْتُ صَدِيقِي يَوْمَ خَرَجْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ.]{.ar}  
    "I accompanied my friend the day we left the city."



As a dual or plural:



(@) [تَأَمَّلْ شَهْرَيْنِ فِي ٱخْتِيَارِ ٱلْأُسْتَاذِ.]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 109D]]{.ftsize}  
    "Reflect two months upon the choice of a teacher."





(@) [سَكَنَ فِي بَعْضِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَيَّامًا.]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 109D]]{.ftsize}  
    "He stayed in one of the villages (a few) days."



The adverb before its verb in sentence word order^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/245]:



(@) [ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ]{.ar}
    [[<https://quran.com/5:3>]]{.ftsize}  
    "This day I have perfected for you your religion"



## The adverb of place

The adverb of place is more restricted than the adverb of time.
Only some nouns are suitable to function as adverbs of place.
Such nouns fall under some categories that we will discuss in the next few subsections:

### Vague and unbounded nouns

Generally, only vague and unbounded nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place.
A noun that denotes a specific place are not permitted.
So, for example, we can't use the noun [بَيْت]{.ar} as an adverb of place to say [جَلَسْتُ بَيْتًا]{.ar}.
Instead we'll have to use the preposition [فِي]{.ar} and say [جَلَسْتُ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}.

Directional nouns are considered vague enough to be used as adverbs of place.
Such nouns include:

+ [أَمَام]{.ar}, [قُدَّام]{.ar} "in front (of)"
+ [خَلْفَ]{.ar}, [وَرَاء]{.ar} "behind"
+ [فَوْق]{.ar} "above"
+ [تَحْت]{.ar} "under"
+ [يَمِين]{.ar} "right"
+ [شِمَال]{.ar}, [يَسَار]{.ar} "left"

Permitted also are general spatial nouns like:

+ [وَسْط]{.ar} "in the middle (of)"
+ [حَوْل]{.ar} "around"
+ [عِنْد]{.ar}, [لَدُنْ]{.ar}, [لَدَىٰ]{.ar} "at, with, by"
+ [مَع]{.ar} "with"
+ [بَيْن]{.ar} "between"

Some of the nouns above we have introduced previously in section (ref) as _pseudo-prepositions_.
But they are actually nouns, that when used as adverbs give meanings similar to prepositions.

<!--
These nouns can be used when indefinite. 
-->
Here is an example of the use of these nouns as adverbs of place:



(@) [نَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَيَسَارًا (وَشِمَالًا)]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii., §44,\ p.\ 111B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He looked right and left."



<!--But they are more likely to be used as annexe nouns.-->
These nouns can be, and often are, annexe nouns.
When they are annexed to a definite noun then they too will be definite.
But this in no way restricts their vagueness and thus ability to be used as adverbs of place.^[[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} p.\ 184]
For example,

(@) [بَايَعْنَا النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ]{.ar}
    [[<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7208>]]{.ftsize}  
    "We gave the oath of allegiance to the Prophet [ﷺ]{.aralt} under the tree"

Ocassionally, instead of being an annexe noun, the adverb occurs as an indefinite noun and is qualified by the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} after it.
For example:

(@) [فَقَامَ أَسْفَلَ مِنْ ذَلِکَ عِنْدَ السَّرِیرِ]{.ar}
    [[[[مصنف ابن أبي شيبة - ت الحوت]{.ar} :11544](https://shamela.ws/book/9944/12868)]]{.ftsize}  
    "So he stood lower than that at the bed"  
    (Note how [أَسْفَل]{.ar} does not take [tanwIn]{.trn2} because it is a semi-flexible noun.

There are some nouns whose meaning is associated with the word "side":

+ [جَانِب]{.ar}, [نَاحِيَة]{.ar}, [وَجْه]{.ar}, [جِهَة]{.ar} "side"
+ [دَاخِل]{.ar}, [جَوْف]{.ar} "inside"
+ [خَارِج]{.ar} "outside"

With these nouns, it is more common to use prepositions like [فِي]{.ar}, [إلَىٰ]{.ar}, or [مِنْ]{.ar} before them.
For example,



(@) [نِمْتُ فِي خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii., §44,\ p.\ 112A]]{.ftsize}  
    "I slept outside the house."





(@) [زَيْدٌ فِي جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو.]{.ar}  
    or  
    [زَيْدٌ إِلَىٰ جَانِبِ عَمْرٍو.]{.ar}
    [[[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} p.\ 184]]{.ftsize}  
    "Zayd is beside [#eamr]{.trn2}"





(@) [زَيْدٌ مِنْ خَارِجِ ٱلدَّارِ.]{.ar}
    [[[شرح الرضي على الكافية]{.ar} p.\ 184]]{.ftsize}  
    "Zayd is outside the house."

But they may be used, less commonly, as adverbs of place as well.
For example,



(@) [أَتَشَوَّفُ دَاخِلًا وَخَارِجًا]{.ar}
    [[[[مسند أحمد]{.ar} :6520](https://shamela.ws/book/25794/4962#p1)]]{.ftsize}  
    "I (was) looking inside and outside."



(@) [فَهُوَ مُتَّكِئٌ عَلَيْهَا دَاخِلَ الْمَسْجِدِ]{.ar}
    [[[[مسند أحمد]{.ar} :15837](https://shamela.ws/book/25794/12210)]]{.ftsize}  
    "And he (was) relying on [our arms] inside the mosque"


<!--
Universal directions like
[شَرْق]{.ar} "east"
and
[غَرْب]{.ar} "west"
too are sometimes used as adverbs of place.
The nouns [بَرّ]{.ar} "land" and [بَحْر]{.ar} "sea" also seem to be used as adverbs of place.
For such nouns, it seems more correct that they only be used as such when indefinite.
For example,

:::{.ar}
وَتَقَرَّبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى بِاتِّبَاعِهِمْ سُنَنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، وَطَلَبِهِمْ لِآثَارِهِ وَأَخْبَارِهِ، بَرًّا وَبَحْرًا وَشَرْقًا وَغَرْبًا
:::
[[تأويل مختلف الحديث لابن قتيبة]{.ar}, p.\ 127]{.aside}  
"And they sought to come close to [#allAh]{.trn2} by following the practices of the Messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} [ﷺ]{.aralt} and by seeking reports and information of him, (by) land and (by) sea, and east and west."
-->

Some place nouns are vague in that they mean "place", like
[مَكَان]{.ar},
[مَوْضِع]{.ar},
and
[مَقَام]{.ar}.
These nouns are permitted to be used as adverbs of place when construed with a verb conveying the idea of stopping or remaining.
For example,

(@) [جَلَسْتُ مَكَانَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 111D]]{.ftsize}  
    "I sat down in Zayd's place."

The noun
[مَكَان]{.ar}
is also used in an annexation to mean "in place of". 
With this meaning, it may be used as an adverb of place unrestrictedly.
For example,

(@) [خُذْ هَـٰذَا مَكَانَ ذَ\ ٰلِكَ]{.ar}
    [[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/261]]{.ftsize}  
    "Take this in place of that."

So too may the noun [بَدَل]{.ar} "replacement" be used in this way.

(@) [خُذْ هَـٰذَا بَدَلَ ذَ\ ٰلِكَ]{.ar}
    [[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/261]]{.ftsize}  
    "Take this in replacement of that."

Excluded from this restriction of vagueness are nouns used with the verbs [دَخَلَ]{.ar} "to enter", [سَكَنَ]{.ar} "to dwell", and [نَزَلَ]{.ar} "to alight".^[[النحو الوافي]{.ar} 2/253]
So we can say
[دَخَلْتُ ٱلدَّارَ]{.ar}
"I entered the house,"
[سَكَنْتُ ٱلْبَيْتَ]{.ar}
"I dwelled (in) the house,"
and
[نَزَلْتُ ٱلْبَلَدَ]{.ar}
"I alighted (in) the country."
The a-state nouns with these verbs may be considered either direct doees or adverbs of place.
Excluded also, is the country name [ٱلشَّأْم]{.ar} "Syria" with the verb [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} "to go." So we can say [ذَهَبْتُ ٱلشَّأْمَ]{.ar} for "I went (to) Syria."

### Units of distance and space

Units of distance and space are permitted to be used as adverbs of place.
For example:

(@) [سَارُوا أَرْبَعَةَ أَمْيالٍ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 111B]]{.ftsize}  
    "They travelled four miles."

(@) [مَشَيْتُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 111B]]{.ftsize}  
    "I walked two parasangs."  
    (A [فَرْسَخْ]{.ar} is a unit of distance approximately equal to three miles.)

(@) [جَرَىٰ غَلْوَةً]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 111B]]{.ftsize}  
    "He ran (the distance of) a bowshot."

## The deputy adverb of time and place

The adverb of time or place 

### Nouns of place

In section\ (ref) we studied the _noun of place_, which is formed on the pattern [مَفْعِل]{.ar} or [مَفْعَل]{.ar}.
The noun of place is permitted to be used as an adverb of place, but only when construed with the verb from which it is derived.
For example,

(@) [قَعَدْتُ مَقْعَدَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar},  
    [جَلَسْتُ مَجْلِسَ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
    [[Wright, vol.\ ii, §44, p.\ 112A]]{.ftsize}  
    I sat down in Zayd's seat.


## [قَبْل]{.ar} and its sisters

There are a class of nouns,
which are usually adverbs of time and place,
that are sometimes flexible, and sometimes rigid.
These nouns are:

* [قَبْل]{.ar} "before"
* [بَعْد]{.ar} "after"
* [دُون]{.ar} "below", 
* [أَسْفَل]{.ar} "bottom"
* [فَوْق]{.ar} "above"
* [تَحْت]{.ar} "under"
* [أَمَام]{.ar}, [قُدَّام]{.ar} "in front"
* [خَلْف]{.ar}, [وَرَاء]{.ar} "behind"
* [عَلُ]{.ar}, [عَلْو]{.ar}, "high", "on top"
* [أَوَّل]{.ar} "first"

Also usually included with these are^[See [النحو الوافي]{.ar} 3/142, footnote\ 1 for references to the difference of opinion regarding them]:

* [يَمِين]{.ar} "right"
* [شِمَال]{.ar} "left"
* [آخِر]{.ar} "last"

Collectively, we will call them [قَبْل]{.ar} _and its sisters_.

We have already seen some of these being used used as adverbs of time or place.
The cases for determining when they are flexible and when rigid are as follows:

a. When used as annex nouns with a mentioned base noun: When used as annex nouns then 
   [قَبْل]{.ar} and its sisters
   are flexible.
   For example,

   (@) [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ ٱلْجَيْشِ]{.ar}  
       "The commander stood in front of the army"

    As we've previously discussed, instead of using these nouns as adverbs, it is common to also precede them with a preposition, like [مِنْ]{.ar}.
    For example:

   (@) [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ ٱلْجَيْشِ]{.ar}  
       "The commander stood in front of the army"

   In this case, whether 
   [قَبْل]{.ar} or one of its sisters
   is an adverb in the a-state, or following a preposition in the i-state, then it is flexible.
   This is indicated in the examples above by the [fatHah]{.trn2} on its ending when in the a-state,
   and the [kasrah]{.trn2} when in the i-state.


b. When used as annex nouns but the base noun is not mentioned:
   Rarely, for stylistic reasons, the base noun in sentences like the example above is dropped.
   But the presence of the base noun is intended by the speaker.
   In such cases, the annexe noun will be flexible and without [tanwIn]{.trn2}.
   For example:

   (@) [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامَ]{.ar}  
       [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامِ]{.ar}  
       "The commander stood in front [of the army]"

c. More commonly, the base noun is deleted, both in expression and in intention,
   but the adverb is still understood to be bounded implicitly.
   In this case,
   [قَبْل]{.ar} and its sisters
   will be rigid.
   Their ending will have a [Dammah]{.trn2} regardless of whether they are in the a-state (as an adverb) or in the i-state (following [مِنْ]{.ar}).
   For example:

   (@) [قَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامُ]{.ar}  
       [قَدِمَ ٱلْجَيْشُ وَقَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامُ]{.ar}  
       "The army arrived, and the commander stood in front (of the army)"

   This usage is quite common. Much more so than case b. where the base noun is dropped only stylistically.

d. Lastly,
   [قَبْل]{.ar} and its sisters
   may occur as indefinite nouns
   without an implicit or explicit base noun.
   They then have an absolute and unbounded meaning.
   In this case, they
   are flexible. <!-- and will have [tanwIn]{.trn2}.-->
   For example,

   (@) [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ أَمَامًا]{.ar}  
       [قَامَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ مِنْ أَمَامٍ]{.ar}  
       "The commander stood in front"

   In the example above, we can see that [أَمًام]{.ar} is a flexible noun due to its [tanwIn]{.trn2}.
   The rest of 
   [قَبْل]{.ar} and its sisters
   will be similar in behavior, except for
   [أَسْفَل]{.ar},
   which is a semi-flexible noun due to its pattern, and will therefore not take [tanwIn]{.trn2}.
   It will be [أَسْفَلَ]{.ar} both, when an adverb in the a-state, and in the i-state when preceded by [مِنْ]{.ar}.

The difference in meaning between some of these cases is quite subtle.
In practice, cases a. and c. are more common.
And case b. is rare.

Here are some more examples:

(@) [يُخْرِجُ غِلْمَانَهُ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَلَا يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ ذِي الْحُلَيْفَةِ، يُحْرِمُونَ مِنْ أَمَامِ ذَلِكَ]{.ar}
    [[[[مصنف ابن أبي شيبة - ت الحوت]{.ar} :14178](https://shamela.ws/book/9944/15870)]]{.ftsize}  
    "He would take his (slave) boys out for the [#Hajj]{.trn2}. But they would not enter [iHrAm]{.trn2} from [#pu l-#Hulayfah]{.trn2}; they would enter [iHrAm]{.trn2} from before that [location]."

(@) [إِذْ جَاءُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ]{.ar}[[<https://quran.com/33:10>]]{.ftsize}  
    "[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you"

The word [أَوَّل]{.ar} has some rules that are specific to it and we will treat it separately in section\ (ref).

## Some commonly used adverbs of time and place

### [أَوَّل]{.ar}

### [أَسْفَل]{.ar}

* does it get tanwin?

### [بَعْد]{.ar}

* used for time and place
* meaning "yet"

### [ذَات]{.ar}
