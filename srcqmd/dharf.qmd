# The adverb of time and place

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

"Zayd went to the market one day."

The term "one day" here is an _adverb of time_.
It describes the verb "went" and tells us the time in which the action of going ocurred.

In this chapter, we will study two kinds of adverbs in Arabic:
the _adverb of time_ and the _adverb of place_.
These two adverbs are treated together because they both describe the space (of time and place, respectedly) in which the action of a verb ocurrs.
There are other kinds of adverbs as well, and we will study them in other chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

The adverb, in Arabic, is a noun that qualifies a verb.
It is put in the a-state.
Let's express the above sentence in Arabic:

[ذَهَبَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلسُّوقِ يَوْمًا.]{.ar}  

The noun [يَوْم]{.ar} is functioning as an adverb of time.
When used thus, as an adverb, we can translate it idiomatically as "one day" instead of "a day".

## Determining the adverb of time or place

The term _adverb_ in Arabic grammar technically does not refer to any specific class of nouns.
Generally, nouns can be used for different functions, including as adverbs.
For example, the noun
[يَوْم]{.ar}
doesn't necessarily need to be used as an adverb.
It may be used, for example, as the topic of a sentence:

[ٱَلْيَوْمُ طَوِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
"The day is long."

Even when it is in the a-state, it is not necessarily an adverb. 
Here it is as a direct doee:

[أَنْتَظِرُ يَوْمًا سَهْلًا.]{.ar}  
"I wait for an easy day."
