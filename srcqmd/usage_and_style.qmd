# Usage and style

## "There is a ..." sentences.

In English the plain existence of an indefinite subject is expressed using the word "there". For example:

i.   "There is a gloom in the house"
ii.  "There is a type of anger which is liked and [there is] a type of anger which is disliked.
iii. "There are reasons."
iv.  "There is a god."
v.   "Is there food?"
vi.  "Yes, there is food"

The word "there" in these examples does not indicate a specific place. Rather it signifies the existence of the subject of the sentence. 
This use of "there" is called the _existential_ "there".

<!--As if to say:

i.   "A gloom exists in the house."
ii.  "A type of confidence exists which is good and a type of confidence exists which is bad.
iii. "Reasons exist"
iv.  "A god exists."
-->

Expressing such sentences in Arabic can sometimes be tricky.
There is a modern tendency to use the [Parf makan]{.trn2} [هُنَاكَ]{.ar} and the [majhUl]{.trn2} verb [يُوجَدُ]{.ar}. <!-- as direct equivalents of the English "there" and "exists".-->
So one might find:

i.   [هُنَاكَ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ.]{.ar} or  
     [يُوجَدُ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ.]{.ar}
ii.  [هناك غضب يستحب وهناك غصب يكره.]{.ar}  or  
     [يوجد غضب يستحب ويوجد غصب يكره.]{.ar}
iii. [هُناك أسباب.]{.ar} or  
     [تُوجَدُ أسباب.]{.ar}  
iv.  [هناك إله.]{.ar} or  
     [يوجد إله.]{.ar}
v.   [هَل هناك طعام؟]{.ar} or  
     [هل يوجد طعام؟]{.ar}
v.   [نَعَمْ هناك طعام.]{.ar} or  
     [نَعَمْ يوجد طعام.]{.ar}

Sometimes in place of [هُنَاكَ]{.ar}, its synonym, [ثَمَّةَ]{.ar} is used.
These usages of [هُنَاكَ]{.ar}, [ثَمَّةَ]{.ar}, and [يُوجَدُ]{.ar} are foreign to Arabic and should generally be avoided.

In Classical Arabic, expressing such sentences falls under the category of sentences with indefinite subjects.
We have discussed this topic in chapter\ \@ref(chap-indef-subjects).

There are various strategies for expressing such sentences:

If, for example, there is a [jArr wa-majrUr]{.trn2}, or other [cibh jumlah]{.trn2} then it can readily be used as a [xabar]{.trn2} that precedes the [mubtadaE]{.trn2}. For example:

[فِي ٱلْبَيتِ حَزَنٌ.]{.ar}  
"In the house is gloom."

Sometimes, a [jArr wa-majrUr]{.trn2}, or other [cibh jumlah]{.trn2} is not original, but can readily be manufactured. 
For example, in the sentence, "There are reasons." the reasons must be for something, and that something can be used as a [xabar]{.trn2}:

[لِلْوَضْعِ أَسْبَابٌ.]{.ar}  
"For the situation, are reasons."

Similarly, a introductory sentence or [cibh jumlah]{.trn2} can be manufactured to pave the way for the main sentence. For example:

[الغَضَبُ غَضَبَانِ: غَضَبٌ مُسْتَحَبٌّ وَغَضَبٌ مَكْرُوهٌ.]{.ar}  
"Anger is (actually) two angers: an anger that is liked, and an anger that is disliked."

[مَنَ ٱلْغَضَبِ مَا يٌسْتَحَبُّ وَمَا يٌكْرَهُ.]{.ar}  
"From anger is that which is liked, that which is disliked."

Sometimes it hard to come up with any of the above solutions, as in the sentence: "There is a god."
Such sentences, if they are able to be converted to an interjection, may be expressed with the subject itself as a one word sentence:

[إِلَـٰهٌ!]{.ar}  
"[There is] a god!"

This solution should only be considered if the sentence makes sense as an interjection, and can not be used as a blanket solution. For example, in the exchange:

"Is there food?"  
"Yes, there is food."

One way to express this in Arabic is:

[هَلْ مِنْ طَعَامٍ؟]{.ar}  
[نَعَمْ، عِنْدَنَا طَعَامٌ.]{.ar}  

English also uses the word "there" with this existential meaning for sentences like:

i.  "There was a king."
ii. "There is no hope."

These sentences can be expressed in Arabuc without indefinite subjects. For example:

i.  [كَانَ مَلِكٌ.]{.ar}  
    This uses the _self-sufficient_ [كَانَ]{.ar}. (See section\ \@ref(self-sufficient-kaana).)

ii. [لَا أَمَلَ.]{.ar}  
    This uses the [nAfiyah lil-jins]{.trn2} [لَا]{.ar}. (See section\ \@ref(la-nafiyah-lil-jins).)

### Legitimate use of [هُنَاكَ]{.ar} and [يُوجَدُ]{.ar}

If, of course, a place is intended by "there" then there is no problem using [هُنَاكَ]{.ar} or its synonyms. For example:

[أَثَمَّ زَيْدٌ؟]{.ar}  
"Is Zayd there?"

Similarly, [يُوجَدُ]{.ar} may be used with no problem if the meaning "is (to be) found" is intended. For example:

[من قتل معاهدا لم يرح رائحة الجنة، وإن ريحها توجد من مسيرة أربعين عاماً]{.ar}

### Technical and scientific use of [يوجَد]{.ar}

Our above directive to avoid the use of [يوجد]{.ar} to mean "there is" holds for normal sentences.
Sometimes, however, a more technical meaning of "exists" is intended, especially in the language of science.
<!--
However, scholars, in developing branches of science, need to define terminology and use it in the precise manner which their science demands.
Historically, scholars have added on scientific meanings to existing words. There is no problem with this if done carefully and discriminately.
-->
In this case, [يوجد]{.ar} and its [ism mafeUl]{.trn2} [موجود]{.ar} may be used when needing to discuss the existence of something in a scientific text.
But such usage should be restricted to its domain, and should not, ideally, spill over to normal sentences, where a simple "there is" is intended.

While this concession can be granted to [يوجد]{.ar}, we find no such justifying circumstance for using [هناك]{.ar} existentially.

<!--## [_DamIr al-faSl]{.trn2} after [ism al-istifhAm]{.trn2}-->

## Pronoun of separation after question nouns

In later writing we find the following forms:

[مَنْ هِيَ زَيْنَب؟]{.ar}  
Who is Zaynab?

[مَا هُوَ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ؟]{.ar}  
What is [_islAm]{.trn2}?

[لِمَاذَا هُوَ حَزِينٌ؟]{.ar}  
Why is he sad?

The insertion of the pronoun of separation ([هُوَ]{.ar}, [هِيَ]{.ar}, etc.) after question nouns is best avoided.
So it is better to say:

[مَنْ زَيْنَب؟]{.ar}  
Who is Zaynab?

[مَا ٱلْإِسْلَامُ؟]{.ar}  
What is [_islAm]{.trn2}?

As for "why" sentences, Arabic has a native expression using [مَا لِ]{.ar} followed by a noun or pronoun in the i-state and then an adjective in the a-state.
For example:

[مَا لَهُ حَزِينًا؟]{.ar}  
Why is he sad?

Another option,
that is sometimes possible,
is to convert the "why" question into a "what" question, thus:

[مَا أَحْزَنَهُ]{.ar}  
Why is he sad?
(literally: What has made him sad?)

## "What happened to ..."

When asking the question, "What happened to a person/thing?" the verbs [فَعَلَ]{.ar} and [صَنَعَ]{.ar} are used and the person or thing asked about is made the ;fail;.
For example:

[يَا أَبَا عُمَيْرٍ مَا فَعَلَ النُّغَيْرُ]{.ar}  
What happened to [al-nugayr]{.trn2}  
bukhari:6129

[ما فعل أصحابك]{.ar}  
What happened to your companions?  
riyadussalihin:30

[مَا فَعَلَتِ الرَّيْطَةُ]{.ar}  
What happened to the thin cloak?  
ibnmajah:3603

[فَيَسْأَلُونَهُ مَاذَا فَعَلَ فُلاَنٌ مَاذَا فَعَلَ فُلاَنٌ]{.ar}  
So they ask him: What happened to so-and-so? What happened to so-and-so?  
nasai:1833

## about

The word "about" is often indiscriminately translated as [عَنْ]{.ar}.
[عَنْ]{.ar} is to be used, but only in specific circumstances.
For example, with  the verb [سَأَلَ]{.ar}.

[سَأَلَهُ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
He asked him about a matter.

We have also found [عَنْ]{.ar} in the narration:

[ مَا هَذَا الَّذِي يَذْكُرُونَ عَنِ الْحَسَنِ]{.ar}  
abudawud:4621

Usually, though, the preposition [فِي]{.ar} should be used instead. For example:



## "What about ..."

Avoid 
[مَاذَا عَنْ]{.ar}
when asking "What about someone/something?"

Instead use 
[مَا بَالُ]{.ar}.

For example:

[حَتَّى إِذَا فَرَغَ مَشَيْتُ، فَقُلْتُ مَا بَالُ الْعَظْمِ وَالرَّوْثَةِ ]{.ar}  
bukhari:3860

[إِذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاَهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ ". قِيلَ فَهَذَا الْقَاتِلُ، فَمَا بَالُ الْمَقْتُولِ]{.ar}  
bukhari:7083

[عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّهَا قَالَتْ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ مَا الشَّىْءُ الَّذِي لاَ يَحِلُّ مَنْعُهُ قَالَ الْمَاءُ وَالْمِلْحُ وَالنَّارُ " . قَالَتْ قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ هَذَا الْمَاءُ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاهُ فَمَا بَالُ الْمِلْحِ وَالنَّارِ]{.ar}  
ibnmajah:2474

When the question "What about ...?" is asked as a follow-up to a previous statement then the asked about person/thing can be asked by itself in a single word.
For example:

[عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّهُ نَهَى أَنْ يَشْرَبَ الرَّجُلُ قَائِمًا . قَتَادَةُ فَقُلْنَا فَالأَكْلُ فَقَالَ ذَاكَ أَشَرُّ أَوْ أَخْبَثُة]{.ar}
"what about eating?"
muslim:2024b

[قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لِلْمُتَلاَعِنَيْنِ " حِسَابُكُمَا عَلَى اللَّهِ أَحَدُكُمَا كَاذِبٌ لاَ سَبِيلَ لَكَ عَلَيْهَا " . قَالَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ مَالِي]{.ar}  
"What about my wealth?"
abudawud:2257
