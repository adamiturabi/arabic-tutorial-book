# ;inna; and its sisters

;wip_warn;

## Introduction

The ;arch; ;j_ism; is governed by an abstract ;pregov; that governs
a ;mubtada; and its ;xabar;, both in the ;ustate;.

For example:

(@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans} . 

In example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun)
above, an abstract ;pregov; governs the ;mubtada;
[زَيْد]{.ar}
and
its ;xabar;
[قَائِم]{.ar}
both in the ;ustate;.

;inna; and its sisters
are a set of six ;pregov; particles
that take an ;arch; ;j_ism; as their input and
transform it, by governing
the ;mubtada; in the ;ustate; and the ;xabar; in the ;ustate;.
Furthermore, each particle has its own meaning that it imparts to the input sentence.

For example, the particle ;inna; can take 
example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
as input and transform it into:

(@inna_zaydan_qaaimun) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans} . 

As you can see,
the ;pregov; particle ;inna;
has transformed the input example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun)
by governing the ;ism_of;
[زَيْد]{.ar} in the ;astate;
and
its ;xabar;
[قَائِم]{.ar} in the ;ustate;.
It has also added the assertive meaning "[indeed]{.trans}".

The set of
;inna; and its sisters
is:

  i. ;inna;
 ii. ;anna;
iii. ;ka_anna;
 iv. ;lakinna;
  v. ;layta;
 vi. ;la3alla;

We will discuss them in the following sections.

## ;inna;

(@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

## ;anna;

### Interpretation of the ;anna; clause as a ;masdar; construction

;anna; may be translated as "[that]{.trans}".
;anna; is unique amongst
;inna; and its sisters
that when it transforms an input ;j_ism;
the output is actually not a ;isnaad_comp; sentence anymore.
Here is its output after transforming example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun):

(@anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [that Zayd is standing]{.trans}

As you can see above,
example (@anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
does not stand by itself as a complete sentence.
Terminologically,
[زَيْدًا]{.ar}
is the ;ism_of; of ;anna;
and 
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar} is
its ;xabar;.
But once ;anna; has been added to the sentence, then the resulting output actually
only constitutes a single structural element of a sentence.
Let's explain what we mean
by making example (@anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
a part of a larger sentence:

<!--
In order to make example () structutally complete
it has to be part of a larger sentence.
So for example, we could say:
-->

(@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [That Zayd is standing pleases me.]{.trans}

Now the sentence is ;isnaad_comp;.
In this sentence,
the ;anna; clause
(i.e. ;anna;, its ;ism_of;, and its ;xabar; together)
structurally constitutes the ;musnadi; of the sentence
as the ;faa3il; of the verb
[يُعْجِبُنِي]{.ar}.
The verb
[يُعْجِبُنِي]{.ar}
is the ;musnad; of the sentence.

The grammarians have theorized that 
the ;anna; clause
is able to constitute a single structural element
by interpreting it as a
;masdar; construction.
And the ;masdar; is then able to take the place of the single structural element of the sentence.
In example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
the ;masdar; interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
[that Zayd is standing]{.trans}
is theorized as
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
[Zayd's standing(ness)]{.trans}.
If we replace 
the ;anna; clause
in example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
with this interpreted ;masdar; construction,
we get:

(@) [يُعْجِبُنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd's standing(ness) pleases me.]{.trans}.

Now we can see how
the interpreted ;masdar; construction
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
constitutes the ;musnadi; of the sentence.
(Technically,
the ;mudaf;
[قِيَامُ]{.ar} is the ;musnadi; and
[زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
is it its ;mudafil; governee,
but loosely speaking they can be considered one unit.)

Because of this interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
as a 
;masdar; construction,
;anna; is also known as
the _;masdar;i_ ;anna;.

We have already studied in chapter\ (ref) a similar particle
the ;masdar;i [أَنْ]{.ar}.
The _;masdar;i_ ;anna; and
the ;masdar;i [أَنْ]{.ar}
are actually closely linked and we will study some aspects of
their relationship in section\ (ref) below ;ia;.

By the way,
the interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
as a
;masdar; construction
does not mean that
the sentence with the
;masdar; construction
will have exactly the same meaning as the
sentence with ;anna;.
Rather the 
;masdar; interpretation only helps us analyze the sentence grammatically.
And it will also help us determine when we can use
the ;masdar;i ;anna; as opposed to other alternatives.

### ;anna; clauses as different elements of a sentence

Let's get back to
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
[That Zayd is standing pleases me]{.trans}.
In this sentence,
as we just discussed,
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar},
because of its interpretation as
the ;masdar; construction
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar},
constitutes a single structural element.
In
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun),
it constitutes the ;faa3il; of a ;j_f3l;,
which is a ;3umdah; element.
But an ;anna; clause need not a constitute a ;faa3il;,
or a ;3umdah; element for that matter.
An ;anna; clause may constitute various elements of a sentence.
We will discuss them below:

#### The ;anna; clause as the ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

We have already seen an example of
the ;anna; clause as the ;faa3il; in
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}.
Here is another example:




### Optionally drop prep before ;anna;

### Significance of ;anna;

assertive, from @nahw_arabi@

## rest of sisters in turn

## pronoun ;ism_of;

## complete sentence as the ;xabar;

## ;damir_shan; as the ;ism_of;

## lianna liannahu
