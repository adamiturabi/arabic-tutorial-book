# [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters {#inna-and-its-sisters}

## Introduction

In the basic subject-information sentence, both the subject and the information are in the u-state. For example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{مُعَلِّمٌ} \txarb{ٱَلرَّجُلُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize information};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=4.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The man is a teacher.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"This man is a teacher."

In the above sentence both the subject [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar} "the man", and the information [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} "a teacher" are in the u-state. In this chapter we will study a family of particles, called
[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters,
that modify the subject-information sentence by placing the subject in the a-state instead of the u-state. For example,

[إِنَّ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
[Einna -rrajula mueallimun.]{.trn}  
"Indeed the man is a teacher."

Note how, in the above example, the subject [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar} "the man" is now in the a-state. The information [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} "a teacher" remains in the u-state. 

The particles constituting the family of 
[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters
are:

1. [إِنَّ]{.ar}  [Einna]{.trn}     \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [أَنَّ]{.ar}  [Eanna]{.trn}     \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [كَأَنَّ]{.ar}  [kaEanna]{.trn}  \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar}  [lAkinna]{.trn} \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَيْتَ]{.ar}  [layta]{.trn}    \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَعَلَّ]{.ar}  [laealla]{.trn}  \vphantom{\huge J}

We shall now study each of these particles.

## [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn}

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is used to begin independent sentences. It has an emphatic meaning, as if the speaker is asserting the information about the subject. It is often translated into English as "indeed" or "verily", but it is also often left untranslated.

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is only used to begin subject-information sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} directly. (Later, in section\ \@ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.). For example,

[إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِنْدَ ٱللَّـٰهِ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[Einna -ddIna einda -llAhi -lEislAmu.]{.trn}  
"Indeed, the religion in the sight of [#allAh]{.trn2} is [#islAm]{.trn2}." ([#qurEAn]{.trn2}\ 3:19, trans. Saheeh International)

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} 
may be preceded by other particles like [وَ]{.ar} "and", [فَ]{.ar} "so", and [ثُمَّ]{.ar} "then". For example,

[ٱُطْلُبِ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ. فَإِنَّ طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ. وَإِنَّ تَرْكَهُ غَفْلَةٌ.]{.ar}
"Seek the useful knowledge. For indeed the seeking of the useful knowledge is a good deed. And indeed leaving it is a negligence."

The subject of
[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} 
may be a noun phrase, in which case, any describers or replacements of the subject are also in the a-state. Examples:

[إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالَ ٱلْكِرَامَ أَصْدِقَائِي.]{.ar}  
"Indeed these noble men are my friends."

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} may have multiple subjects, each in the a-state, separated by [وَ]{.ar}. Example,

[إِنَّ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَٱلْمُسْلِمَاتِ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱللَّـٰهَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed the Muslim men and Muslim women worship [#allAh]{.trn2}."

If the information of the first subject has been mentioned before the second subject, then the second subject may optionally be in the a-state or the u-state. For example:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرًا.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرٌو.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is sitting and [#eamr]{.trn2} [as well]."

[إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَكَ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَاكُ لَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed this book is for me and that book is for you."

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} may be used to begin sentences with an indefinite subject. For example,

[إِنَّ مَلِكًا مِنَ ٱلْهِنْدِ كَتَبَ إِلَىٰ أَحَدِ وُزَرَائِهِ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed a king from India wrote to one of his ministers."

Note that in all the above examples that
[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is only used to begin subject-information sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} directly. (Later, in section\ \@ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.).
By default, the subject of [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} must directly follow it with no intervening words or particles. The only exception is when the information consists of a prepositional or adverbial phrase, it is then allowed to precede the subject. The subject, in any case, shall be in the a-state. For example,

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the house, is a man."

[إِنَّ تَحْتَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ كَنْزًا ثَمِينًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, under the tree, is a precious treasure."

This reverse order is permitted even when the subject is definite. For example,

[إِنَّ مَعَكَ صَاحِبَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, with you, is _your companion_."

This puts the logical accent on the subject [صَاحِبَكَ]{.ar} "your companion". If the subject is placed first then this puts the logical accent on the information:

[إِنَّ صَاحِبَكَ مَعَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed your companion is _with_ you."

If the subject contains a pronoun that refers to a noun in the information then the information must precede the subject. For example,

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْمَصْنَعِ عُمَّالَهُ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the factory, are its workers."

[إِنَّ أَمَامَ ٱلدَّارِ حَارِسَهَا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in front of the door, is its guard."

### Pronoun subjects

<!--In the examples above, the subject of [إِنَّ]{.ar} has been a noun. -->
The subject of [إِنَّ]{.ar} may be a pronoun instead of a noun. For this the attached pronouns are used. For example,

[لَا تَقْطَعْ تِلْكَ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَإِنَّهَا ظَلِيلَةٌ.]{.ar}  
"Don't cut that tree, for it is shady."

[إِنَّكُمَا صَدِيقَايَ.]{.ar}  
"You~2~ are my friends."

The speaker pronouns, both singular and plural, may optionally keep or drop their [ن]{.ar}. 
So for the singular speaker pronoun both [إِنَّنِي]{.ar} [EinnanI]{.trn} and [إِنِّي]{.ar} [EinnI]{.trn} may be used.
And for the plural speaker pronoun both [إِنَّنَا]{.ar} [EinnanA]{.trn} and [إِنَّا]{.ar} [EinnA]{.trn} may be used.
Examples:

[إِنِّي مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّنِي مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed I am a Muslim."

[إِنَّنَا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed we are the writers of this book."

TODO: Multiple pronoun subjects: [إِنِّ وَ إِيَّاكَ ...]{.ar}

[إِنَّ]{.ar} with the speaker pronouns are often used with doer verbal nouns to signify that the speaker intends to to the action of the verb. For example,

[إِنِّي ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.]{.ar}  
"I'm going to the mosque."

We also mentioned this point in section\ \@ref(doer-verbal-noun-for-intended-future-action).

### [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} with a strengthening [لَ]{.ar} {#inna-strengthening-la}

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar} adds extra emphasis and may optionally be used between the subject of [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its information.
If the subject occurs first (as is the default) then [لَ]{.ar} is connected to and placed directly before the information. For example:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is definitely standing."

If the information precedes the subject, then then [لَ]{.ar} is connected to and placed directly before the subject. For example:

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ لَرَجُلًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the house, is definitely a man."

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar} is only used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and not for any of its other sisters
([إِنَّ]{.ar},
[أَنَّ]{.ar},
[كَأَنَّ]{.ar},
[لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar},
[لَيْتَ]{.ar}, and
[لَعَلَّ]{.ar}).

### Commonality of rules for [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters

Unless otherwise noted, the rules we have presented above for 
[إِنَّ]{.ar},
for example, the subject being in the a-state, the order of the subject and the predicate, the use of attached pronouns for the subject, etc.,
apply also to its other sisters. 

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar}, as mentioned above, is only used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and not for any of its other sisters.

## [أَنَّ]{.ar} [Eanna]{.trn}

The particle 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} [Eanna]{.trn}
can be translated as "that".
It is similar to [إِنَّ]{.ar} in that it is asserts the information about the subject.
But 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} is different from [إِنَّ]{.ar} in that [إِنَّ]{.ar}, its subject, and its information together constitute a complete sentence.
Whereas 
the
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
([أَنَّ]{.ar}
, its subject, and its information together) does not constitute a complete sentence. For example, consider the expression:

[زَيْدٌ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd is truthful."

This is a complete sentence. But if we add 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} "that" to its beginning, it no longer remains a complete sentence:

[أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ]{.ar}  
"that Zayd is truthful"

We need to additional words, external to the 
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
to complete the sentence. We will see examples of this below.

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the direct doee

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ} \txarb{أَعْلَمُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize direct doee};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I know that Zayd is truthful.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"I know that Zayd is truthful."

Note how, in the example above the 
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
([أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ]{.ar})
has occupied the place of the direct doee of the verb [أَعْلَمُ]{.ar}.

In a similar manner,
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clauses can be placed where one would expect other noun positions, such as: a subject, an information, a doer, and more. Here are some examples:

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the doer

Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّكَ مَرِيضٌ} \txarb{بَلَغَنِي},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize doer};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``That you are sick has reached me.'' (``It has reached me that you are sick.'')};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"That you are sick has reached me." ("It has reached me that you are sick.")

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the subject

Example (with information before subject in sentence word order):

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ} \txarb{مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``From his characteristics is that he is noble.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"From his characteristeics is that he is noble."

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the information

Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ ذَهَبَ} \txarb{ٱَلْحَقُّ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize information};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The truth is that he went."

### [أَنَّ]{.ar} with [كَانَ]{.ar}

As you know, [كَانَ]{.ar}'s doer is also its subject, and its doee is also its information.
The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in either the subject or the information of [كَنَ]{.ar}. 
For example, the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause as the information:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَفْعَلْ وَاجِبَهُ} \txarb{كَانَ ٱلْأَمْرُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize information};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The matter was that he didn't do his obligation."

Now, the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause as the subject:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَفْعَلْ وَاجِبَهُ} \txarb{كَانَ ٱلْأَمْرَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"That he didn't do his obligation was the matter."

Note that in the latter case, the information precedes the subject.

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of an i-state noun

The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in place of an i-state base noun in an annexation. Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ ٱلسَّفَرَ خَطِرٌ} \txarb{كَثُرَ قَاطِعُو ٱلطَّرِيقِ لِدَرَجَةِ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize base noun};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The highway robbers (literally: the cutters of the way) have increased to the degree that the journey is dangerous."

The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in place of an i-state  noun directly following a preposition. Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ زَيْدًا نَائِمٌ} \txarb{عَجِبْتُ مِنْ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize i-state after preposition};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"I wondered at that Zayd is asleep."

#### Optionally deleting the preposition directlt before an [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause

If an
[أَنَّ]{.ar} clause
directly follows a preposition, it is permissible to optionally delete the preposition as long as the meaning remains clear.
So the previous example can be expressed without the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} with the same meaning:

[عَجِبْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا نَائِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at that Zayd is asleep."

#### [لِأَنَّ]{.ar} "because"

The combination of the preposition [لِ]{.ar} "for" and [أَنَّ]{.ar} is used to mean "because". For example,

[أَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لِأَنَّنِي كُنْتُ جَائِعًا.]{.ar}  
"I ate the food because I was hungry."

### Equivalence of the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause with a verbal noun of doing

As a matter of grammatical theory, the
[أَنَّ]{.ar} clause, i.e. ([أَنَّ]{.ar} itself, its subject, and its information) is considered equivalent to a verbal noun of doing (typically in an annexation, and possibly with a doee as well). It is this equivalalence that allows it to thake the place of a doer, direct doee, and the other categories we have given above.
For instance, consider the example:

[عَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at that Zayd went."

Here, the clause
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب]{.ar}
is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase [ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ]{.ar} "Zayd's going". So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:

[عَجِبْتُ مِنْ ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at Zayd's going."

Similarly, in the example,

[مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
"From his characteristics is that he is generous."

the clause
[أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ]{.ar}
is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase [كَرَامَتِهِ]{.ar} "his generosity". So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:

[كَرَامَتِهِ مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ.]{.ar}  
"His generosity is from his characteristics."

This grammatical equivalence is more a matter of theory than of practical usefulness to us.
And you have seen this grammatical equivalence before with [أَنْ]{.ar} and a-state incomplete action verbs in chanpter\ \@ref(a-state-incomplete-action-verbs-verbal-noun).

## [كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}

[كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}
may be translated as "[It is] as if".
It is actually simply the preposition [كَ]{.ar} "like" attached to [أَنَّ]{.ar}. But it is treated separately because, unlike [أَنَّ]{.ar},
[كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}, its subject, and its information constitute a complete sentence. For example,

[كَأَنَّ ٱلْأُمُّ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
"[It is] as if the mother is a school."

## Topic-comment sentences and the pronoun of the fact

### Topic-comment sentences

There is a sub-type of subject-information sentence called a topic-comment sentence. Here is an example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{فُرُوعُها طَوِيلَةٌ} \txarb{ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize subject/topic};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize information/comment};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The tree: its branches are long."

In these kinds of sentences, the subject introduces a topic, and the information is itself a sentence which comments on the topic/subject.
We have, in fact, already seen sentences like this in section\ \@ref(past-verbs-order-of-words), when we take a verbal sentence and convert it to a subject-information sentence. This is the example we discussed there:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
"The man: he wrote a book."

#### The linker pronoun

A topic-comment sentence typically requires a pronoun in the comment that links back to the comment. 
In the example
[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُفُرُوعُهَا طَوِيلَةٌ.]{.ar}, the attached pronoun [هَا]{.ar} "it" in [فُرُوعُهَا]{.ar} "its tree" is the linker pronoun that links back to the topic [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} "the tree".

Similarly, in the example
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}
the linker pronoun is the invisible doer pronoun "he" of the verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} "he wrote" that links back to the topic [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} "the man".

#### Topic-comment sentences with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters

[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters are very often used in topic-comment sentences. (With [أَنَّ]{.ar} it is, as usual, an incomplete sentence.) Here are some examples:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَهُ أَخٌ وَأُخْتٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd: he has a brother and sister."

[ٱِعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱلْعِلْمَ حُصُولُهُ يَتَطَلَّبُ جُهْدًا.]{.ar}  
"Know that knowledge: its obtaining requires effort."

#### Topic-comment sentences with a pronoun topic

The topic, in a topic-comment sentence, is frequently a pronoun. For example,

[أَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I: my name is Zayd."

[أَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لَـٰكِنَّكَ لَمْ تَأْكُلْ.]{.ar}  
"I ate the food but you: you didn't eat."

### The pronoun of the fact

Mostly, pronouns are used in place of nouns when it is already known to whom the noun refers to. So if you say:

[أَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I: my name is Zayd."

the pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} "I" refers to the speaker, who is known.

There is a special pronoun, called the _pronoun of the fact_ that begins topic-comment sentences. This pronoun does not refer to any previously known entity, but rather refers to the comment that follows it. It is sometimes translated as "the fact is" but is often left untranslated. Here is an example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ} \txarb{هُوَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize pronoun of the fact};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize information/comment};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The fact is: the cold is intense."

This pronoun is usually the singular masculine pronoun (as above) but it is also sometimes the singular feminine pronoun [هِيَ]{.ar}.
It is typically used with statements of import, to which the speaker wishes to draw attention.
The comment does not contain a linker pronoun because the whole comment refers back to the topic.
The pronoun of the fact is frequently used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters. 
Here are some examples:

[إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed."  
([#qurEAn]{.trn2} 23:117, trans. Saheeh International)

Sometimes, one can choose between using the pronoun of the fact and a pronoun matching the participant resulting in different emphasis. For example,

[إِنِّهُ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ]{.ar}  
"Indeed, the fact is: they are the doers."

[إِنِّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ]{.ar}  
"Indeed, _they_ are the doers."

## The lightened versions [إِنْ]{.ar}, [أَنْ]{.ar}, [كَأَنْ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}

The particles [إِنَّ]{.ar}, [أَنَّ]{.ar}, [كَأَنَّ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar}, because of the doubled [نّ]{.ar} are considered _heavy_.
There exist _lightened_ versions of these particles that are:
[إِنْ]{.ar}, [أَنْ]{.ar}, [كَأَنْ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}.
These lightened versions have similar meanings to their heavy counterparts but they have somewhat different rules. We will discuss them below.
In terms of their usage 
[إِنْ]{.ar} and
[كَأَنْ]{.ar} are not very commonly used except in the [#qurEAn]{.trn2}, poetry, and other rhetorical texts.
[أَنْ]{.ar} and
[لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}
are relatively more common.

### The lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}

The lightened
[إِنْ]{.ar}
is used in two different ways.
In the more common way, the subject is not put in the a-state but is rather in the u-state.
However, the strengthening [لَ]{.ar} (see section\ \@ref(inna-strengthening-la) above), that was optional with the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}, is now mandatory with the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}. For example,

[إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is a Muslim."

The other notable difference between 
the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}
and
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}
is that 
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar} is only used to introduce subject-information sentences.
The lightened [إِنْ]{.ar},
however, can be used to introduce verbal sentences, but only those that begin with the verbs:
[كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters,
[كَادَ]{.ar} and its sisters, and
[ظَنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters.
For example,

[قَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَإِنْ كَانَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَجَيِّدًا.]{.ar}  
"I read the book and indeed the book was good."

The second, less common way, of using
the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}
is following the same rules as the 
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}.
Where the subject is in the a-state and the use of the strengthening [لَ]{.ar} is optional. For example,

[إِنْ زَيْدًا مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is a Muslim."

### The lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} {#lightened-an}

As we know, the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} is an emphatic particle and is frequently used with the pronoun of the fact, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the fact is: the cold is intense."

When we wish not to use much emphasis, we may replace
the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} along with its following pronoun of the fact ([أَنَّهُ]{.ar}/[أَنَّهَا]{.ar}) with
a lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the cold is intense."

Note that
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} replaces 
[أَنَّهُ]{.ar},
which is the combination of
heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} _and_ the pronoun of the fact [هُ]{.ar}.
So the pronoun of the fact ([هُ]{.ar}) does not appear with
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}.

<!--
The combination of a heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} with a following pronoun of the fact ([أَنَّهُ]{.ar}/[أَنَّهَا]{.ar}) may be replaced with
a lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}. 
The pronoun of the fact ([هُ]{.ar}/[هَا]{.ar}) is then deleted.

only introduces topic-comment clauses whose topic is understood to be a deleted pronoun of the fact. 
The lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} only introduces topic-comment clauses whose topic is understood to be a deleted pronoun of the fact. 
The comment is, as usual, a complete sentence. 
For example, consider the following sentence with a heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar}:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the fact is: the cold is intense."

If we replace the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} in the above example with the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} then we pronoun of the fact topic is deleted, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the cold is intense."
-->

In the above example, 
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
introduces a comment which is a subject-predicate sentence.
But the more common use of 
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
is to introduce comments that are verbal sentences.

When the comment of the 
lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
is a verbal sentence, then it is  preferred to separate the verb from [أَنْ]{.ar} with one of the following:

1. [قَدْ]{.ar}. Example:
   
   [أَظُنُّ أَنْ قَدْ غَرَبَتِ ٱلشَّمْسُ.]{.ar}  
   "I think that the sun has set."

2. [سَ]{.ar} or [سَوْفَ]{.ar}. Example:

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ سَيَذْهَبُ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he will go."

3. A negative particle like [لَا]{.ar}, [لَنْ]{.ar}, or [لَمْ]{.ar}.

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَا يَذْهَبُ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he does/will not go."

   Note that, in writing, we have not combined the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and [لَا]{.ar} to form [أَلَّا]{.ar}, as is done for the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} (for example: [أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ]{.ar} "that he not go") in chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-incomplete-action-verbs). This distinction in spelling is not obligatory, but some authorities recommend it. In any case, they are both pronounced the same: [EallA]{.trn}. <!--al nahw al wafi 4/298, cited by Arik Sadan p.30 -->

   More examples:

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَنْ يَذْهَبَ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he shall not go."

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَمْ يَذْهَبْ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he did not go."

   Note that the [لَنْ]{.ar} and [لَمْ]{.ar}, even when after the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, change the state of the following incomplete-action verb to the a-state and 0-state respectively.

4. The conditional particle [لَوْ]{.ar}. We will study conditional sentences in chapter\ \@ref(conditional-sentences). TODO: add example.

Rigid verbs like [لَيْسَ]{.ar} and verbs expressing supplications are exempted from needing to be separated from the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}. Example:

[ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ لَيْسَ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدًا.]{.ar}  
"I thought that the cold is not intense."

#### Distinguishing between the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} 

Although they are similar in meaning,
care must be taken to distinguish between this lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} 
(that we learned in chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-incomplete-action-verbs)),
The a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} puts the following incomplete action verb in the a-state.
Whereas the incomplete action verb directly after the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} remains in the u-state.
The following guidelines can help to distinguish  between these two [أَنْ]{.ar}s:

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} signifies certainty then only [أَنَّ]{.ar} and its lightened version [أَنْ]{.ar} is used. For example,

  [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ قَدْ ذَهَبَ وَأَنْ سَيَرْجِعُ.]{.ar}  
  "I know that he has gone and that he will return."

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} signifies wanting, hoping, or expecting, then the [أَنْ]{.ar} puts the following verb in the a-state. For example,

  [أَطْمَعُ أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ.]{.ar}  
  "I hope that he not go."

  Note that the verb [يَذْهَبَ]{.ar} is in the a-state.

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} reflects a view of something going to occur, and signifies neither certainty nor expectation, but rather doubt or neutrality, then either of the [أَنْ]{.ar}s may be used, depending on the intended meaning. Such verbs include [ظَنَّ يَظُنُّ]{.ar} "to think" and [حَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ]{.ar} "to deem". For example,

  a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar}:  
  [ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعَ.]{.ar}  
  "I thought that he should return."  

  lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}:  
  [ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعُ.]{.ar}  
  "I thought that he will return."

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} does not reflect a view of something going to occur then the [أَنْ]{.ar} is typically the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar}. For example,

  [سَرَّنِي أَنْ تَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
  "That you succeed [will have] gladdened me."

  Remember from chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-incomplete-action-verbs)), that the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} can occur with completed-action verbs as well. Example:

  [سَرَّنِي أَنْ نَجَحْتَ]{.ar}  
  "That you have succeeded [has] gladdened me."

### The lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar}

The lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar} is similar to the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} in that it introduces a topic-comment sentence and the topic is usually a deleted pronoun of the fact. For example,

[كَأَنْ ٱلْبَرْدُ ذَهَبَ.]{.ar}  
"[It is] as if the cold has gone."

Also similar to the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, the lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar} may introduce a verbal sentence but it must be separated from [كَأَنْ]{.ar} by either [قَدْ]{.ar} or [لَمْ]{.ar}. For example,

[ذَهَبَ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَسْمَعْ.]{.ar}  
"He went as if he did not hear."

### The lightened [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}

The lightened [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar} has the same meaning as the heavy [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar} but it has no grammatical effect on the word or sentence after it. It may introduce either subject-information or verbal sentences. For example,

[نَجَحَ زَيْدٌ لَـٰكِنْ صَدِيقُهُ لَمْ يَنْجَحْ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd succeeded but his friend did not succeed."
