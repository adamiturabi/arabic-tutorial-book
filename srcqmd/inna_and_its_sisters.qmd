# ;inna; and its sisters

;wip_warn;

## Introduction

The ;arch; ;j_ism; is governed by an abstract ;pregov; that governs
a ;mubtada; and its ;xabar;, both in the ;ustate;.

For example:

(@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans} . 

In example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun)
above, an abstract ;pregov; governs the ;mubtada;
[زَيْد]{.ar}
and
its ;xabar;
[قَائِم]{.ar}
both in the ;ustate;.

;inna; and its sisters
are a set of six ;pregov; particles
that take an ;arch; ;j_ism; as their input and
transform it, by governing
the ;mubtada; in the ;ustate; and the ;xabar; in the ;ustate;.
Furthermore, each particle has its own meaning that it imparts to the input sentence.

For example, the particle ;inna; can take 
example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
as input and transform it into:

(@inna_zaydan_qaaimun) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans} . 

As you can see,
the ;pregov; particle ;inna;
has transformed the input example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun)
by governing the ;ism_of;
[زَيْد]{.ar} in the ;astate;
and
its ;xabar;
[قَائِم]{.ar} in the ;ustate;.
It has also added the assertive meaning "[indeed]{.trans}".

When the ;ism_of; of ;inna; or its sisters is a pronoun,
then then the attached pronouns are used.
(This is discussed in more detail in section\ (ref) below.)
For example:

(@) [إِنَّكَ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed you are standing.]{.trans} . 


The set of
;inna; and its sisters
is:

  i. ;inna;
 ii. ;anna;
iii. ;ka_anna;
 iv. ;lakinna;
  v. ;layta;
 vi. ;la3alla;

We will discuss them in the following sections.

## ;inna;

(@inna_zaydun_qaaimun) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

## ;anna;

### Interpretation of the ;anna; clause as a ;masdar; construction

;anna; may be translated as "[that]{.trans}".
;anna; is unique amongst
;inna; and its sisters
that when it transforms an input ;j_ism;
the output is actually not a ;isnaad_comp; sentence anymore.
Here is its output after transforming example (@inna_zaydun_qaaimun):

(@anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [that Zayd is standing]{.trans}

As you can see above,
example (@anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
does not stand by itself as a complete sentence.
Terminologically,
[زَيْدًا]{.ar}
is the ;ism_of; of ;anna;
and 
[قَائِمٌ]{.ar} is
its ;xabar;.
But once ;anna; has been added to the sentence, then the resulting output actually
only constitutes a single structural element of a sentence.
Let's explain what we mean
by making example (@anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
a part of a larger sentence:

<!--
In order to make example () structutally complete
it has to be part of a larger sentence.
So for example, we could say:
-->

(@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [That Zayd is standing pleases me.]{.trans}

Now the sentence is ;isnaad_comp;.
In this sentence,
the ;anna; clause
(i.e. ;anna;, its ;ism_of;, and its ;xabar; together)
structurally constitutes the ;musnadi; of the sentence
as the ;faa3il; of the verb
[يُعْجِبُنِي]{.ar}.
The verb
[يُعْجِبُنِي]{.ar}
is the ;musnad; of the sentence.

The grammarians have theorized that 
the ;anna; clause
is able to constitute a single structural element
by interpreting it as a
;masdar; construction.
And the ;masdar; is then able to take the place of the single structural element of the sentence.
In example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
the ;masdar; interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
[that Zayd is standing]{.trans}
is theorized as
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
[Zayd's standing(ness)]{.trans}.
If we replace 
the ;anna; clause
in example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun)
with this interpreted ;masdar; construction,
we get:

(@) [يُعْجِبُنِي قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd's standing(ness) pleases me.]{.trans}.

Now we can see how
the interpreted ;masdar; construction
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
constitutes the ;musnadi; of the sentence.
(Technically,
the ;mudaf;
[قِيَامُ]{.ar} is the ;musnadi; and
[زَيْدٍ]{.ar}
is it its ;mudafil; governee,
but loosely speaking they can be considered one unit.)

Because of this interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
as a 
;masdar; construction,
;anna; is also known as
the _;masdar;i_ ;anna;.

We have already studied in chapter\ (ref) a similar particle
the ;masdar;i [أَنْ]{.ar}.
The _;masdar;i_ ;anna; and
the ;masdar;i [أَنْ]{.ar}
are actually closely linked and we will study some aspects of
their relationship in section\ (ref) below ;ia;.

By the way,
the interpretation of
the ;anna; clause
as a
;masdar; construction
does not mean that
the sentence with the
;masdar; construction
will have exactly the same meaning as the
sentence with ;anna;.
Rather the 
;masdar; interpretation only helps us analyze the sentence grammatically.
And it will also help us determine when we can use
the ;masdar;i ;anna; as opposed to other alternatives.

### ;anna; clauses as different elements of a sentence

Let's get back to
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}
[That Zayd is standing pleases me]{.trans}.
In this sentence,
as we just discussed,
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar},
because of its interpretation as
the ;masdar; construction
[قِيَامُ زَيْدٍ]{.ar},
constitutes a single structural element.
In
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun),
it constitutes the ;faa3il; of a ;j_f3l;,
which is a ;3umdah; element.
But an ;anna; clause need not only constitute a ;faa3il;,
or a ;3umdah; element for that matter.
An ;anna; clause may constitute various elements of a sentence.
We will discuss them below:

#### The ;anna; clause as a ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

We have already seen an example of
the ;anna; clause as the ;faa3il; in
example (@yu3jibuni_anna_zaydan_qaaimun) [يُعْجِبُنِي أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}.
Here is another example:

(@) [بلغني أن زيدًا منطَلِقٌ]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/176](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/185#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[The news] that Zayd is setting out has reached me.]{.trans}

If we replace the ;anna; clause with its interpreted ;masdar; we get:

(@) [بلغني انطلاق زيدٍ]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/176](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/185#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Zayd's setting out has reached me.]{.trans}

#### The ;anna; clause as a ;naib; ;faa3il; {.unnumbered}

(@) [عرف أن السارق جريء]{.ar}
    [[nawh_waadiH 1/264](https://shamela.ws/book/10018/256)]{.citex}  
    [That the thief is bold was known.]{.trans}  

If we replace the ;anna; clause with its interpreted ;masdar; we get:

(@) [عرف جراءة السارق]{.ar}
    [[nawh_waadiH 1/264](https://shamela.ws/book/10018/256)]{.citex}  
    [The thief's boldness was known.]{.trans}  


#### The ;anna; clause as a ;mafulb; {.unnumbered}

The ;anna; clause can occur in the position of a ;mafulb;.
Here is an example:

(@) [عَلِمْتُ أنّكَ فَاضِلٌ]{.ar}  
    [I knew that you are excellent.]{.trans}  
    
If we replace the ;anna; clause with its interpreted ;masdar; we get:

(@) [عَلِمْتُ فَضْلَكَ]{.ar}  
    [I knew your excellence.]{.trans}  

<!--
(@) [سمعت أن عَمْرًا عالمٌ]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/177](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/186#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I heard that [#eamr]{.trn2} is knowledgeable.]{.trans}  

If we replace the ;anna; clause with its interpreted ;masdar; we get:

(@) [سمعت عِلْمَ عمرو]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/177](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/186#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I heard the knowledge of [#eamr]{.trn2}]{.trans}

<https://shamela.ws/book/19236/186#p1>:

::: {.ar}
ومفعولًا نحو: سمعت أن عَمْرًا عالمٌ، وهو مؤوّل بـ (سمعت عِلْمَ عمرو).

ومضافًا إليه نحو: عَجِبْتُ من أنّ بكرًا واقفٌ، وهو مؤوّل بـ (عجبت من وقوف بكرٍ)
:::

Besides these more common elements,
an ;anna; clause may constitute other elements as well,
like a ;mubtada; and a ;xabar; 
-->

#### The ;anna; clause in the ;istate;  {.unnumbered}

The ;anna; clause can occur after a preposition.
For example:

(@) [عَجِبْتُ من أنّ بكرًا واقفٌ]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/177](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/186#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at that Zayd is stopped standing.]{.trans}  

If we replace the ;anna; clause with its interpreted ;masdar; we get:

(@) [عجبت من وقوف بكرٍ]{.ar}
    [[@qawa3id_shaykh_zadeh@ 1/177](https://shamela.ws/book/19236/186#p1)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at Zayd's being stopped standing.]{.trans}  

The ;anna; clause can even occur as a ;mudafil;.
For example:

(@) [قَالَ أَيْنَ تُرِيدُ قَالَ أُرِيدُ أَخًا لِي فِي هَذِهِ الْقَرْيَةِ  قَالَ هَلْ لَكَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ تَرُبُّهَا قَالَ لاَ **غَيْرَ أَنِّي** أَحْبَبْتُهُ فِي اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ]{.ar}  
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2567a@]{.citex}  
    [[He said, "Where are you intending [to go]?" He said, "I intend [to go to] a brother of mine in this town." He said, "Do you have upon him a favor that [you are seeking repayment for]?" He said, "No, **except that** I have loved him [for the sake of] ;Allah; the Exalted and Glorious."]{.trans}  

#### The ;anna; clause as a ;mubtada; {.unnumbered}

The ;anna; clause as a ;mubtada; is not as common as the other categories,
and has some restrictions.
Generally, it won't begin the sentence.
Instead, its ;xabar; will usually precede it.^[See [@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1) for an exception. See also [@sharh_ashmooni@ 1/204 (editor's footnote)](https://shamela.ws/book/11742/195) for another example.]
For example:

(@) [في ظني أنك فاضل]{.ar}
    [[@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[It is] in my estimation that you are excellent.]{.trans}  
    ([في ظني]{.ar} is analyzed as a fronted ;xabar; and the interpreted ;masdar; construction
    [فَضْلُكَ]{.ar} [your excellence]{.trans} is the backed ;mubtada;.)

(@) [وَمِنۡ ءَایَـٰتِهِۦۤ أَنَّكَ تَرَى ٱلۡأَرۡضَ خَـٰشِعَةࣰ]{.quran}
    [@https://quran.com/41/39@]{.citex}^[See @https://tafsir.app/iraab-daas/41/39@ and [@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 2/206 (editor's footnote)](https://shamela.ws/book/11825/573).]  
    [And of His signs is that you see the earth stilled]{.trans}


(@) [أحقا أنك ذاهب]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 2/205](https://shamela.ws/book/11825/572)]{.citex}  
    [[Is it] really that you are going?]{.trans}  
    (The interpreted ;masdar; [ذَهَابُكَ]{.ar} is the ;mubtada;.
    [حَقًّا]{.ar} is analyzed as an adverb ;xabar;.^[See [@ibn_hisham_awdah_almasaalik@ 2/206 (editor's footnote)](https://shamela.ws/book/11825/573).])

<!--
But when preceded by
[أَمَا]{.ar}
[OOO]{.trans},
then the ;mubtada; ;anna; clause is allowed to precede its ;xabar;.^[[@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1)]
For example:

(@) [أما أنك فاضل ففي ظني]{.ar}
    [[@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1)]{.citex}^[See also [@sharh_ashmooni@ 1/204 (editor's footnote)](https://shamela.ws/book/11742/195)]
    [Verily, that you are excellent, then [it is] in my estimation]{.trans}  
-->

The ;anna; may even be an ;ism_of; of ;inna; and [كَانَ]{.ar}.
Examples:

(@) [كان في ظني أنك فاضل]{.ar}
    [[@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1)]{.citex}  
    [[It] was in my estimation that you are excellent.]{.trans}  

As the ;ism_of; of ;inna;, the ;anna; clause must be separated from ;inna;:

(@) [إن عندي أنك فاضل]{.ar}
    [[@aljani_aldani@ 408](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/390#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed [it is your rank] with me that you are excellent.]{.trans}  
    i.e. [You are excellent in my sight.]{.trans}

#### The ;anna; clause as a ;xabar; {.unnumbered}

(@) [أمرك أنك ذاهب]{.ar}
    [[@aljani_aldani@ 409](https://shamela.ws/book/26099/391#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Your state-of-affairs is that you are going.]{.trans}  
    (The interpreted ;masdar; [ذَهَابُكَ]{.ar} is the ;xabar;.)

### The interpreted ;masdar; when the ;xabar; of ;anna; is a prepositional/adverbial phrase

Consider the following sentences,
where the ;xabar; of ;anna; is a prepositional or adverbial phrase:

(@) [عجبتُ من أن زيداً عندك]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 24/10](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/419)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at that Zayd is at [your place].]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;anna; is an adverbial phrase: [عِنْدَكَ]{.ar} [at your place]{.trans}.)

<!--
(@) [عجبت من أن زيداً في الدار]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 24/10](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/419)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at that Zayd is in the house.]{.trans}  
-->

(@) [علمت أن زيداً في الدار]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 37/15](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/688)]{.citex}  
    [I knew that Zayd is in the house.]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;anna; is an adverbial phrase: [فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar} [in the house]{.trans}.)


In such cases, the interpreted ;masdar; is general beingness, represented by the ;masdar;
[كَوْن]{.ar}
or
[اسْتِقْرَار]{.ar},
as
below:

(@) [عجبت من استقرار زيدٍ عندك]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 24/10](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/419)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at Zayd's being at [your place].]{.trans}  

(@) [علمت كون زيد في الدار]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 37/15](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/688)]{.citex}  
    [I knew Zayd's being in the house.]{.trans}  

### The interpreted ;masdar; when the ;xabar; of ;anna; is a ;substantive;

Consider the following sentence,
where the ;xabar; of ;anna; is a ;substantive;:


(@) [علمت أن زيداً أسد]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 37/15](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/688)]{.citex}  
    [I knew that Zayd is a lion.]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;anna; is a substantive noun: [أَسَدٌ]{.ar} [a lion]{.trans}.)

In this case as well, the interpreted ;masdar; can be general beingness:

(@) [علمت كون زيد أسداً]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 37/15](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/688)]{.citex}  
    [I knew Zayd's being a lion.]{.trans}  

Or the interpreted ;masdar; can be formed from the ;substantive;, using the suffix
[ـِيَّة]{.ar} [-iyyah]{.trn}
(see section\ (ref)),
as below:

(@) [علمت أسدية زيد]{.ar}
    [[haazimi 37/15](https://shamela.ws/book/36130/688)]{.citex}  
    [I knew Zayd's lion-like-ness.]{.trans}  

### Optionally delete the preposition before ;anna;

When the ;anna; clause is in the ;istate; following a preposition,
then it is allowed to (optionally) delete the preposition, for the same meaning,
as long as the meaning remains clear.
So, instead of saying:

(@) [عجبت **من** أنك قائم]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/151](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/538)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered at that you are standing.]{.trans}  

 we can say:

(@) [عجبت أنك قائم]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 2/151](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/538)]{.citex}  
    [I wondered that you are standing.]{.trans}  

<!--
### ;anna; with ;kaana;

See TODO for ;kaana; chapter
-->

### A ;3atf; following ;anna;

### [لِأَنَّ]{.ar} [because]{.trans}

The preposition [لِ]{.ar} when attached before ;anna; can signify the meaning
[because]{.trans}.^[@wright@ 1/293B]
For example:

(@) [قَالَ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم إِذَا أُتِيَ بِطَعَامٍ أَكَلَ مِنْهُ وَبَعَثَ بِفَضْلِهِ إِلَىَّ وَإِنَّهُ بَعَثَ إِلَىَّ يَوْمًا بِفَضْلَةٍ لَمْ يَأْكُلْ مِنْهَا **لأَنَّ** فِيهَا ثُومًا فَسَأَلْتُهُ أَحَرَامٌ هُوَ قَالَ لاَ وَلَكِنِّي أَكْرَهُهُ مِنْ أَجْلِ رِيحِهِ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/muslim:2053@]{.citex}  
    [He said, "The Messenger of ;Allah; ;pbuh; would, when he was brought some food, eat from it and send its extra to me. And indeed he sent to me, one day, some extra having not eaten from it **because** in it was some garlic. So I asked him, 'Is it unlawful?' He said, 'No, but I dislike it because of its odor.'"]{.trans}

<!--
### Significance of ;anna;

;anna;, like ;inna; essentially signifies an assertive meaning.
That is why it frequently (but not exclusively) occurs after nouns indicating knowledge with certainty.
assertive, from @nahw_arabi@
-->

## rest of sisters in turn

## pronoun ;ism_of;

## A prepositional/adverbial phrase as the ;xabar; of ;inna; and its sisters

A prepositional/adverbial phrase can occurs as the ;xabar; of ;inna; and its sisters.
For example:

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدٌ فِي الدَّارِ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is in the house.]{.trans}  

(@) [عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا عِنْدَكَ]{.ar}
    [Indeed Zayd is at [your place].]{.trans}  

In such cases,
based on what we have learned in section\ (ref),
the ;xabar; is actually implicated as general beingness,
and the preposition or adverb is its governee.
But loosely speaking we may say that
the prepositional/adverbial phrase is the ;xabar;.

## A complete sentence as the ;xabar; of ;inna; and its sisters

The ;xabar; of ;inna; and its sisters may be a complete sentence.
Examples:

(@) [إِنَّ الْعِلْمَ يُعَزِّزُ صَاحِبَهُ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 272]{.citex}  
    [Indeed the knowledge -- it makes esteemed its companion.]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;inna; is the ;j_f3l; [يُعَزِّزُ صَاحِبَهُ]{.ar} [it makes esteemed its companion]{.trans}.)

(@) [إِنَّ الْعَالِمَ قَدْرُهُ مُرْتَفِعٌ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/272]{.citex}  
    [Indeed the scholar -- his worth is high.]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;inna; is the ;j_ism; [قَدْرُهُ مُرْتَفِعٌ]{.ar} [his worth is high]{.trans}.)

(@) [لَعَلَّكَ اجْتَهَدْتَ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/272]{.citex}  
    [Perhaps you may exert yourself.]{.trans}  
    (The ;xabar; of ;la3alla; is the ;j_f3l; [اجْتَهَدْتَ]{.ar} [you exert yourself]{.trans}.)

The ;xabar; of ;inna; (and its sisters) 
can even be a compound itself itself.
Here is an example where the ;xabar; of ;inna;
is a ;kaana; sentence with its own ;ism_of; and ;j_f3l; ;xabar;:

(@) [وَإِنَّ أَبَا هُرَيْرَةَ **كَانَ يَلْزَمُ** رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بِشِبَعِ بَطْنِهِ وَيَحْضُرُ مَا لاَ يَحْضُرُونَ وَيَحْفَظُ مَا لاَ يَحْفَظُونَ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:118@]{.citex}  
    [And indeed [#abU #hurayrah]{.trn2} used to stick with the Messenger of ;Allah; with the fill of his stomach and be present for what they [were] not present for, and memorize what they [were] not memorizing.]{.trans}

## Word order of the ;ism_of; and the ;xabar; with ;inna; and its sisters

The ;ism_of; of ;inna; (and its sisters) must always follow it in word order.
And its ;xabar; must always follow the ;ism_of;.
So, for example,
we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [إِنَّ قَائِمٌ زَيْدًا]{.ar}
    [[@sharh_qatr_alnada@ 162](https://shamela.ws/book/6970/137)]{.citex}  

We must say instead:

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}

If the ;xabar; has a governee, then it too
should not, in general, preceded the ;ism_of;.
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [إن **طعامك** زيدا آكل]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  

We must say instead:

(@) [إن زيدا آكل **طعامك**]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is eating your food.]{.trans}  

The following word order is also permissible, for the same meaning:

(@) [إن زيدا **طعامك** آكل]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/317](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/978)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is eating your food.]{.trans}  

But when the governee of the ;xabar; is a prepositional or adverbial phrase,
then there is some diagreement amongst the grammarians.^[[@irtishaaf@ 3/1244](https://shamela.ws/book/16595/1244); [@sirafi_sibawayhi@ 2/464](https://shamela.ws/book/17726/962)]
Some grammarians allowed
sentences like:

(@) [إِنَّ **عِنْدَكَ** زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed with you Zayd is sitting.]{.trans}  

(@) [إن **بك** زيدا واثق]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed in you Zayd is trusting.]{.trans}  
    
Others disallowed such sentences and mandated the following order^[[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]:

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ **عِنْدَكَ**]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is sitting with you.]{.trans}  

(@) [إن زيدا واثق **بك**]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/349](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/348)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is trusting in you.]{.trans}  

But when the ;xabar; is itself
(loosely speaking) the prepositional or adverbial phrase,
then then it may be placed before the ;ism_of; undisputably.
Sometimes, placing the 
prepositional/adverbial phrase
before the ;ism_of; is optional.
For example:

(@) [إِنَّ فِي الدَّارِ ضُيُوفًا كِرَامًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/273]{.citex}  
    [Indeed in the house are noble guests.]{.trans}  

(@) [لَيْتَ عِنْدَكَ مُحَمَّدًا]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/273]{.citex}  
    [O that with you was [#muHammad]{.trn2}]{.trans}  


But
when the prepositional/adverbial phrase has a pronoun that refers to the ;ism_of;,
then it must obligatorily be placed before the ;ism_of;.
For example:

(@) [إِنَّ فِي الدَّارِ سَاكِنَهَا]{.ar}
    [[@irtishaaf@ 3/1244](https://shamela.ws/book/16595/1244)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed in the house is its resident.]{.trans}

(@) [إِنَّ عِنْدَ هِنْدٍ بَعْلَهَا]{.ar}
    [[@irtishaaf@ 3/1244](https://shamela.ws/book/16595/1244)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed with Hind is her husband.]{.trans}

## A ;damir_shan; as the ;ism_of; of ;inna; and its sisters

A ;damir_shan; can occur as the ;ism_of; of ;inna; and its sisters.
In this case,
as usual,
the ;xabar; will be a complete sentence.

As with ;kaana;, when the ;ism_of; is a ;damir_shan;,
then the ;xabar; can be a ;j_ism; or a ;j_f3l;.

For example:

(@) [**إِنَّهَا** تَكُونُ الظُّلْمَةُ وَالسَّيْلُ]{.ar}
    [@https://sunnah.com/bukhari:667@]{.citex}  
    [The state-of-affairs is: [there] is [at times] darkness and flooding]{.trans}  


## ;inna; with a ;laam_ibt;

The _;laam_ibt;_ is a particle which generally occurs in the beginning of a sentence signifies an assertive meaning.
For example, if we start with:

(@) [زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Zayd is standing.]{.trans}  

then we can make the sentence more assertive by using ;laam_ibt; in its beginning:

(@) [لَزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ]{.ar}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}  

The ;laam_ibt;, in sentences without ;inna; (as above),
is placed in the beginning of the sentence
and is attached only to the ;mubtada;.
If the ;xabar; were fronted, we wouldn't say:

(@) ;x; [لَقَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/353](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1014#p1)]{.citex}  


### The ;laam_ibt; place before the ;xabar; of ;inna;

This ;laam_ibt; is frequently found used with ;inna;.
But instead of occurring before ;inna; thus:

(@) ;x; [لَإِنَّ]{.ar}

it is placed between the ;ism_of; of ;inna; and its ;xabar;, thus:

(@) [إِنَّ زَيْدٌ لَقَائِمٌ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is standing.]{.trans}  


When [إِنَّ]{.ar} is used together with ;laam_ibt; as in the example above,
then the sentence signifies extra assertion,
compared to if had only ;inna; or only the ;laam_ibt;.

In a similar manner to example () above,
we can say:

(@) [إن زيدًا لفي الدار]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is in the house.]{.trans}  

The ;laam_ibt; 
has certain restrictions placed on its usage,
when used with ;inna;:

Firstly, it caan only be used with ;inna; and not with any of its sisters.

Secondly, the ;inna; sentence should be an affirmative sentence, not a negative sentence.
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [إِنَّ عَلِيًّا **لَمَا** حَضَرَ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/288]{.citex}

Instead, we should say (without the ;laam_ibt;):

(@) [إِنَّ عَلِيًّا مَا حَضَرَ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/288]{.citex}  
    [Indeed [#ealiyy]{.trn2} was not present.]{.trans}

Additionally, when the ;xabar; of ;inna; is a ;j_f3l; with a ;madi; verb, then the ;laam_ibt; cannot attached to the ;madi; verb.
But if [قَدْ]{.ar} is used before the ;madi; verb, then the ;laam_ibt; may be used.
So we cannot say:

(@) ;x; [إِنَّ الْعِلْمَ لَرَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/288]{.citex}  

But we can say:

(@) [إِنَّ الْعِلْمَ لَقَدْ رَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/288]{.citex}  
    [Indeed the knowledge -- it has raised the worth of its companion.]{.trans}  

Or we can say without both the ;laam_ibt; and [قَدْ]{.ar}

(@) ;x; [إِنَّ الْعِلْمَ رَفَعَ قَدْرَ صَاحِبِهِ]{.ar}
    [@nahw_arabi@ 1/288]{.citex}  
    [Indeed the knowledge -- it raised the worth of its companion.]{.trans}  

This restriction is not placed on a ;xabar which is a ;j_f3l; with a ;mudarie; verb.
So we can say:

(@) [إن زيدًا **ليخرج** اليوم]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd -- he will go out today.]{.trans}  

When the ;mudarie; verb has [سَوْفَ]{.ar},
then grammarians have disagreed with regards tp allowing ;laam_ibt; to attach to it.^[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/354](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1015#p1)]

(@) [إن زيدا **لسوفَ** يقوم]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/354](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1015#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd -- he will soon stand.]{.trans}

Also, ;ghair_mutasarrif; ;madi; verbs are exempted from being restricted and may be used with ;laam_ibt; directly.
For example:

(@) [إنّ زيدًا **لنِعْم** الرجلُ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd -- how excellent the man.]{.trans}  

(@) [إنّ عمرًا **لِبِئْسَ** الغلامُ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd -- how wretched the boy.]{.trans}  

However,
;laysa; is a ;ghair_mutasarrif; verb, but ;laam_ibt; does not attach to it because of the
undesirableness of two [ل]{.ar}s coming togather.
So we won't say:

(@) ;x; [إنّ زيدًا **لليس** بقائم]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/352](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1013)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd -- he is not standing.]{.trans}  

When a governee of the ;xabar; is placed before it in word order
(but still after the ;ism_of;),
such that it comes between the ;ism_of; and the ;xabar;,
then ;laam_ibt; will attach to the fronted governee, thus:

(@) [إنّ زيدًا **لَفِى الدار** قائمٌ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/354](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1015#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd, in the house is standing.]{.trans}  

<!--
(@) [إنك **لَعِندي** خطِي]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/354](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1015#p1)]{.citex}
-->

(@) [إن زيدًا **لطعامَكَ** آكلٌ]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/355](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1016#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd, your food he is eating.]{.trans}  

But if the governee of the ;xabar; is placed after the ;xabar; then the ;xabar; will have ;laam_ibt;, not its governee.
So we won't say:

(@) ;x; [إنَّ زيدًا آكلٌ **لطعامكَ**]{.ar}
    [[@sarraj_usool@ 2/235](https://shamela.ws/book/7365/739)]{.citex}  

Instead, we will say:

(@) [إنَّ زيدًا **لآكلٌ** طعامَكَ]{.ar}
    [[@sarraj_usool@ 2/235](https://shamela.ws/book/7365/739)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed Zayd is eating your food.]{.trans}  

Also, it the ;ism_of; has a ;na3t; which occurs between it and the ;xabar;,
then again ;laam_ibt; is placed with the ;xabar;.
For example:

(@) [إِنّ زيدًا الفاضِلَ **لَقَائِمٌ**]{.ar}
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/355](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1016#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed the excellent Zayd is standing]{.trans}  

### The ;laam_ibt; place before the ;ism_of; of ;inna;

So far, we have seen the ;laam_ibt; attached before the ;xabar; of ;inna;.
But,
if the ;xabar; occurs before the ;ism_of; in word order,
then ;laam_ibt; is actually atached before the ;ism_of;.
In this way, ;laam_ibt; again occurs between the ;ism_of; and the ;xabar;.
For example:

(@) [إن في الدار **لزيدا**]{.ar}
    [[@ibn_aqil_alfiyyah@ 1/373](https://shamela.ws/book/9904/372)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed in the house is Zayd.]{.trans}  

If the ;xabar; occurs after the ;ism_of; in word order,
but a governee of the ;xabar; occurs before the ;ism_of;,
then we have two options:
;laam_ibt; may optionally be attached before the ;ism_of; or before the ;xabar;.
For example:

(@) [إن فيها زيدًا **لقائم**]{.ar}  
    [إن فيها **لزيدًا** قائم]{.ar}  
    [[@shatibi_sharf_alfiyyah@ 2/357](https://shamela.ws/book/20562/1018#p1)]{.citex}  
    [Indeed in it Zayd is standing.]{.trans}  

## the lightened in, an, and laakin

### Differentiating between the lightened an and the ;masdar;i an

;anna;, like ;inna; essentially signifies an assertive meaning.

والذي تقرر عند أصحابنا أن شرط عمل هذا المصدر أن يقدر بحرف مصدري والفعل، فقدر الحرف س بـ"أن" الثقيلة المسندة إلى ضمير الشأن؛ لأنه يعم أن تكون الصلة ماضية وحالاً ومستقبلة، فتقدر في الماضي: من أنه ضرب زيد عمراً، وفي المضارع: من أنه يضرب؛ لأنه يصلح للحال والاستقبال.

وقدره بعضهم بـ"أن" الناصبة للفعل؛ لأن صلتها تكون بالماضي، نحو: عجبت من أن قام زيد، وبالمضارع فتخلصه للاستقبال، نحو: عجبت من أن يقوم زيد. وبـ"ما"؛ لأنها تصلح للحال، وتوصل به، نحو: عجبت مما تضرب زيداً.

قال الشارح: يريد أنّ "أن" الخفيفة ينسبك منها ومن الفعل الذي بعدها مصدرٌ، فيكون في موضع رفع بأنّه فاعلٌ، أو مبتدأٌ، أو في موضعِ نصب بأنّه مفعولٌ، أو في موضعِ مجرور بالإضافة.

فمثالُ كونها فاعلةً قولُك: "أعجبني أن قمتَ"، والمراد: قيامُك، وزمان ذلك المصدر المُضِيّ؛ لأن فعله الذي انسبك منه كان ماضيًا. وكذلك لو كان فعله مضارعًا، نحوَ قولك: "يسُرّني أن تُحسِن"، والمراد: إحسانُك، فهو مصدرٌ زمانُه المستقبل، أو الحال كما كان الفعلُ كذلك.
وتقول في المفعول: "كرِهتُ أن قمتَ"، أي: قيامَك، و"أكرَهُ أن تقوم".

وتقول في المجرور: "عجبتُ مِن أن قمتَ"، و"مِن أن تقوم".

ومجرَى و"أنْ" في ذلك مجرَى "أنَّ" المشدّدةِ، إذ كانت "أنَّ" مع اسمها وخبرها. في تأويلِ مصدر مشتقٍّ من لفظ خبرها. وتجري بوُجوه الإعراب على ما ذكرنا في "أن" المخفّفة، نحوَ قولك: "أعجبني أن تحسن"، أي: إحسانُك.

وقوله: "أن وما في حيّزها"، يريد: ما هو بعدها من تمامها، مأخوذٌ من "حيّزِ الدار"، وهو ما يتعلق بها من الحُقوق والمَرافِق، فاعرفه.
