# [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters {#inna-and-its-sisters}

## Introduction

In the basic ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence, both the ;mubtada; and the ;xabar; are in the ;ustate;. For example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{مُعَلِّمٌ} \txarb{ٱَلرَّجُلُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize comment};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=4.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The man is a teacher.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"This man is a teacher."

In the above sentence both the ;mubtada; [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar} "the man", and the ;xabar; [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} "a teacher" are in the ;ustate;. In this chapter we will study a family of particles, called
[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters,
that modify the ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence by placing the ;mubtada; in the a-state instead of the ;ustate;. For example,

[إِنَّ ٱلرَّجُلَ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
[Einna -rrajula mueallimun.]{.trn}  
"Indeed the man is a teacher."

Note how, in the above example, the ;mubtada; [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar} "the man" is now in the a-state. The ;xabar; [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} "a teacher" remains in the ;ustate;. 

The particles constituting the family of 
[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters
are:

1. [إِنَّ]{.ar}  [Einna]{.trn}     \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [أَنَّ]{.ar}  [Eanna]{.trn}     \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [كَأَنَّ]{.ar}  [kaEanna]{.trn}  \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar}  [lAkinna]{.trn} \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَيْتَ]{.ar}  [layta]{.trn}    \vphantom{\huge J}
1. [لَعَلَّ]{.ar}  [laealla]{.trn}  \vphantom{\huge J}

We shall now study each of these particles.

## [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn}

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is used to begin independent sentences. It has an emphatic meaning, as if the speaker is asserting the ;xabar; about the ;ismof;. It is often translated into English as "indeed" or "verily", but it is also often left untranslated.

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is only used to begin ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} directly. (Later, in section\ \@ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.). For example,

[إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِنْدَ ٱللَّـٰهِ ٱلْإِسْلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[Einna -ddIna einda -llAhi -lEislAmu.]{.trn}  
"Indeed, the religion in the sight of [_allAh]{.trn2} is [_islAm]{.trn2}." ([_qurEAn]{.trn2}\ 3:19, trans. Saheeh International)

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} 
may be preceded by other particles like [وَ]{.ar} "and", [فَ]{.ar} "so", and [ثُمَّ]{.ar} "then". For example,

[ٱُطْلُبِ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ. فَإِنَّ طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلنَّافِعَ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ. وَإِنَّ تَرْكَهُ غَفْلَةٌ.]{.ar}
"Seek the useful knowledge. For indeed the seeking of the useful knowledge is a good deed. And indeed leaving it is a negligence."

The ;ismof; of
[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} 
may be a noun phrase, in which case, any ;naat;s or replacements of the ;ismof; are also in the a-state. Examples:

[إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلَاءِ ٱلرِّجَالَ ٱلْكِرَامَ أَصْدِقَائِي.]{.ar}  
"Indeed these noble men are my friends."

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} may have multiple ;ismof;s, each in the a-state, separated by [وَ]{.ar}. Example,

[إِنَّ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَٱلْمُسْلِمَاتِ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱللَّـٰهَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed the Muslim men and Muslim women worship [_allAh]{.trn2}."

If the ;xabar; of the first ;ismof; has been mentioned before the second ;ismof;, then the second ;ismof; may optionally be in the a-state or the ;ustate;. For example:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرًا.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ وَعَمْرٌو.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is sitting and [_eamr]{.trn2} [as well]."

[إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَكَ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ لِي وَذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَاكُ لَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed this book is for me and that book is for you."

[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} may be used to begin sentences with an indefinite ;ismof;. For example,

[إِنَّ مَلِكًا مِنَ ٱلْهِنْدِ كَتَبَ إِلَىٰ أَحَدِ وُزَرَائِهِ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed a king from India wrote to one of his ministers."

Note that in all the above examples that
[إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} is only used to begin ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentences. Verbal sentences cannot be introduced by [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} directly. (Later, in section\ \@ref(damiir-al-shan), we shall see how to overcome this restriction.).
By default, the ;ismof; of [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} must directly follow it with no intervening words or particles. The only exception is when the ;xabar; consists of a prepositional or adverbial phrase, it is then allowed to precede the ;ismof;. The ;ismof;, in any case, shall be in the a-state. For example,

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ رَجُلًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the house, is a man."

[إِنَّ تَحْتَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ كَنْزًا ثَمِينًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, under the tree, is a precious treasure."

This reverse order is permitted even when the ;ismof; is definite. For example,

[إِنَّ مَعَكَ صَاحِبَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, with you, is _your companion_."

This puts the logical accent on the ;ismof; [صَاحِبَكَ]{.ar} "your companion". If the ;ismof; is placed first then this puts the logical accent on the ;xabar;:

[إِنَّ صَاحِبَكَ مَعَكَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed your companion is _with_ you."

If the ;ismof; contains a pronoun that refers to a noun in the ;xabar; then the ;xabar; must precede the ;ismof;. For example,

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْمَصْنَعِ عُمَّالَهُ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the factory, are its workers."

[إِنَّ أَمَامَ ٱلدَّارِ حَارِسَهَا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in front of the door, is its guard."

### Pronoun ;ismof;s

<!--In the examples above, the ;ismof; of [إِنَّ]{.ar} has been a noun. -->
The ;ismof; of [إِنَّ]{.ar} may be a pronoun instead of a noun. For this the attached pronouns are used. For example,

[لَا تَقْطَعْ تِلْكَ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَإِنَّهَا ظَلِيلَةٌ.]{.ar}  
"Don't cut that tree, for it is shady."

[إِنَّكُمَا صَدِيقَايَ.]{.ar}  
"You~2~ are my friends."

The speaker pronouns, both singular and plural, may optionally keep or drop their [ن]{.ar}. 
So for the singular speaker pronoun both [إِنَّنِي]{.ar} [EinnanI]{.trn} and [إِنِّي]{.ar} [EinnI]{.trn} may be used.
And for the plural speaker pronoun both [إِنَّنَا]{.ar} [EinnanA]{.trn} and [إِنَّا]{.ar} [EinnA]{.trn} may be used.
Examples:

[إِنِّي مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّنِي مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed I am a Muslim."

[إِنَّنَا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
or  
[إِنَّا كَاتِبُو هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed we are the writers of this book."

TODO: Multiple pronoun ;ismof;s: [إِنِّ وَ إِيَّاكَ ...]{.ar}

[إِنَّ]{.ar} with the speaker pronouns are often used with ;ismfail;s to signify that the speaker intends to to the action of the verb. For example,

[إِنِّي ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ.]{.ar}  
"I'm going to the mosque."

We also mentioned this point in section\ \@ref(;ismfail;-for-intended-future-action).

### [إِنَّ]{.ar} [Einna]{.trn} with a strengthening [لَ]{.ar} {#inna-strengthening-la}

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar} adds extra emphasis and may optionally be used between the ;ismof; of [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its ;xabar;.
If the ;ismof; occurs first (as is the default) then [لَ]{.ar} is connected to and placed directly before the ;xabar;. For example:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is definitely standing."

If the ;xabar; precedes the ;ismof;, then then [لَ]{.ar} is connected to and placed directly before the ;ismof;. For example:

[إِنَّ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ لَرَجُلًا.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, in the house, is definitely a man."

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar} is only used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and not for any of its other sisters
([إِنَّ]{.ar},
[أَنَّ]{.ar},
[كَأَنَّ]{.ar},
[لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar},
[لَيْتَ]{.ar}, and
[لَعَلَّ]{.ar}).

### Commonality of rules for [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters

Unless otherwise noted, the rules we have presented above for 
[إِنَّ]{.ar},
for example, the ;ismof; being in the a-state, the order of the ;ismof; and the ;xabar;, the use of attached pronouns for the ;ismof;, etc.,
apply also to its other sisters. 

The strengthening particle [لَ]{.ar}, as mentioned above, is only used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and not for any of its other sisters.

## [أَنَّ]{.ar} [Eanna]{.trn}

The particle 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} [Eanna]{.trn}
can be translated as "that".
It is similar to [إِنَّ]{.ar} in that it is asserts the ;xabar; about the ;ismof;.
But 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} is different from [إِنَّ]{.ar} in that [إِنَّ]{.ar}, its ;ismof;, and its ;xabar; together constitute a complete sentence.
Whereas 
the
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
([أَنَّ]{.ar}
, its ;ismof;, and its ;xabar; together) does not constitute a complete sentence. For example, consider the expression:

[زَيْدٌ صَادِقٌ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd is truthful."

This is a complete sentence. But if we add 
[أَنَّ]{.ar} "that" to its beginning, it no longer remains a complete sentence:

[أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ]{.ar}  
"that Zayd is truthful"

We need to additional words, external to the 
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
to complete the sentence. We will see examples of this below.

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the ;mafulb;

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ} \txarb{أَعْلَمُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize ;mafulb;};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I know that Zayd is truthful.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"I know that Zayd is truthful."

Note how, in the example above the 
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clause
([أَنَّ زَيْدًا صَادِقٌ]{.ar})
has occupied the place of the ;mafulb; of the verb [أَعْلَمُ]{.ar}.

In a similar manner,
[أَنَّ]{.ar}
clauses can be placed where one would expect other noun positions, such as: a ;mubtada;, an ;xabar;, a ;fail;, and more. Here are some examples:

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the ;fail;

Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّكَ مَرِيضٌ} \txarb{بَلَغَنِي},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize doer};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``That you are sick has reached me.'' (``It has reached me that you are sick.'')};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"That you are sick has reached me." ("It has reached me that you are sick.")

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the ;mubtada;

Example (with ;xabar; before ;mubtada; in sentence word order):

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ} \txarb{مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``From his characteristics is that he is noble.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"From his characteristeics is that he is noble."

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of the ;xabar;

Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ ذَهَبَ} \txarb{ٱَلْحَقُّ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize comment};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The truth is that he went."

### [أَنَّ]{.ar} with [كَانَ]{.ar}

As you know, [كَانَ]{.ar}'s ;fail; is also its ;ismof;, and its ;mafulb; is also its ;xabar;.
The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in either the ;ismof; or the ;xabar; of [كَنَ]{.ar}. 
For example, the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause as the ;xabar;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَفْعَلْ وَاجِبَهُ} \txarb{كَانَ ٱلْأَمْرُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize comment};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The matter was that he didn't do his obligation."

Now, the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause as the ;ismof;:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَفْعَلْ وَاجِبَهُ} \txarb{كَانَ ٱلْأَمْرَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize subject};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"That he didn't do his obligation was the matter."

Note that in the latter case, the ;xabar; precedes the ;ismof;.

### The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause in place of an i-state noun

The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in place of an i-state ;mudafil; in an ;idafa;. Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ ٱلسَّفَرَ خَطِرٌ} \txarb{كَثُرَ قَاطِعُو ٱلطَّرِيقِ لِدَرَجَةِ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize ;mudafil;};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The highway robbers (literally: the cutters of the way) have increased to the degree that the journey is dangerous."

The [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause can occur in place of an i-state  noun directly following a preposition. Example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{أَنَّ زَيْدًا نَائِمٌ} \txarb{عَجِبْتُ مِنْ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, below] {\scriptsize i-state after preposition};

%\path (0,0) node [midway, below=8ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``The truth is that he went.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"I wondered at that Zayd is asleep."

#### Optionally deleting the preposition directlt before an [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause

If an
[أَنَّ]{.ar} clause
directly follows a preposition, it is permissible to optionally delete the preposition as long as the meaning remains clear.
So the previous example can be expressed without the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} with the same meaning:

[عَجِبْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا نَائِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at that Zayd is asleep."

#### [لِأَنَّ]{.ar} "because"

The combination of the preposition [لِ]{.ar} "for" and [أَنَّ]{.ar} is used to mean "because". For example,

[أَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لِأَنَّنِي كُنْتُ جَائِعًا.]{.ar}  
"I ate the food because I was hungry."

### Equivalence of the [أَنَّ]{.ar} clause with a ;masdar;

As a matter of grammatical theory, the
[أَنَّ]{.ar} clause, i.e. ([أَنَّ]{.ar} itself, its ;ismof;, and its ;xabar;) is considered equivalent to a ;masdar; (typically in an ;idafa;, and possibly with a ;mafulb; as well). It is this equivalence that allows it to thake the place of a ;fail;, ;mafulb;, and the other categories we have given above.
For instance, consider the example:

[عَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at that Zayd went."

Here, the clause
[أَنَّ زَيْدًا ذَهَب]{.ar}
is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase [ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ]{.ar} "Zayd's going". So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:

[عَجِبْتُ مِنْ ذَهَابِ زَيْدٍ.]{.ar}  
"I wondered at Zayd's going."

Similarly, in the example,

[مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
"From his characteristics is that he is generous."

the clause
[أَنَّهُ كَرِيمٌ]{.ar}
is equivalent to the verbal noun phrase [كَرَامَتِهِ]{.ar} "his generosity". So the grammatically equivalent sentence with this verbal noun phrase is:

[كَرَامَتِهِ مِنْ صِفَاتِهِ.]{.ar}  
"His generosity is from his characteristics."

This grammatical equivalence is more a matter of theory than of practical usefulness to us.
And you have seen this grammatical equivalence before with [أَنْ]{.ar} and a-state ;mudarie; verbs in chanpter\ \@ref(a-state-;mudarie;-verbs-verbal-noun).

## [كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}

[كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}
may be translated as "[It is] as if".
It is actually simply the preposition [كَ]{.ar} "like" attached to [أَنَّ]{.ar}. But it is treated separately because, unlike [أَنَّ]{.ar},
[كَأَنَّ]{.ar} [kaEanna]{.trn}, its ;ismof;, and its ;xabar; constitute a complete sentence. For example,

[كَأَنَّ ٱلْأُمُّ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
"[It is] as if the mother is a school."

## The ;xabar; as a complete sentence and the pronoun of the fact

### The ;xabar; as a complete sentence

There is a sub-type of ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence
where the ;xabar; is a complete sentence.
Here is an example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{فُرُوعُها طَوِيلَةٌ} \txarb{ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize subject};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate]

"The tree: its branches are long."

In these kinds of sentences, the ;mubtada; introduces a topic, and the ;xabar; is itself a sentence which comments on the topic/;mubtada;.
We have, in fact, already seen sentences like this in section\ \@ref(past-verbs-order-of-words), when we take a verbal sentence and convert it to a ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence. This is the example we discussed there:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
"The man: he wrote a book."

#### The linker pronoun

A ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence,
in which the ;xabar; is itself a sentence;
typically requires a pronoun in the ;xabar; that links back to the ;mubtada;. 
In the example
[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُفُرُوعُهَا طَوِيلَةٌ.]{.ar}, the attached pronoun [هَا]{.ar} "it" in [فُرُوعُهَا]{.ar} "its tree" is the linker pronoun that links back to the ;ismof; [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} "the tree".

Similarly, in the example
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}
the linker pronoun is the invisible ;fail; pronoun "he" of the verb [كَتَبَ]{.ar} "he wrote" that links back to the ;ismof; [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} "the man".

#### ;_mubtada;-;xabar; sentences with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters

[إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters are very often used in ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentences. (With [أَنَّ]{.ar} it is, as usual, an incomplete sentence.) Here are some examples:

[إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَهُ أَخٌ وَأُخْتٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd: he has a brother and sister."

[ٱِعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱلْعِلْمَ حُصُولُهُ يَتَطَلَّبُ جُهْدًا.]{.ar}  
"Know that knowledge: its obtaining requires effort."

#### ;_mubtada;-;xabar; sentences with a pronoun ;ismof;

The ;ismof;, in a ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence, is frequently a pronoun. For example,

[أَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I: my name is Zayd."

[أَكَلْتُ ٱلطَّعَامَ لَـٰكِنَّكَ لَمْ تَأْكُلْ.]{.ar}  
"I ate the food but you: you didn't eat."

### The pronoun of the fact

Mostly, pronouns are used in place of nouns when it is already known to whom the noun refers to. So if you say:

[أَنَا ٱسْمِي زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I: my name is Zayd."

the pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} "I" refers to the speaker, who is known.

There is a special pronoun, called the _pronoun of the fact_ that begins ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentences. This pronoun does not refer to any previously known entity, but rather refers to the ;xabar; that follows it. It is sometimes translated as "the fact is" but is often left untranslated. Here is an example:

```{.tikzarabic}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=1.45ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ} \txarb{هُوَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize pronoun of the fact};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex] {\scriptsize comment};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

"The fact is: the cold is intense."

This pronoun is usually the singular masculine pronoun (as above) but it is also sometimes the singular feminine pronoun [هِيَ]{.ar}.
It is typically used with statements of import, to which the speaker wishes to draw attention.
The ;xabar; does not contain a linker pronoun because the whole ;xabar; refers back to the ;ismof;.
The pronoun of the fact is frequently used with [إِنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters. 
Here are some examples:

[إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed."  
([_qurEAn]{.trn2} 23:117, trans. Saheeh International)

Sometimes, one can choose between using the pronoun of the fact and a pronoun matching the participant resulting in different emphasis. For example,

[إِنِّهُ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ]{.ar}  
"Indeed, the fact is: they are the doers."

[إِنِّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَاعِلُونَ]{.ar}  
"Indeed, _they_ are the doers."

## The lightened versions [إِنْ]{.ar}, [أَنْ]{.ar}, [كَأَنْ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}

The particles [إِنَّ]{.ar}, [أَنَّ]{.ar}, [كَأَنَّ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar}, because of the doubled [نّ]{.ar} are considered _heavy_.
There exist _lightened_ versions of these particles that are:
[إِنْ]{.ar}, [أَنْ]{.ar}, [كَأَنْ]{.ar}, and [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}.
These lightened versions have similar meanings to their heavy counterparts but they have somewhat different rules. We will discuss them below.
In terms of their usage 
[إِنْ]{.ar} and
[كَأَنْ]{.ar} are not very commonly used except in the [_qurEAn]{.trn2}, poetry, and other rhetorical texts.
[أَنْ]{.ar} and
[لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}
are relatively more common.

### The lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}

The lightened
[إِنْ]{.ar}
can be used in either of the following ways:

 i. With the same rules as the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}. The ;ismof; is put in the a-state and the use of the strengthening [لَ]{.ar} is optional. For example,

    [إِنْ زَيْدًا مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
    or  
    [إِنْ زَيْدًا لَمُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
    "Indeed Zayd is a Muslim."

    However, this method is not as common as the second way (below):


ii. The ;ismof; is not put in the a-state but is rather in the ;ustate;.
    However, the strengthening [لَ]{.ar} (see section\ \@ref(inna-strengthening-la) above), that was optional with the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}, is now mandatory with the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}. For example,

    [إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
    "Indeed Zayd is a Muslim."

Another notable difference between 
the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}
and
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}
is that 
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar} is only used to introduce ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentences.
The lightened [إِنْ]{.ar},
however, can be used to introduce verbal sentences, but only those that begin with the verbs:
[كَانَ]{.ar} and its sisters,
[كَادَ]{.ar} and its sisters, and
[ظَنَّ]{.ar} and its sisters.
For example,

[قَرَأْتُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَإِنْ كَانَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَجَيِّدًا.]{.ar}  
"I read the book and indeed the book was good."

<!--
The second, less common way, of using
the lightened [إِنْ]{.ar}
is following the same rules as the 
the heavy [إِنَّ]{.ar}.
Where the ;ismof; is in the a-state and the use of the strengthening [لَ]{.ar} is optional. For example,

[إِنْ زَيْدًا مُسْلِمٌ.]{.ar}  
"Indeed Zayd is a Muslim."
-->

### The lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} {#lightened-an}

As we know, the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} is an emphatic particle and is frequently used with the pronoun of the fact, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the fact is: the cold is intense."

When we wish not to use much emphasis, we may replace
the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} along with its following pronoun of the fact ([أَنَّهُ]{.ar}/[أَنَّهَا]{.ar}) with
a lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the cold is intense."

Note that
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} replaces 
[أَنَّهُ]{.ar},
which is the combination of
heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} _and_ the pronoun of the fact [هُ]{.ar}.
So the pronoun of the fact ([هُ]{.ar}) does not appear with
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}.

<!--
The combination of a heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} with a following pronoun of the fact ([أَنَّهُ]{.ar}/[أَنَّهَا]{.ar}) may be replaced with
a lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}. 
The pronoun of the fact ([هُ]{.ar}/[هَا]{.ar}) is then deleted.

only introduces ;mubtada;-;xabar; clauses whose ;ismof; is understood to be a deleted pronoun of the fact. 
The lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} only introduces ;mubtada;-;xabar; clauses whose ;ismof; is understood to be a deleted pronoun of the fact. 
The ;xabar; is, as usual, a complete sentence. 
For example, consider the following sentence with a heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar}:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the fact is: the cold is intense."

If we replace the heavy [أَنَّ]{.ar} in the above example with the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} then we pronoun of the fact ;ismof; is deleted, thus:

[أَعْلَمُ أَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدٌ.]{.ar}  
"I know that the cold is intense."
-->

In the above example, 
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
introduces a ;xabar; which is a ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence.
But the more common use of 
the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
is to introduce ;xabar;s that are verbal sentences.

When the ;xabar; of the 
lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}
is a verbal sentence, then it is  preferred to separate the verb from [أَنْ]{.ar} with one of the following:

1. [قَدْ]{.ar}. Example:
   
   [أَظُنُّ أَنْ قَدْ غَرَبَتِ ٱلشَّمْسُ.]{.ar}  
   "I think that the sun has set."

2. [سَ]{.ar} or [سَوْفَ]{.ar}. Example:

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ سَيَذْهَبُ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he will go."

3. A negative particle like [لَا]{.ar}, [لَنْ]{.ar}, or [لَمْ]{.ar}.

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَا يَذْهَبُ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he does/will not go."

   Note that, in writing, we have not combined the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and [لَا]{.ar} to form [أَلَّا]{.ar}, as is done for the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} (for example: [أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ]{.ar} "that he not go") in chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-;mudarie;-verbs). This distinction in spelling is not obligatory, but some authorities recommend it. In any case, they are both pronounced the same: [EallA]{.trn}. <!--al nahw al wafi 4/298, cited by Arik Sadan p.30 -->

   More examples:

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَنْ يَذْهَبَ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he shall not go."

   [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ لَمْ يَذْهَبْ.]{.ar}  
   "I know that he did not go."

   Note that the [لَنْ]{.ar} and [لَمْ]{.ar}, even when after the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, change the state of the following ;mudarie; verb to the a-state and 0-state respectively.

4. The conditional particle [لَوْ]{.ar}. We will study conditional sentences in chapter\ \@ref(conditional-sentences). TODO: add example.

Rigid verbs like [لَيْسَ]{.ar} and verbs expressing supplications are exempted from needing to be separated from the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}. Example:

[ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ لَيْسَ ٱلْبَرْدُ شَدِيدًا.]{.ar}  
"I thought that the cold is not intense."

#### Distinguishing between the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} 

Although they are similar in meaning,
care must be taken to distinguish between this lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} and the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} 
(that we learned in chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-;mudarie;-verbs)),
The a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} puts the following ;mudarie; verb in the a-state.
Whereas the ;mudarie; verb directly after the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} remains in the ;ustate;.
The following guidelines can help to distinguish  between these two [أَنْ]{.ar}s:

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} signifies certainty then only [أَنَّ]{.ar} and its lightened version [أَنْ]{.ar} is used. For example,

  [أَعْلَمُ أَنْ قَدْ ذَهَبَ وَأَنْ سَيَرْجِعُ.]{.ar}  
  "I know that he has gone and that he will return."

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} signifies wanting, hoping, or expecting, then the [أَنْ]{.ar} puts the following verb in the a-state. For example,

  [أَطْمَعُ أَلَّا يَذْهَبَ.]{.ar}  
  "I hope that he not go."

  Note that the verb [يَذْهَبَ]{.ar} is in the a-state.

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} reflects a view of something going to occur, and signifies neither certainty nor expectation, but rather doubt or neutrality, then either of the [أَنْ]{.ar}s may be used, depending on the intended meaning. Such verbs include [ظَنَّ يَظُنُّ]{.ar} "to think" and [حَسِبَ يَحْسِبُ]{.ar} "to deem". For example,

  a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar}:  
  [ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعَ.]{.ar}  
  "I thought that he should return."  

  lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}:  
  [ظَنَنْتُ أَنْ يَرْجِعُ.]{.ar}  
  "I thought that he will return."

+ If the verb before [أَنْ]{.ar} does not reflect a view of something going to occur then the [أَنْ]{.ar} is typically the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar}. For example,

  [سَرَّنِي أَنْ تَنْجَحَ]{.ar}  
  "That you succeed [will have] gladdened me."

  Remember from chapter\ \@ref(chapter-a-state-;mudarie;-verbs)), that the a-state-verbal [أَنْ]{.ar} can occur with ;madi; verbs as well. Example:

  [سَرَّنِي أَنْ نَجَحْتَ]{.ar}  
  "That you have succeeded [has] gladdened me."

### The lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar}

The lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar} is similar to the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar} in that it introduces a ;mubtada;-;xabar; sentence and the ;ismof; is usually a deleted pronoun of the fact. For example,

[كَأَنِ ٱلْبَرْدُ ذَهَبَ.]{.ar}  
"[It is] as if the cold has gone."

Also similar to the lightened [أَنْ]{.ar}, the lightened [كَأَنْ]{.ar} may introduce a verbal sentence but it must be separated from [كَأَنْ]{.ar} by either [قَدْ]{.ar} or [لَمْ]{.ar}. For example,

[ذَهَبَ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَسْمَعْ.]{.ar}  
"He went as if he did not hear."

### The lightened [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar}

The lightened [لَـٰكِنْ]{.ar} has the same meaning as the heavy [لَـٰكِنَّ]{.ar} but it has no grammatical effect on the word or sentence after it. It may introduce either ;mubtada;-;xabar; or verbal sentences. For example,

[نَجَحَ زَيْدٌ لَـٰكِنْ صَدِيقُهُ لَمْ يَنْجَحْ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd succeeded but his friend did not succeed."
