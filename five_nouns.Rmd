# The five nouns

There are five nouns in Arabic which behave a little different than other nouns in how they show their state.

We have learned that nouns have three states: the u-state, a-state, and i-state. For singular nouns, the u-state is marked by the [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}, the a-state is marked by the [a]{.trn}-mark [◌َ]{.ar}, and the i-state is marked by the [i]{.trn}-mark [◌ِ]{.ar}. The [n]{.trn}-marks [◌ٌ]{.ar}, [◌ً]{.ar} and [◌ٍ]{.ar} are only but extensions of [◌ُ]{.ar}, [◌َ]{.ar}, and [◌ِ]{.ar} respectively.
