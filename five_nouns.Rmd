# The five nouns

There are five nouns in Arabic which behave a little different than other nouns in how they show their state.

We have learned that nouns have three states: the u-state, a-state, and i-state. For singular nouns, the u-state is marked by the [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}, the a-state is marked by the [a]{.trn}-mark [◌َ]{.ar}, and the i-state is marked by the [i]{.trn}-mark [◌ِ]{.ar}. The [n]{.trn}-marks [◌ٌ]{.ar}, [◌ً]{.ar} and [◌ٍ]{.ar} are only but extensions of [◌ُ]{.ar}, [◌َ]{.ar}, and [◌ِ]{.ar} respectively.

We now present the five special nouns that behave differently.

## [أَبٌ]{.ar} [Eabun]{.trn}, [أَخٌ]{.ar} [Eaxun]{.trn}, and [حَمٌ]{.ar} [Hamun]{.trn}

The first three nouns that we will talk about are 

1.  [أَبٌ]{.ar} [Eabun]{.trn} "father"
2.  [أَخٌ]{.ar} [Eaxun]{.trn} "brother"
3.  [حَمٌ]{.ar} [Hamun]{.trn} "father-in-law"

In many respects, these nouns show their state like every other noun. Here are some examples:

[حَضَرَ أَخٌ فَسَأَلْتُ ٱلْأَخَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ وَشَكَرْتُ لِلْأَخِ.]{.ar}  
[HaDara Eaxun fasaEaltu -lEaxa ean Eamrin wa cakartu lilEaxi.]{.trn}  
"A brother was present, so I asked  the brother about a matter, and I thanked the brother."

[أَمَرَ ٱلرَّجُلُ أَخًا بِاٱلْعَمَلِ فَعَمِلَ ٱلْأَخُ.]{.ar}  
"The man ordered a brother to work, so the brother worked."

[أَبٌ]{.ar} [Eabun]{.trn} "father" and [حَمٌ]{.ar} [Hamun]{.trn} "father-in-law" behave exactly the same as well.

Where the nouns behave differently is when they are the first noun in a noun-chain. Then instead of showing their state with [◌ُ]{.ar}, [◌َ]{.ar}, and [◌ِ]{.ar}, they show their state using the long vowels [و]{.ar} [U]{.trn}, [ا]{.ar} [A]{.trn}, and [ي]{.ar} [I]{.trn} instead. Here are some examples:

[زَيدٌ أَخُو عَمْرٍو.]{.ar}  
[zaydun EaxU eamrin.]{.trn}  
"Zayd is [e#amr]{.trn2}'s brother."

[سَأَلْتُ أَبَا غُلَامِ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
[saEaltu EabA gulAmin ean Eamrin.]{.trn}  
"I asked a boy's father about a matter."

[شَكَرْتُ لِحَمِي زَيْدٍ.]{.ar}  
[cakartu liHamI zaydin.]{.trn}  
"I thanked Zayd's father-in-law."
