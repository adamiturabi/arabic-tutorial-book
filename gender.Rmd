# Gender

All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. Sometimes the nouns designate living beings, like "man", "woman", "human", "bull", "cow", "teacher", "student", etc.

Other times, the nouns designate inanimate objects. 

There are other nouns that are more descriptive meaning and are often used as description words, like "a big [person or thing]", "a happy [person]", etc.

To deal with the gender of these different kinds of nouns, we'll classify nouns into:

1. _Rigid_ nouns: In rigid nouns, we generally cannot modify the masculine noun to obtain the feminine noun.
2. _Flexible_ nouns: In flexible nouns, we can generally modify the masculine noun to obtain the feminine noun.

## Rigid nouns

These include:

1. Nouns for living beings that are male and female. The grammatical gender of the noun usually matches the gender of the living being. Here are some examples:

Let's note a few things:

+ The feminine noun usually ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, which is a feminine marker for singular nouns (but not for plural nouns which we'll learn in the next chapter, if Allah wills). This looped [tAE]{.trn} is the most common feminine marker. There are a couple of other feminine markers that are not very common. We will learn those later, if Allah wills.

+ There are a few feminine nouns that don't end with looped [tAE]{.trn}, like [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} "a mother", [شَمْسٌ]{.ar} [camsun]{.trn} "a sun". Only a few of these are commonly used so they will not be too hard to learn, if Allah wills. Of these are parts of the body that occur in pairs like eyes, hand, and legs. These are mostly feminine, even if they don't have a feminine marker. 

+ The feminine noun is sometimes fomed by adding the looped [tAE]{.trn} to the masculine noun like mar', kalb. Other times, the feminine noun is completely different, like bull, cow. Because of this, we won't assume that we can generally form a feminine to a rigid noun by adding the feminine marker.

+ Animals often have different words for the male animal and the female animal, like [أَسَدٌ]{.ar} [Easadun]{.trn} "a lion", [لَبْوَةٌ]{.ar} [labwatun]{.trn}"a lioness", [ثَوْرٌ]{.ar} [vawrun]{.trn} "a bull", [بَقَرَةٌ]{.ar} [baqaratun]{.trn} "a cow". This is often the case when the make and female animal are visually or agriculturally distinct.

  Other times, the same noun is often used to refer to both the male and female animal, like [قِرْدٌ]{.ar} [qirdun]{.trn} "a monkey", [حَمَامَةٌ]{.ar} [HamAmatun]{.trn} "a pigeon". 
  
+ There are some nouns for living beings that don't have different masculine and feminine nouns. These nouns can be used for both male and female living beings even though the noun is itself only of one grammatical gender. For example, [شَخْصٌ]{.ar} [caxSun]{.trn} is a masculine noun which means "a person". But it can be used to refer to both a man and a woman. 

  Remember that we cannot modify rigid nouns by adding a feminine marker like looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to it. So when [شَخْصٌ]{.ar} [caxSun]{.trn} is used to refer to a female person, we can't modify it to [شَخْصَةٌ]{.ar} [caxSatun]{.trn} because this word does not exist.

  Similarly [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn} is a masculine noun which means "an animal" but it can be used to refer to both male and female animals without modifying it. 

+ Even when there are different words for the male and female living beings, one of them is often commonly used to refer to both the male and female animal. For example, [كَلْبٌ]{.ar} [kalbun]{.trn} is "a male dog" and  [كَلْبَةٌ]{.ar} [kalbatun]{.trn} is "a female dog". But commonly, [كَلْبٌ]{.ar} [kalbun]{.trn} is used to refer to both a male and a female dog. 

  Similarly [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} is commonly used to refer to both a female and a male cat, even though the word [هِرٌّ]{.ar} exists. And [طِفْلٌ]{.ar} [Tiflun]{.trn} "a male child" is commonly used to refer to both a male and a female child, even though the word [طِفْلَةٌ]{.ar} [Tiflatun]{.trn} exists. [إِنْسَانٌ]{.ar} [EinsAnun]{.trn} "a human" is also one of these words. (The word [إِنْسَانَةٌ]{.ar} [EinsAnatun]{.trn} "a female human" exists but it is very rarely used.)

  So how do we know when a rigid noun is commonly used to refer to both male and female living beings? There are not very many of these nouns and we have already listed the most common ones: [شَخْصٌ، إِنْسَانٌ، طِفْلٌ، كَلْبٌ، هِرَّةٌ]{.ar}. When we come across another such noun, we will note it in the vocabulary.

+ There are two words for man. Note also that wehen we make the noun by adding al...

## Some notes about rigid and flexible nouns

Rigid nouns are often primitive, or they are words for concepts.

Flexible nouns are usually based on some characteristic of the object.

Description words are usually from flexible nouns.


## In a later chapter:

Some flexible nouns become commonly used as words that designate specific things. 

Sometimes they may be inanimate objects like, e.g. naSIHah advice, muSIbah calamity.

Other times they are persons of only one gender, e.g., jAriyah girl. 

These now behave like rigid nouns in that we can not add or remove the feminine marker.

There are also other flexible nouns used as words that designate persons of both gender like mueallim, mueallimah.

Some rigid nouns can be used as description words like xAm "a raw material".
