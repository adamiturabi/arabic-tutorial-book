# Gender

All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. Sometimes the nouns designate animate beings like "a man", "a woman", "a dog", "a cow", "a teacher", etc.

Other nouns designate inanimate objects like "a book", "a house", "a hand", "a tree", "a city", "a food". In Arabic these nouns too will be grammatically either masculine or feminine.

## Nouns that designate animate beings.

In Arabic sometimes for nouns that designate animate beings, the masculine and feminine nouns look similar. Here are some examples:

Arabic word | Transcription|Gender | Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:---|:----------------
[ٱِمْرَؤٌ]{.ar} |[imraEun]{.trn}     |masc.|a man
[ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar}|[imraEatun]{.trn}   |fem. |a woman
//[طِفْلٌ]{.ar}  |[Tiflun]{.trn}    |masc.|a male child
//[طِفْلَةٌ]{.ar} |[Tiflatun]{.trn}  |fem. |a female child
[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} |[mueallimun]{.trn}  |masc.|a male teacher
[مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar}|[mueallimatun]{.trn}|fem. |a female teacher
[كَلْبٌ]{.ar}  |[kalb]{.trn}        |masc.|a male dog
[كَلْبَةٌ]{.ar} |[kalbatun]{.trn}    |fem. |a female dog
[هِرٌّ]{.ar}   |[hirrun]{.trn}      |masc.|a male cat
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar}  |[hirratun]{.trn}    |fem. |a female cat

In each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun. For example, [ٱِمْرَوٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn} is "a man" and [ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar} [imraEatun]{.trn} is "a woman".

Note that when we add looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to a noun, the [n]{.trn}-mark is transferred to the looped [tAE]{.trn} and the previous letter gets an [a]{.trn}-mark. In the case of [ٱِمْرَأَةٌ]{.ar} [imraEatun]{.trn} the previous letter is a [hamza]{.trn} that was seated on a [wAw]{.trn} in [ٱِمْرَوٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn} and we have to change its seat to [alif]{.trn} when we replace the [un]{.trn}-mark with an [a]{.trn}-mark.

The looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} is called a feminine marker. It is the most common feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other feminine markers besides looped [tAE]{.trn} but they are not as common and we will learn them later if Allah wills.
 
Also, we have already learned another word for "a man": [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}. So what is difference between [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} and [ٱِمْرَؤٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn}.
The noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} is used more commonly when talking about specific male human beings.
[ٱِمْرَؤٌ]{.ar} [imraEun]{.trn} is used generally when speaking about "man" generically, for example, in sentences like "Man is a social animal." and "A man should always be honest."

For other nouns that designate animate beings, the masculine and feminine nouns are completely different. Here are some examples:

Arabic word | Transcription|Gender | Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:---|:----------------
[أَبٌ]{.ar}   |[Eabun]{.trn}     |masc.|a father
[أُمٌّ]{.ar}   |[Eummun]{.trn}    |fem. |a mother
[غُلَامٌ]{.ar} |[gulAmun]{.trn}   |masc.|a boy
[جَارِيَةٌ]{.ar}|[jAriyatun]{.trn} |fem. |a girl
[أَسَدٌ]{.ar}  |[Easadun]{.trn}   |masc.|a lion
[لَبْوَةٌ]{.ar} |[labwatun]{.trn}  |fem. |a lioness
[ثَوْرٌ]{.ar}  |[vawrun]{.trn}    |masc.|a bull
[بَقَرَةٌ]{.ar} |[baqaratun]{.trn} |fem. |a cow

Even in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don't end with a feminine marker like looped [tAE]{.trn}. [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} "a mother" is one of them.

//Also note that some animals have different words for the male and the female animal, like 
//[ثَوْرٌ]{.ar} [vawrun]{.trn} "a bull"
//and
//[بَقَرَةٌ]{.ar} [baqaratun]{.trn} "a cow".

There are other nouns that designate animate beings that use the same word for both sexes. The word itself will be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:

Arabic word | Transcription|Gender | Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:---|:----------------
[إِنْسَانٌ]{.ar}|[EinsAnun]{.trn}  |masc.|a human
[شَخْصٌ]{.ar}  |[caxSun]{.trn}    |masc.|a person
[نَفْسٌ]{.ar}  |[nafsun]{.trn}    |fem. |a self
[حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}|[HayawAnun]{.trn} |masc.|an animal
[طَائِرٌ]{.ar} |[TAEirun]{.trn}   |masc.|a bird
[قِرْدٌ]{.ar}  |[qirdun]{.trn}    |masc.|a monkey
[حَمَامَةٌ]{.ar}|[HamAmatun]{.trn} |fem. |a pigeon

So for example [قِرْدٌ]{.ar} [qirdun]{.trn} "a monkey" is grammatically masculine but it can be used for both a male and a female monkey.

By the way, even when the male and female animal have different words, sometimes one of them is used commonly for animals of either sex when we are not concerned with the actual sex of the animal. For example 
[كَلْبٌ]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} "a male dog" is used commonly for "a dog" and
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat" is used commonly for "a cat".

Similarly [إِنْسَانٌ]{.ar} [EinsAnun]{.trn} "a human" is grammatically masculine but it can be used for both male and female human beings.

It can be a little tricky using a masculine noun for a female animate being, and vice versa. So, if Allah wills, we will learn how to deal with these nouns in detail.

Note also that [نَفْسٌ]{.ar} [nafsun]{.trn} "a self" is a feminine noun but it does not end in a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that have a female marker. We have already seen two such nouns earlier:

+ [شَمْسٌ]{.ar} [camsun]{.trn} (fem.) "a sun"
+ [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} (fem.) "a mother"

## Nouns that designate inanimate objects

Nouns that designate inanimate objects are also assigned a gender arbitrarily. Here are some examples:

Arabic word | Transcription|Gender | Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:---|:----------------
[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} |[kitAbun]{.trn}   |masc.|a book
[بَيْتٌ]{.ar}  |[baytun]{.trn}    |masc.|a house
[قَلَمٌ]{.ar}  |[qalamun]{.trn}   |masc.|a pen
[طَعَامٌ]{.ar} |[TaeAmun]{.trn}   |masc.|a food
[مَاءٌ]{.ar}  |[mAEun]{.trn}     |masc.|a water
[مَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar}|[madrasatun]{.trn}|fem. |a school
[مَدِينَةٌ]{.ar}|[madInatun]{.trn} |fem. |a city
[غُرْفَةٌ]{.ar} |[gurfatun]{.trn}  |fem. |a room
[شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} |[cajaratun]{.trn} |fem. |a tree
[شَمْسٌ]{.ar}  |[camsun]{.trn}    |fem. |a sun
[قَمَرٌ]{.ar}  |[qamarun]{.trn}   |masc.|a moon
[عِلْمٌ]{.ar}  |[eilmun]{.trn}    |masc.|a knowledge
[قُوَّةٌ]{.ar}  |[quwwatun]{.trn}  |fem. |a strength
[حَيَاةٌ]{.ar} |[HayAtun]{.trn}   |fem. |a life
[مَوْتٌ]{.ar}  |[mawtun]{.trn}    |masc.|a death

In these nouns as well we note that feminine nouns usually end with a feminine marker like looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. There are a few feminine nouns that don't a feminine marker, like [شَمْسٌ]{.ar} [camsun]{.trn} (fem.) "a sun". These are not very many and if Allah wills we will not find it hard to memorize them.
