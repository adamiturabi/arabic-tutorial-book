# Gender

All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. Sometimes the nouns designate living beings, like "man", "woman", "human", "lion", "lioness", "tiger", "teacher".

In this case the gender of the nnoun matches the gender of the male or female living being they designate. 

Other times, the nouns designate inanimate objects,. In this case, the noun will still be grammatically masculine or feminine but this assignment will be arbitrary. Feminine nouns are often, but not always, formed by adding a feminine marker to the masculine noun. 

As we discussed earlier nouns are also used as description words, so some nouns are qualitative, like "someone happy", "someone or something big", etc.

To explain this further we'll classify nouns into:

1. _Rigid_ nouns
2. _Flexible_ nouns

## Rigid nouns

Rigid nouns include:

1. Nouns for living beings that are male and female.


You can see that sometimes the feminine noun is formed by simply adding the looped [tAE]{.trn} feminine marker [Ø©]{.ar} to the masculine noun, like man, woman. Other times, the feminine noun is completely different and unrelated to the masculine noun, like lion, lioness.

We also sometimes have one noun to refer to both male and female living beings, like animal, human, self. The word itself will still have one grammatical gender, although it can be used to refer to both sexes.

Animals often have different words for the male animal and the female animal, lie lion, lioness, bull, cow, billy goat, nanny goat. This is usually the case when the make and female animal appear very obviously different. For example, a male lion has a mane that distinguishes it from the female lioness. This is also the case when the male and female animal have different uses from an agricultural standpoint. For example, a cow provides milk for humans.

Otherwise, the same noun is often used to refer to both the male and female animal, like dog. (The word kalba does actually exist and can be used to refer to a female dog, but most often kalb will be used as the word for dog, no matter whether it is a male or female dog.)

2. Nouns for inanimate objects that are not physically male or female. However, since all nouns have to be either grammatically masculine or feminine, they will be assigned a gender.

## Some notes about rigid and flexible nouns

Rigid nouns are often primitive, or they are words for concepts.

Flexible nouns are usually based on some characteristic of the object.

Description words are usually from flexible nouns.


## In a later chapter:

Some flexible nouns become commonly used as words that designate specific things. 

Sometimes they may be inanimate objects like, e.g. naSIHah advice, muSIbah calamity.

Other times they are persons of only one gender, e.g., jAriyah girl. 

These now behave like rigid nouns in that we can not add or remove the feminine marker.

There are also other flexible nouns used as words that designate persons of both gender like mueallim, mueallimah.
