# Simple sentences

Arabic has two kinds of sentences:

1. [subject]{.syn}-[information]{.syn} sentences
2. Verbal sentences

## [subject-information]{.syn} sentences

Here is a simple sentence:

"The house is a building."

This kind of sentence is called a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. It consists of two parts:

1. The part before "is": "the house". This is who the sentence is about. We call this the [subject]{.syn} of the sentence.
2. The part after "is": "a building". This is telling us some information about the [subject]{.syn}. We call this the [information]{.syn}.

Arabic does not normally express the word "is". In order to express this sentence in Arabic we put the [subject]{.syn} first and then the [information]{.syn}. For these simple sentences the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} will be in the u-state.

"The house" is [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [albaytu]{.trn} and "a building" is [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn}. In order to say "The house is a building" we put the [subject]{.syn} first and put its [information]{.syn} after it. Both the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} are put in the u-state.

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu binAEun]{.trn}  
"The house is a building."

Now let's try saying "The man is a teacher."

"The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. For "a teacher" we have two words in Arabic: 

+ [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher" 
+ [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a female teacher" 

Obviously "the man" can only be [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher". So the sentence is:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

Let's try another example: "The animal is a cat."

"The animal" is [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}. For "a cat" we have two words:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

Usually, in Arabic [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat" is used for "a cat" if the animal's gender is not specified, or not important. So putting together the sentence we get:

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirratun]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat."

Note that, in this sentence, the [subject]{.syn} [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} "the animal" is a masculine noun. And the [information]{.syn} 
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat" is a feminine noun. So the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} do not match in gender. This is perfectly normal. We make the [information]{.syn} match the [subject]{.syn} in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the [information]{.syn}, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the [subject]{.syn}.

In this case there were separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the [information]{.syn}:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

but both of these can be applied to the [subject]{.syn}, because the [subject]{.syn} [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} (masc.) "the animal" is used for both male and female animals. [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} is chosen because it is commonly used for "a cat" as we have already explained.

We have already seen an example of matching the gender of the [information]{.syn} with the [subject]{.syn} in the example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

## A definite noun as the [information]{.syn}

In all three examples above, the [information]{.syn} was an indefinite noun: "a building", "a teacher", "a cat". We can also make the [information]{.syn} a definite noun:

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ ٱلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu -lbinAEu]{.trn}  
"The house is the building."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu]{.trn}  
"The man is the (male) teacher."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ ٱلْهِرَّةُ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu -lhirratu]{.trn}  
"The animal is the cat."

## An indefinite noun as the [subject]{.syn}

How about making the [subject]{.syn} an indefinite noun? Can we say:

+ A house is a building.
+ A man is the teacher.

It turns out that sentences where the [subject]{.syn} is an indefinite noun are not as simple to express in Arabic. We will learn some ways of expressing them later if Allah wills.

## Introduction to verbs

Here are some English sentences with verbs:

+ He wrote a book.
+ She wrote a book.
+ You wrote a book.
+ I wrote a book.

Each of these sentences has:

1. a pronoun ("he", "she", "you", "I") which is the doer of the verb,
2. the verb itself: "wrote", and
3. the doee of the verb, i.e., the object upon whom the action of the verb is done: "a book".

Notice in each sentence that the verb "wrote" remains the same irrespective of the doer of the verb.

In Arabic the doer pronoun is attached to the verb as a suffix. For example, the verb "wrote" in Arabic is [كَتَبْ]{.ar} [katab]{.trn}. And these are the doer pronoun suffixes:

1. [◌َ]{.ar}  [a]{.trn}  "he"
2. [ـَتْ]{.ar} [at]{.trn} "she"
3. [تَ]{.ar}  [ta]{.trn} "you (sing. masc.)"
4. [تِ]{.ar}  [ti]{.trn} "you (sing. fem.)"
5. [تُ]{.ar}  [tu]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.)"

Each of these can be attached to the basic verb stem [كَتَبْ]{.ar} [katab]{.trn} "wrote":

1. [◌َ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبَ]{.ar}   [kataba]{.trn} "He wrote."
2. [ـَتْ]{.ar} + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتََبَتْ]{.ar}  [katabat]{.trn} "She wrote."
3. [تَ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتَ]{.ar}  [katabta]{.trn} "You (sing. masc.) wrote."
4. [تِ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتِ]{.ar}  [katabti]{.trn} "You (sing. fem.) wrote."
5. [تُ]{.ar}  + [كَتَبْ]{.ar} = [كَتَبْتُ]{.ar}  [katabtu]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.) wrote."

The above are complete sentences in and of themselves. However, we can add the doee ("a book") too:

1.  [كَتَبَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [kataba kitAban.]{.trn} "He wrote a book."
2. [كَتََبَتْ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabat kitAban.]{.trn} "She wrote a book."
3. [كَتَبْتَ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabta kitAban.]{.trn} "You (sing. masc.) wrote a book."
4. [كَتَبْتِ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabti kitAban.]{.trn} "You (sing. fem.) wrote a book."
5. [كَتَبْتُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar} [katabtu kitAban.]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.) wrote a book."

Note that the doee [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} "a book" has an [an]{.trn}-mark and is therefore in the a-state. Direct doees of verbs shall be in the a-state.

The doee may be a definite noun instead of an indefinite noun, in which case it shall lose the [n]{.trn}-mark and be prefixed with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. However, it shall still be in the a-state. For example,

[كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
[kataba -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
"He wrote the book."

### Verbs with noun doers

So far we have seen verbs whose doers were pronouns ("he", "she", "you", "I"). Similar to English, instead of these pronouns, verbs may have nouns as doers. For example,

1. [كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَبًا.]{.ar}  
   [kataba -rrajulu kitAban.]{.trn}  
   "The man wrote a book."
2. [كَتَبَتْ جَارِيَةٌ ٱلْكِتَابَ]{.ar}  
   [katabat jAriyatuni -lkitAba.]{.trn}  
   "A girl wrote the book."

Note that:

+ Even when the doer is a noun, the pronoun suffixes for "he" or "she" are still attached to the verb depending on the gender of the doer. However, they are not translated.
+ The doer nouns are in the u-state. Doer nouns shall generally be in the u-state. 
+ The doer noun follows the verb. Sentence word order is somewhat flexible in Arabic but normally a verb's doer comes after the verb. English primarily uses word order to determine who the doer of a verb is and who the doee is. Conversely, Arabic uses the nouns' states to determine the doer and doee. As mentioned, the doer will be in the u-state and the doee will be in the a-state.


## Old intro to verbs

We have just learned about Arabic sentences that have a [subject]{.syn} and some [information]{.syn} about the sentence. There is a second kind of Arabic sentence that begins with a verb.

Here we will give a short introduction to Arabic verbs so that we can form more meaningful sentences. We will also deal with them in more detail in a later chapter, if Allah wills.

As an example, [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "[he] wrote" is an Arabic verb. Here is a sentence that uses this verb:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrajulu kitAban]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

Let's analyze this sentence. The verb comes in the beginning of the sentence. It is followed by the [doer]{.syn} of the verb "the man" in the u-state. Finally, we see the [object]{.syn} of the verb "a book" in the a-state.

This is the normal order of verbs in Arabic: the verb comes first, followed by the [doer]{.syn}, followed by the [object]{.syn}. The [doer]{.syn} will be in the u-state and the [object]{.syn} will be in the a-state.

Here are some more examples of Arabic verbs:

| Arabic verb   | Transcription   | Meaning          |
|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
|[فَتَحَ]{.ar}     |[fataHa]{.trn}   | [He] opened      |
|[أَكَلَ]{.ar}     |[Eakala]{.trn}   | [He] ate         |
|[شَرِبَ]{.ar}     |[cariba]{.trn}   | [He] drank       |
|[دَخَلَ]{.ar}     |[daxala]{.trn}   | [He] entered     |
|[قَرَأَ]{.ar}     |[qaraEa]{.trn}   | [He] read        |
|[أَخَذَ]{.ar}     |[Eaxapa]{.trn}   | [He] took        |

In sentences with verbs, the [doer]{.syn} and the [object]{.syn} can be either definite or indefinite. Here are some examples.

[فَتَحَ رَجُلٌ ٱلْبَابَ.]{.ar}  
[fataHa rajuluni -lbAba]{.trn}  
"A man opened the door."

[شَرِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱللَّبَنَ.]{.ar}  
[cariba l-gulAmu -llabana]{.trn}  
"The boy drank the milk."

[أَكَلَ أَسَدٌ بَقَرَةً.]{.ar}  
[Eakala Easadun baqaratan]{.trn}  
"A lion ate a cow."

In all the examples so far the [doer]{.syn} of the verb was maculine. If the [doer]{.syn} of the verb is feminine then we modify the verb by adding [تْ]{.ar} after it:

| Arabic verb   | Transcription   | Meaning          |
|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
|[فَتَحَتْ]{.ar}    |[fataHat]{.trn}  | [She] opened     |
|[أَكَلَتْ]{.ar}    |[Eakalat]{.trn}  | [She] ate        |
|[شَرِبَتْ]{.ar}    |[caribat]{.trn}  | [She] drank      |
|[دَخَلَتْ]{.ar}    |[daxalat]{.trn}  | [She] entered    |
|[قَرَأَتْ]{.ar}    |[qaraEat]{.trn}  | [She] read       |
|[أَخَذَتْ]{.ar}    |[Eaxapat]{.trn}  | [She] took       |

[دَخَلَتْ جَارِيَةٌ بَيْتًا.]{.ar}  
[daxalat jAriyatun baytan]{.trn}  
"A girl entered a house."

[شَرِبَتْ هِرَّةٌ ٱللَّبَنَ.]{.ar}  
[caribat hirratuni -llabana]{.trn}  
"A cat drank the milk."

If there is a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} after the verb then then null-vowel mark on the [tAE]{.trn} [تْ]{.ar} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark [تِ]{.ar}:

[أَكَلَتِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ ٱلطَّعَامَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakalati -mraEatuni -TTaeAma]{.trn}  
"A woman ate the food."

[قَرَأَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
[qaraEati -lmarEatu -lkitAba]{.trn}  
"The woman read the book."

Just like in English we can have sentences with verbs where the [object]{.syn} of the verb is not mentioned:

[شَرِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[cariba l-gulAmu]{.trn}  
"The boy drank."

[أَكَلَ أَسَدٌ.]{.ar}  
[Eakala Easadun]{.trn}  
"A lion ate."

[قَرَأَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ.]{.ar}  
[qaraEati -lmarEatu]{.trn}  
"The woman read."

## [subject-information]{.syn} verbs

As we've already mentioned Arabic does not normally express the word "is". However, it does express the verb "was".

| Arabic verb | Transcription | Meaning     |
|:------------|:--------------|:------------|
| [كَانَ]{.ar}  | [kAna]{.trn}  | [He] was    |
| [كَانَتْ]{.ar} | [kAnat]{.trn} | [She] was   |

[كَانَ]{.ar} [kAna]{.trn} behaves like any other verb in that its [doer]{.syn} is in the u-state and its [object]{.syn} is in the a-state. Examples:

[كَانَ ٱلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةً.]{.ar}  
[kAna -lbinAEu madrasatan]{.trn}  
"The building was a school."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ أُمًّا.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -lmarEatu Eumman]{.trn}  
"The woman was a mother."

However, this verb is special and a little different from other verbs. The [doer]{.syn} is not really doing any action. In fact, in meaning it is the [subject]{.syn} of a sentence and the [object]{.syn} of the verb is the [information]{.syn} about the [subject]{.syn}.

[كَانَ]{.ar} [kAna]{.trn} is an example of "[subject-information]{.syn} verbs".  Sentences that start with [subject-information]{.syn} verbs are both [subject]{.syn}-[information]{.syn} sentences and verbal sentences.

There are a few other verbs like [كَانَ]{.ar}, for example:

| Arabic verb | Transcription | Meaning     |
|:------------|:--------------|:------------|
| [صَارَ]{.ar}  | [SAra]{.trn}  | [He] became |
| [صَارَتْ]{.ar} | [SArat]{.trn} | [She] became|

## The word "and"

Arabic uses [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} to mean "and". It is written right next to the word after it without any space between it and the next word. 

[وَمَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar}  
[wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"and a school"

[وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} meaning "and" does not change the state of the noun following it. Examples:

[ٱَلْبِنَاءُ بَيْتٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEu baytun wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"The building is a house and a school."

[أَخَذَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا وَقَلَمًا.]{.ar}  
[Eaxapa -rrajulu kitAban waqalaman]{.trn}  
"The man took a book and pen."

[دَخَلَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْبَيْتَ.]{.ar}  
[daxalati -lmarEatu wa-ljAriyatu -lbayta]{.trn}  
"The woman and the girl entered the house."

We can also use [وَ]{.ar} to connect sentences:

[ٱلرَّجُلُ إِنْسَانٌ وَٱلْكَلْبُ حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu EinSAnun wa-lkalbu HayawAnun]{.trn}  
"The man is a human and the dog is an animal."
