# Simple sentences

## The subject and its information

Here is a simple sentence:

The house is a building.

This sentence consists of two parts

1. The part before "is": "the house". This is who the sentence is about. We call this the _subject_ of the sentence.
2. The part after "is": "a building". This is telling us some information about the subject. We call this the _information_.

Arabic has no word for "is". In order to express this sentence in Arabic we but the subject first and then the information. For these simple sentences the subject and the information will be in the u-state.

"The house" is [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [albaytu]{.trn} and "a building" is [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn}. In order to say "The house is a building" we put the subject first and put its information after it. Both the subject and the information are put in the u-state.

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu binAEun]{.trn}  
"The house is a building."

Now let's try saying "The man is a teacher."

"The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. For "a teacher" we have two words in Arabic: 

+ [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher" 
+ [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a female teacher" 

Obviously "the man" can only be [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher". So the sentence is:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

Let's try another example: "The animal is a cat."

"The animal" is [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}. For "a cat" we have two words:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

Usually, in Arabic [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat" is used for "a cat" if the animal's gender is not specified, or not important. So putting together the sentence we get:

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirratun]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat."

Note that, in this sentence, the subject [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} "the animal" is a masculine noun. And the information 
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat" is a feminine noun. So the subject and the information do not match in gender. This is perfectly normal. We make the information match the subject in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the subject.

In this case there were separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

but both of these can be applied to the subject, even though the subject [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} "the animal" is a masculine noun. [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} is chosen because it is commonly used for "a cat" as we have already explained.

We have already seen an example of matching the gender of the information with the subject in the example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

## Definite noun for the sentence's information

In all three examples above, the information was an indefinite noun: "a building", "a teacher", "a cat". We can also make the information a definite noun:

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ ٱلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu -lbinAEu]{.trn}  
"The house is the building."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu]{.trn}  
"The man is the (male) teacher."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ ٱلْهِرَّةُ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu -lhirratu]{.trn}  
"The animal is the cat."

## Indefinite noun for the sentence's subject

How about making the subject an indefinite noun? Can we say:

+ A house is a building.
+ A man is the teacher.

It turns out that sentences where the subject is an indefinite noun are not as simple to express in Arabic. We will learn some ways of expressing them later if Allah wills.

Note that both the subject 
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}, and the information about the subject 
[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn}
are in the u-state. For these simple sentences, both the subject and its information will always be in the u-state.

In these kinds of simple sentences, both the subject and its information must be nouns. In the previous chapter we learned that adjectives can behave as nouns when the appear without a described noun. For example, the adjective [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" can also be the descriptive noun "a big one".
We can use this noun as the information:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu kabIrun]{.trn}  
"The man is a big one."

This kind of sentence is also used in Arabic to mean "The man is big.". But remember that in the Arabic sentence the subject's information is technically the descriptive-noun meaning "a big one", not the adjective "big". We will just translate its meaning using the adjective "big".

In both sentences so far, the information was indefinite: [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a teacher", and [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big one". Can we make the information definite? For example,

"The man is the big one."

Let's try using the same technique. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "the big one" is [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn}. When we put the subject and its information together, we get:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}  
"The man is the big one."

But wait! Didn't we see in the last chapter that [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn} means "the big man" and that [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} is used as an adjective? That's true. So, it turns out that

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}

means both "The man is the big one." and "the big man". Usually we will need context to tell us which of the two is intended by the speaker. And soon, if Allah wills, we will also learn another technique to say "the man is the big one" to avoid confusion.

Similarly, if we put "the man" [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "the teacher" [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar} [almueallimu]{.trn} together, we get


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu]{.trn}

which can mean either

"The man is the teacher."  
or  
"The teacher man."

We have used the descriptive noun [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} "the big one" as the subject's information in a sentence. We can also use it as the subject in a sentence. Here are some examples:

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The big one is a man."

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The big one is a heavy one." = "The big one is heavy."

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ٱلثَّقِيلُ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The big one is the heavy one." or "The heavy big-one."

## Sentences with prepositional phrases

Here is another simple sentence:

"The man is in the house."

In this sentence the subject is "the man" and its information is the phrase "in the house". In order to express this in Arabic, we will do exactly what we've done so far: we'll put the subject and its information together in Arabic. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "in the house" is [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar} [fi -lbayti]{.trn}. Putting them together we get:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
The man is in the house.

Similarly,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi baytin]{.trn}  
The man is in a house.

## Sentences with indefinite subjects?

In all the sentences so far the subject [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} "the man" was definite. What if, instead, the subject was indefinite:

A man is a big one.
A man is in the house.

If we try to put the subject "a man" [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} and its information "a big one]" [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} together we get

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}  

And in the previous chapter we saw that this means "a big man" which is not a complete sentence. Unfortunately, this does not also mean "A man is a big [person]".

Similarly, if we try to say "a man is in the house", we get:

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  

And we saw in the last chapter that this means "a man in the house" which, again, is not a complete sentence. It does not also mean "A man is in the house."

It turns out that these kinds of sentences, where the subject is indefinite, are not straightforward in Arabic. If Allah wills, we will learn how to handle them later.

## Summary

We can summarize what we have learned so far in the table below:

Arabic   |Transcription|English
:--------|:------------|:--------------
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}    | [Earrajulu kabIrun]{.trn}   | "The man is big."
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  | [Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}  | "The man is the big one." or "the big man"
[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}    | [EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}   | "The big one is a man."
[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}   | [EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}   | "The big one is heavy."
[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ٱلثَّقِيلُ]{.ar} | [EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}   | "The big one is the heavy one." or "The heavy big-one."
[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}      | [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}     | "a big man"
[كَبِيرٌ ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}     | [kabIrun vaqIlun]{.trn}     | "a heavy big-one."
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}| [Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}| "The man is in the house."
[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  | [rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  | "a man in the house"

## Adding describers to the simple sentence.

In the previous chapter we have learned how to use adjectives to describe nouns. For example,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu]{.trn}  
"the happy man"

[مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
[mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}  
"a good teacher"

Can we use adjectives to describe the subject and its information in a simple sentence:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a teacher."

Yes, it's pretty straightforward. We simply put each adjective after its described noun and match it in definiteness and state.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}  
"The happy man is a good teacher."

/*
Note that [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -ssaeIdu]{.trn} in this sentence can only mean "the happy man" and it cannot mean "the man is the happy [person]". This is because we already have an unambiguous information for the subject, which is: 
[مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}
[mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}
"is a good teacher."

In other words we can't say

The man is a happy [person] is a good teacher.

because it doesn't make much sense.

Similarly, we can have a sentence where both the subject and its information are definite and both are being described with describer words.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ ٱلْحَسَنُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu -lmueallimu -lHasanu]{.trn}  
The happy man is the good teacher.

As we mentioned earlier we will learn a technique later, if Allah wills, where we can express this last sentence (where both the subject and its information are definite) in a different and more clear manner.
*/

Now let's try using descriptions in a sentence with a prepositional phrase.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn}  
The happy man is in the big house.

/*
## Nouns that are usually description words can be sentence subjects as well

Remember in the previous chapter, we mentioned that description words are nouns themselves. They just happen to be used most often as description words. But they can be used as regular nouns as well. For example [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big [person or thing]" is commonly used as a description word. But we may also use it as the subject of a sentence:

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru saeIdun]{.trn}  
"The big [person] is happy."

In this case we know that [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} is "the big person" and not "the big thing" because the description word [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} "a happy [person]" is only applicable to persons.
*/
