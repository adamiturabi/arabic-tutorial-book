# Simple sentences

## The subject and its information

Here is a simple sentence:

The man is a teacher.

This sentence consists of two parts

1. The subject of the sentence: "the man"
2. Some information about the subject: "is a teacher"

Let's see how we can say this sentence in Arabic. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "a teacher" is [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn}. But Arabic has no word for "is". In order to say "the man is big" we put the subject first and put its information next to it and we get:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}

Note that both the subject 
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}, and the information about the subject 
[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn}
are in the u-state. For these simple sentences, both the subject and its information will always be in the u-state.

Let's take a look at another example:

The man is big.

The subject is "the man" and the information about the subject is "is big". Remeber that Arabic does not technically have an adjective that means "big". It has a noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} which means "someone or something big". So, just like the previous sentence, we put the subject and its information together and get


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu kabIrun]{.trn}

Technically this sentence means "The man is someone or something big" but it is better translated as

The man is a big [person].

In both these sentences, the information was indefinite: [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a teacher", and [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big [person]". Can we make the information definite? For example,

The man is the big [person].

Let's try using the same technique. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "the big [person]" is [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn}. When we put the subject and its information together, we get:


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}
The man is the big [person].

But wait! Didn't we see in the last chapter that [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn} means "the big man" and that [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} is used as a describer? That's true. So, it turns out that

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}

means both "the man is the big [person]" and "the big man". Usually we will need context to tell us which of the two is intended by the speaker. And soon, if Allah wills, we will also learn another technique to say "the man is the big [person]" to avoid confusion.

Similarly, if we put "the man" [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "the teacher" [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar} [almueallimu]{.trn} together, we get


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu]{.trn}

which can mean either

+ The man is the teacher, or
+ The teacher man.

## Sentences with prepositional phrases

We can have sentences where the information about the subject is a prepositional phrase. For example

The man is in the house.

The subject is "the man" and its information is "in the house". We will do exactly what we've done so far: we'll put the subject and its information together in Arabic. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "in the house" is [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar} [fi -lbayti]{.trn}. Putting them together we get:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
The man is in the house.

Similarly,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu fi baytin]{.trn}  
The man is in a house.

## Sentences with indefinite subjects?

In all the sentences so far the subject [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} "the man" was definite. What if, instead, the subject was indefinite:

A man is a big [person].  
A man is in the house.

If we try to put the subject "a man" [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} and its information "a big [person]" []{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} together we get

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}  

And in the previous chapter we saw that this means "a big man" which is not a complete sentence. Unfortunately, this does not also mean "A man is a big [person]".

Similarly, if we try to say "a man is in the house", we get:

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  

And we saw in the last chapter that this means "a man in the house" which , again, is not a complete sentence. It does not also mean "A man is in the house."

It turns out that these kinds of sentences, where the subject is indefinite, are not straightforward in Arabic. If Allah wills, we will learn how to handle them later.

## Summary

We can summarize what we have learned so far in the table below:

Arabic   |Transcription|English
:--------|:------------|:--------------
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}| [Earrajulu kabIrun]{.trn}| "The man is a big [person]."
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}| [Earrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}| "The man is the big [person]." or "the big man"
[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}| [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}| "a big man"
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}| [Earrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}| "The man is in the house."
[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}| [rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}| "a man in the house"

## Adding describers to the simple sentence.

We've already learned how to express a simple sentence:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
The man is a teacher

And we also know how to describe nouns:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu]{.trn}  
the happy man

[رَجُلٌ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[rajulun saeIdun]{.trn}  
a happy man

Can we try to combine these to describe nouns in a simple sentence? Yes, it's pretty straightforward. We simply put the describer word after the described noun and match it in definiteness and state.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}  
The happy man is a good teacher.

Note that [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -ssaeIdu]{.trn} in this sentence can only mean "the happy man" and it cannot mean "the man is the happy [person]". This is because we already have an unambiguous information for the subject, which is: "is a good teacher."

In other words we can't say

The man is a happy [person] is a good teacher.

because it doesn't make much sense.

Similarly, we can have a sentence where both the subject and its information are definite and both are being described with describer words.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ ٱلْحَسَنُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu -lmueallimu -lHasanu]{.trn}  
The happy man is the good teacher.

As we mentioned earlier we will learn a technique later, if Allah wills, where we can express this last sentence (where both the subject and its information are definite) in a different and more clear manner.

Now let's try using descriptions in a sentence with a prepositional phrase.

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar}  
['arrajulu -ssaeIdu fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn}  
The happy man is in the big house.
