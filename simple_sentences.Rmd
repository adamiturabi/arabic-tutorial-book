# Simple sentences

Here is a simple sentence:

The man is a teacher.

This sentence consists of two parts

1. The subject of the sentence: "the man"
2. Some information about the subject: "is a teacher"

Let's see how we can say this sentence in Arabic. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "a teacher" is [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn}. But Arabic has no word for "is". In order to say "the man is big" we put the subject first and put its information next to it and we get:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}

Note that both the subject 
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}, and the information about the subject 
[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn}
are in the u-state. For these simple sentences, both the subject and its information will always be in the u-state.

Let's take a look at another example:

The man is big.

The subject is "the man" and the information about the subject is "is big". Remeber that Arabic does not have an adjective that means "big". It has a noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} which means "someone or something big". So, just like the previous sentence, we put the subject and its information together and get


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu kabIrun]{.trn}

Technically this sentence means "The man is someone or something big" but it is better translated as

The man is a big [person].

In both these sentences, the information was indefinite: [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a teacher", and [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big [person]". Can we make the information definite? For example,

The man is the big [person].

Let's try using the same technique. "The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn} and "the big [person]" is [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn}. When we put the subject and its information together, we get:


[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}

This is correct. So we can see that we generally put the subject and its information together to make a simple sentence.

But wait! Didn't we see in the last chapter that 
[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}
means "the big man" and that [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} is used as a describer? That's true. So, it turns out that

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
[arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}

means both "the man is the big [person]" and "the big man". Usually we will need context to tell us which of the two is intended by the speaker. And soon, if Allah wills, we will also learn another technique to say "the man is the big [person]" to avoid confusion.
