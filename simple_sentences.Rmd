# Simple sentences

Arabic has two kinds of sentences:

1. Subject-information sentences
2. Verbal sentences

## The subject and its information

Here is a simple sentence:

"The house is a building."

This sentence consists of two parts

1. The part before "is": "the house". This is who the sentence is about. We call this the _subject_ of the sentence.
2. The part after "is": "a building". This is telling us some information about the subject. We call this the _information_.

Arabic has no word for "is". In order to express this sentence in Arabic we put the subject first and then the information. For these simple sentences the subject and the information will be in the u-state.

"The house" is [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [albaytu]{.trn} and "a building" is [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn}. In order to say "The house is a building" we put the subject first and put its information after it. Both the subject and the information are put in the u-state.

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu binAEun]{.trn}  
"The house is a building."

Now let's try saying "The man is a teacher."

"The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. For "a teacher" we have two words in Arabic: 

+ [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher" 
+ [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a female teacher" 

Obviously "the man" can only be [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher". So the sentence is:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

Let's try another example: "The animal is a cat."

"The animal" is [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}. For "a cat" we have two words:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

Usually, in Arabic [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat" is used for "a cat" if the animal's gender is not specified, or not important. So putting together the sentence we get:

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirratun]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat."

Note that, in this sentence, the subject [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} "the animal" is a masculine noun. And the information 
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat" is a feminine noun. So the subject and the information do not match in gender. This is perfectly normal. We make the information match the subject in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the subject.

In this case there were separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

but both of these can be applied to the subject, because the subject [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} (masc.) "the animal" is used for both male and female animals. [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} is chosen because it is commonly used for "a cat" as we have already explained.

We have already seen an example of matching the gender of the information with the subject in the example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

## Definite noun for the sentence's information

In all three examples above, the information was an indefinite noun: "a building", "a teacher", "a cat". We can also make the information a definite noun:

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ ٱلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu -lbinAEu]{.trn}  
"The house is the building."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu]{.trn}  
"The man is the (male) teacher."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ ٱلْهِرَّةُ]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu -lhirratu]{.trn}  
"The animal is the cat."

## Indefinite noun for the sentence's subject

How about making the subject an indefinite noun? Can we say:

+ A house is a building.
+ A man is the teacher.

It turns out that sentences where the subject is an indefinite noun are not as simple to express in Arabic. We will learn some ways of expressing them later if Allah wills.

## Introduction to verbs

We have just learned about Arabic sentences that have a subject and some information about the sentence. There is a second kind of Arabic sentence that begins with a verb.

Here we will give a short introduction to Arabic verbs so that we can form more meaningful sentences. We will also deal with them in more detail in a later chapter, if Allah wills.

As an example, [كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn} "[he] wrote" is an Arabic verb. Here is a sentence that uses this verb:

[كَتَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا.]{.ar}  
[kataba -rrajulu kitAban]{.trn}  
"The man wrote a book."

Let's analyze this sentence. The verb comes in the beginning of the sentence. It is followed by the doer of the verb "the man" in the u-state. Finally, we see the object of the verb "a book" in the a-state.

This is the normal order of verbs in Arabic: the verb comes first, followed by the doer, followed by the object. The doer will be in the u-state and the object will be in the a-state.

Here are some more examples of Arabic verbs:

| Arabic verb   | Transcription   | Meaning          |
|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
|[فَتَحَ]{.ar}     |[fataHa]{.trn}   | [He] opened      |
|[أَكَلَ]{.ar}     |[Eakala]{.trn}   | [He] ate         |
|[شَرِبَ]{.ar}     |[cariba]{.trn}   | [He] drank       |
|[دَخَلَ]{.ar}     |[daxala]{.trn}   | [He] entered     |
|[قَرَأَ]{.ar}     |[qaraEa]{.trn}   | [He] read        |
|[أَخَذَ]{.ar}     |[Eaxapa]{.trn}   | [He] took        |

In sentences with verbs, the doer and the object can be either definite or indefinite. Here are some examples.

[فَتَحَ رَجُلٌ ٱلْبَابَ.]{.ar}  
[fataHa rajuluni -lbAba]{.trn}  
"A man opened the door."

[شَرِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ ٱللَّبَنَ.]{.ar}  
[cariba l-gulAmu -llabana]{.trn}  
"The boy drank the milk."

[أَكَلَ أَسَدٌ بَقَرَةً.]{.ar}  
[Eakala Easadun baqaratan]{.trn}  
"A lion ate a cow."

In all the examples so far the doer of the verb was maculine. If the doer of the verb is masculine then we modify the verb by adding [تْ]{.ar} after it:

| Arabic verb   | Transcription   | Meaning          |
|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
|[فَتَحَتْ]{.ar}    |[fataHat]{.trn}  | [She] opened     |
|[أَكَلَتْ]{.ar}    |[Eakalat]{.trn}  | [She] ate        |
|[شَرِبَتْ]{.ar}    |[caribat]{.trn}  | [She] drank      |
|[دَخَلَتْ]{.ar}    |[daxalat]{.trn}  | [She] entered    |
|[قَرَأَتْ]{.ar}    |[qaraEat]{.trn}  | [She] read       |
|[أَخَذَتْ]{.ar}    |[Eaxapat]{.trn}  | [She] took       |

[دَخَلَتْ جَارِيَةٌ بَيْتًا.]{.ar}  
[daxalat jAriyataun baytan]{.trn}  
"A girl entered a house."

[شَرِبَتْ هِرَّةٌ ٱللَّبَنَ.]{.ar}  
[caribat hirratuni -llabana]{.trn}  
"A cat drank the milk."

If there is a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} after the verb then then null-vowel mark on the [tAE]{.trn} [تْ]{.ar} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark [تِ]{.ar}:

[أَكَلَتِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ ٱلطَّعَامَ.]{.ar}  
[Eakalati -mraEatuni -TTaeAma]{.trn}  
"A woman ate the food."

[قَرَأَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْكِتَابَ.]{.ar}  
[qaraEati -lmarEatu -lkitAba]{.trn}  
"The woman read the book."

Just like in English we can have sentences with verbs where the object of the verb is not mentioned:

[شَرِبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[cariba l-gulAmu]{.trn}  
"The boy drank."

[أَكَلَ أَسَدٌ.]{.ar}  
[Eakala Easadun]{.trn}  
"A lion ate."

[قَرَأَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ.]{.ar}  
[qaraEati -lmarEatu]{.trn}  
"The woman read."

## The verb "was"

As we've already mentioned Arabic has no verb for "is". However, it does have the verb "was".

| Arabic verb | Transcription | Meaning     |
|:------------|:--------------|:------------|
| [كَانَ]{.ar}  | [kAna]{.trn}  | [He] was    |
| [كَانَتْ]{.ar} | [kAnat]{.trn} | [She] was   |

It behaves like any other verb in that its doer is in the u-state and it's object is in the a-state.

[كَانَ ٱلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةً.]{.ar}  
[kAna -lbinAEu madrasatan]{.trn}  
"The building was a school."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ أُمًّا.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -lmarEatu Eumman]{.trn}
"The woman was a mother."

This verb is special and a little different from other verbs. In meaning its doer is the subject of a sentence and its object is the infomation about the subject. Unlike other verbs, the verb itself doesn't actually describe any action done by the doer.

There are a few other verbs like [كَانَ]{.ar}, for example:

| Arabic verb | Transcription | Meaning     |
|:------------|:--------------|:------------|
| [صَارَ]{.ar}  | [Sara]{.trn}  | [He] became |
| [صَارَتْ]{.ar} | [Sarat]{.trn} | [She] became|

Sentences that start with "verbs like [كَانَ]{.ar}" are both subject-information sentences and verbal sentences.

## The word "and"

Arabic uses [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} to mean "and". It is written right next to the word after it without any space between it and the next word. 

[وَمَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar}  
[wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"and a school"

[وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} meaning "and" does not change the state of the noun following it. Examples:

[ٱَلْبِنَاءُ بَيْتٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEu baytun wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"The building is a house and a school."

[أَخَذَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا وَقَلَمًا.]{.ar}  
[Eaxapa -rrajulu kitAban waqalaman]{.trn}  
"The man took a book and pen."

[دَخَلَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْبَيْتَ.]{.ar}  
[daxalati -lmarEatu wa-ljAriyatu -lbayta]{.trn}  
"The woman and the girl entered the house."

We can also use [وَ]{.ar} to connect sentences:

[ٱلرَّجُلُ إِنْسَانٌ وَٱلْكَلْبُ حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu EinSAnun wa-lkalbu HayawAnun]{.trn}  
"The man is a human and the dog is an animal."
