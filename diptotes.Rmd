# Non-fully-changing nouns and proper nouns

## Introduction to word roots

Native Arabic words are generally derived from roots. Most roots are comprised of three letters. A smaller number are comprised of four or more letters. Words derived from the same root often share some basic meaning (although this is not always obvious). Words are derived from their roots according to patterns. In traditional Arabic grammar studies, the root [فعل]{.arroot} is used as a template for three-letter roots to showcase word and meaning patterns. The template root [فعلل]{.arroot} is used for four-letter roots.

Here is an example of some words and their patterns that are derived from the root  [كتب]{.arroot}:

Word  | Pattern | Meaning 
:----------|:-----------|:-----------
[كَتَبَ]{.ar} [kataba]{.trn}        | [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} | he wrote
[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}      | [فِعَالٌ]{.ar} [fieAlun]{.trn} | a book
[كَاتِبٌ]{.ar} [kAtibun]{.trn}      | [فَاعِلٌ]{.ar} [fAeilun]{.trn} | a writer
[مَكْتُوبٌ]{.ar} [maktUbun]{.trn}    | [مَفْعُولٌ]{.ar} [mafeUlun]{.trn} | written
[مَكْتَبَةٌ]{.ar} [maktabatun]{.trn}  | [مَفْعَلَةٌ]{.ar} [mafealatun]{.trn} | a library
[ٱِكْتِتَابٌ]{.ar} [EiktitAbun]{.trn} | [ٱِفْتِعَالٌ]{.ar} [EiftieAlun]{.trn} | a registration
[مُكَاتَبَةٌ]{.ar} [mukAtabatun]{.trn}| [مُفَاعَلَةٌ]{.ar} [mufAealatun]{.trn} | a written exchange, a correspondence

In the above table you can see that all the words derived from the root [كتب]{.arroot} share a meaning that is related to writing. Also, the different words are formed by adding additional letters and vowels to the three-letter root.

Root letters are generally preserved in all words derived from a root. You can see this in the table above where the letters [ك، ت، ب]{.ar} are found in all the words derived from this root. There are some exceptions to this rule. The most notable is when one or more of the root letters is from the set {[ا، ء، و، ي]{.ar}}. The letters in this set are known as weak letters. Words that are derived from roots that have weak letters often exchange one weak letter for another, or sometimes drop the letter all together. For example, here are some words derived from the root [دعو]{.arroot}:

Word  | Note
:----------|:-----------
[دَعَا]{.ar} [daeA]{.trn}    | [و]{.ar} exchanged for [ا]{.ar}
[يَدْعُو]{.ar} [yadeU]{.trn}   | [و]{.ar} retained
[ٱُدْعُ]{.ar} [Eudeu]{.trn}   | [و]{.ar} dropped altogether
[دُعَاءٌ]{.ar} [dueAEun]{.trn}   | [و]{.ar} exchanged for [ء]{.ar}
[ٱِدَّعَىٰ]{.ar} [EiddaeA]{.trn} | [و]{.ar} exchanged for [ىٰ]{.ar}

## Non-fully-changing nouns

Here is an example of the kind of nouns we have learned so far:

State  | Indefinite | Definite
:------|:-----------|:---------
u-state| [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} | [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}
a-state| [رَجُلًا]{.ar}| [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar}
i-state| [رَجُلٍ]{.ar} | [ٱَلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}

As you can see, the noun has [n]{.trn}-marks when it is indefinite, and also, the vowel mark on the last letter changes for each state that the noun is in. These kinds of nouns are called _fully-changing_ nouns. They are by far the most common type of noun.

There are a few nouns, however, that are _non-fully-changing_. Here is an example of a non-fully-changing noun, [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAEu]{.trn} "a desert":

State  | Indefinite | Definite
:------|:-----------|:---------
u-state| [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} | [ٱَلصَّحْرَاءُ]{.ar}
a-state| [صَحْرَاءَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلصَّحْرَاءَ]{.ar}
i-state| [صَحْرَاءِ]{.ar} | [ٱَلصَّحْرَاءِ]{.ar}

When definite, non-fully-changing nouns look just like full-changing nouns. But when indefinite, they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks, and furthermore, their final letter has an [a]{.trn}-mark, not an [i]{.trn}-mark when the noun. (There is one circumstance where an indefinite non-fully-changing noun's final letter has an [i]{.trn}-mark in the i-state. We'll learn this in a later chapter, if Allah wills.)

The root of the word [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAEu]{.trn} "a desert" is [صحر]{.arroot}. And its pattern (according to the template root [فعل]{.arroot}) is [فَعْلَاءُ]{.ar} [faelAEu]{.trn}. The ending [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} is not part of the root and is actually a feminine marker. In addition to looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, Arabic has two other feminine markers for singular nouns:

+ [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn}
+ [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn}

Nouns with the feminine markers [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} and [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} are always non-fully-changing nouns. [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn} "a remembrance" is an example of a feminine noun with the [ىٰ]{.ar} feminine marker. The root of [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn} is [ذكر]{.arroot} and its pattern is [فِعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [fielA]{.trn}.

Since [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn} already ends with a vowel, the last letter won't have any additional vowel markers and therefore the word will appear the same in all states:

  State  | Indefinite | Definite
  :------|:-----------|:---------
  u-state| [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ]{.ar}
  a-state| [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ]{.ar}
  i-state| [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلذِّكْرَىٰ]{.ar}

Examples of sentences with non-fully changing nouns:

[ٱَلْكِتَابُ ذِكْرَىٰ جَمِيلةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalkitAbu pikrA jamIlatun]{.trn}  
"The book is a beautiful remembrance."

[ذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ إِلَىٰ صَحْرَاءَ وَاسِعَةٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba -rrajulu EilA SaHrAEa wAsieatin]{.trn}  
"The man went to a wide desert."

Note how the describers in both examples are feminine because the described nouns are feminine. Also note how, in the last example, [صَحْرَاءَ]{.ar} [SaHrAEa]{.trn} has an [a]{.trn}-mark despite being in the i-state (due to being after a preposition). Yet the adjective [وَاسِعَةٍ]{.ar} [wAsieatin]{.trn} has an [in]{.trn}-mark because it matches the state of the described noun, not the vowel mark on its final letter.

### Identifying  feminine markers

Unlike [ة]{.ar}, which is almost always a feminine marker for singular words, [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are not always feminine markers. They are only feminine markers when they are suffixes that are external to the word's root. This was the case for [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAEu]{.trn} and [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn}.

But there are some words where [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} and [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} are not external to the word's root. For example,

Word | Root | Note
:--------------|:---------------|:------------------
[دُعَاءٌ]{.ar} [dueAEun]{.trn}  | [دعو]{.arroot} | [و]{.ar} substituted with [ء]{.ar} 
[ٱَلْهُدَىٰ]{.ar} [EalhudA]{.trn} | [هدي]{.arroot} | [ي]{.ar} substituted with [ىٰ]{.ar} 

In such cases [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} and [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} will not be feminine markers and the words will be fully-changing, not non-fully-changing. As we progress in learning Arabic, it will become easier, if Allah wills, to identify when these endings are feminine markers external to the word's root and when they are not.

So far, we have seen examples of non-fully-changing nouns that are common nouns: [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAEu]{.trn} "a desert" and [ذِكْرَىٰ]{.ar} [pikrA]{.trn} "a remembrance". In addition, there are also non-fully-changing nouns that are descriptive nouns. These will have masculine and feminine nouns. The feminine nouns will have one of the two feminine markers: [اء]{.ar} and [ىٰ]{.ar}. As we'll see, the masculine desriptive noun is usually somewhat modified before adding the feminine marker.
 
Root | Masc. Noun | Fem. noun | Meaning
:----|:-----------|:-------------|:------------
[غضب]{.arroot} | [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} | [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar}   | very angry
[عطش]{.arroot} | [عَطْشَانُ]{.ar} | [عَطْشَىٰ]{.ar}   | very thirsty
[جوع]{.arroot} | [جَوْعَانُ]{.ar} | [جَوْعَىٰ]{.ar}   | very hungry
[حمر]{.arroot} | [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar}  | [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | red
[زرق]{.arroot} | [أَزْرَقُ]{.ar}  | [زَرْقَاءُ]{.ar}  | blue
[صفر]{.arroot} | [أَصْفَرُ]{.ar}  | [صَفْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | yellow
[خضر]{.arroot} | [أَخْضَرُ]{.ar}  | [خَضْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | green
[سود]{.arroot} | [أَسْوَدُ]{.ar}  | [سَوْدَاءُ]{.ar}  | black
[بيض]{.arroot} | [أَبْيَضُ]{.ar}  | [بَيْضَاءُ]{.ar}  | white
[عرج]{.arroot} | [أَعْرَجُ]{.ar}  | [عَرْجَاءُ]{.ar}  | lame
[حور]{.arroot} | [أَحْوَرُ]{.ar}  | [حَوْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | beautiful eyed
[بكم]{.arroot} | [أَبْكَمُ]{.ar}  | [بَكْمَاءُ]{.ar}  | mute

Above are some examples of non-fully-changing descriptive nouns. We have given only indefinite nouns in the u-state and you may form the definite noun as we showed for [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAEu]{.trn} 

You should be able to see that the non-fully-changing in the table above fall into common patterns in both structure and meaning. Colors and physical characteristics are of the pattern [أَفْعَلُ]{.ar} [Eafealu]{.trn} (masc.) and [فَعْلَاءُ]{.ar} [faelAEu]{.trn} (fem.); and intensive emotional and physical states are of the pattern [فَعْلَانُ]{.ar} [faelAnu]{.trn} (masc.) [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [faelA]{.trn} (fem.). Such structure and meaning patterns are quite common in Arabic vocabulary.

### Examples

## Proper nouns

In this section we will give a brief introduction to proper nouns. We will give only some basic rules and not deal with any exceptions.

Proper nouns in Arabic are always definite. Even though they are definite, most proper nouns do not start with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}.

### Male names

Here are some examples of male names: 

+ [مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar} [muHammadun]{.trn} "[#muHammad]{.trn2}"
+ [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} "[#zayd]{.trn2}"
+ [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} "[#saeId]{.trn2}"

Note that the names have an [n]{.trn}-mark even though they are definite. Names are also often originally descriptive nouns with a good meaning. For example, [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} "[#saeId]{.trn2}" is a descriptive noun meaning "happy".

Sometimes, it is not clear from the sentence itself whether a word is used as a descriptive noun, or as a name. For example:

[جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa saeIdun]{.trn}  
"A happy (masc.) one came."  
OR  
"[#saeId]{.trn2} came."

### Female names

Female names often, but not always, end with a feminine marker. They too are definite without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} but they differ from male names in that they are almost always non-fully-changing nouns. Therefore they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks. 

Here are some examples of female names: 

+ [جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar} [jamIlatu]{.trn} "[#jamIlah]{.trn2}"
+ [فَاطِمَةُ]{.ar} [faTimatu]{.trn} "[#fATimah]{.trn2}"
+ [زَيْنَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} "[#zaynab]{.trn2}"

Even when the name is originally a descriptive noun which is fully-changing, it will become non-fully-changing when used as a name. For example:

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatun]{.trn}  
"A beautiful (fem.) one came."

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatu]{.trn}  
"[#jamIlah]{.trn2} came."

### Place names

Place names are usually, but not always, feminine. Some place names have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

+ [مَكَّةُ]{.ar} [makkatu]{.trn} (fem.) "Mecca"
+ [مِصْرُ]{.ar} [miSru]{.trn} (fem.) "Egypt"
+ [ٱَلْعِرَاقُ]{.ar} [EaleirAqu]{.trn} (masc.) "Iraq"

### Describing proper nouns

Just like common-nouns, proper nouns can be described using descriptive nouns. The descriptive noun will follow the proper noun and match it in state and definiteness. Since the proper noun is definite (without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}), the descriptive noun will also be definite (with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}).

[جَاءَ مُحَمَّدٌ ٱلْكَرِيمُ.]{.ar}  
[jAEa muHammaduni -lkarImu.]{.trn}  
"[#muHammad]{.trn2} the generous came."
