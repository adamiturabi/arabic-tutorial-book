# Partially-changing and proper nouns

## Partially-changing nouns

Here is an example of the kind of nouns we have learned so far:

State  | Indefinite | Definite
:------|:-----------|:---------
u-state| [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} | [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}
a-state| [رَجُلًا]{.ar}| [ٱَلرَّجُلَ]{.ar}
i-state| [رَجُلٍ]{.ar} | [ٱَلرَّجُلِ]{.ar}

As you can see, the noun has [n]{.trn}-marks when it is indefinite, and also, the vowel mark on the last letter changes for each state that the noun is in. These kinds of nouns are called _fully-changing_ nouns. They are by far the most common type of noun.

There are a few nouns, however, that are _partially-changing_. Here is an example of a partially-changing descriptive noun, [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} "very angry":

State  | Indefinite | Definite
:------|:-----------|:---------
u-state| [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَانُ]{.ar}
a-state| [غَضْبَانَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَانَ]{.ar}
i-state| [غَضْبَانَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَانِ]{.ar}

When definite, partially-changing nouns look just like full-changing nouns. But when indefinite, they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks, and furthermore, their final letter has an [a]{.trn}-mark, not an [i]{.trn}-mark when the noun occurs by itself in the i-state. (They do take the [i]{.trn}-mark when the noun is _attached_ to another noun. We will learn about this later, if Allah wills.)

Partially-changing descriptive nouns usually form their feminine using a different feminine marker than looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. They will either use 

+ [ىٰ]{.ar} [aa]{.trn}, or
+ [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn}.

In both cases, the masculine noun is modified before adding the feminine marker. 
Here are some more examples of partially changing nouns. We will only give the indefinite nouns in the u-state and you may form the definite noun as shown in the examples above.

Masc. Noun | Fem. noun | Meaning
:-----------|:-------------|:------------
[غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} | [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar}   | very angry
[عَطْشَانُ]{.ar} | [عَطْشَىٰ]{.ar}   | very thirsty
[جَوْعَانُ]{.ar} | [جَوْعَىٰ]{.ar}   | very hungry
[أَحْمَرُ]{.ar}  | [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | red
[أَزْرَقُ]{.ar}  | [زَرْقَاءُ]{.ar}  | blue
[أَصْفَرُ]{.ar}  | [صَفْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | yellow
[أَخْضَرُ]{.ar}  | [خَضْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | green
[أَسْوَدُ]{.ar}  | [سَوْدَاءُ]{.ar}  | black
[أَبْيَضُ]{.ar}  | [بَيْضَاءُ]{.ar}  | white
[أَعْرَجُ]{.ar}  | [عَرْجَاءُ]{.ar}  | lame
[أَحْوَرُ]{.ar}  | [حَوْرَاءُ]{.ar}  | beautiful eyed
[أَبْكَمُ]{.ar}  | [بَكْمَاءُ]{.ar}  | mute

Did you notice some form and meaning patterns in the above examples? In general, Arabic words fall into patterns. Words of a pattern behave in a similar way. Patterns are based on a three-letter root which is arranged in a specific way to form the pattern. In Arabic studies, the root [ف-ع-ل]{.ar} is used to show the arrangement of word patterns.

In the above table, all the nouns are descriptive nouns. One category of nouns is of the pattern [فَعْلَانُ]{.ar} [faelAnu]{.trn} for the masculine noun and [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [faelA]{.trn} for the feminine noun. These all have an intensive meaning pattern: "very angry", "very thirsty", "very hungry", etc.

The other category is of the pattern [أَفْعَلُ]{.ar} [Eafealu]{.trn} for the masculine noun and [فَعْلَاءُ]{.ar} [faelAEu]{.trn} for the feminine noun. The meanings are either colors or physical characteristics and disabilities. 

Here are some important notes regarding partially changing nouns:

+ Since [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} [faelA]{.trn} ends with a vowel, the last letter won't have any more vowel markers and therefore the word will appear the same in all states:

  State  | Indefinite | Definite
  :------|:-----------|:---------
  u-state| [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْفَعْلَىٰ]{.ar}
  a-state| [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْفَعْلَىٰ]{.ar}
  i-state| [فَعْلَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْفَعْلَىٰ]{.ar}

+ [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are only feminine markers if they are added on to the three-letter root of the word. There are some roots where [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are part of the three-letter root. In this case the endings [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are not feminine markers and the word is usually masculine. Examples: [ٱَلْهُدَىٰ]{.ar} [alhudA]{.trn} "the guidance" and [دُعَاءٌ]{.ar} [dueAEun]{.trn} "a supplication" are both masculine words. If Allah wills, you will be able to tell when these endings are feminine markers with practice.

+ There are more patterns for partially-changing nouns that we will learn later, if Allah wills.

## Proper nouns

In this section we will give a brief introduction to proper nouns. We will give only some basic rules and not deal with any exceptions.

Proper nouns in Arabic are always definite. Even though they are definite, most proper nouns do not start with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}.

### Masculine names

Here are some examples of male names: 

+ [مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar} [muhammadun]{.trn} "Muhammad"
+ [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} "Zayd"
+ [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} "Saeed"

Note that the names have an [n]{.trn}-mark even though they are definite. Names are also often originally descriptive nouns with a good meaning. For example, [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} "Saeed" is a descriptive noun meaning "happy".

Sometimes, it is not clear from the sentence itself whether a word is used as a descriptive noun, or as a name. For example:

[جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa saeIdun]{.trn}  
"A happy (masc.) one came."  
OR  
"Saeed came."

### Femimine names

Female names often, but not always, end with a feminine marker. They too are definite without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} but they differ from male names in that they are partially-changing nouns. Therefore they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks. 

Here are some examples of feminine names: 

+ [جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar} [jamIlatu]{.trn} "Jameela"
+ [فَاطِمَةُ]{.ar} [faTimatu]{.trn} "Fatima"
+ [زَيْنَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} "Zaynab"

Even when the name is originally a descriptive noun which is fully-changing, it will become partially-changing when used as a name. For example:

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatun]{.trn}  
"A beautiful (fem.) one came."

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatu]{.trn}  
"Jameela came."

### Place names

Place names are usually, but not always, feminine. Some place names have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

+ [مَكَّةُ]{.ar} [makkatu]{.trn} (fem.) "Mecca"
+ [مِصْرُ]{.ar} [miSru]{.trn} (fem.) "Egypt"
+ [ٱَلْعِرَاقُ]{.ar} [EaleirAqu]{.trn} (masc.) "Iraq"

### Describing proper nouns

Just like common-nouns, proper nouns can be described using descriptive nouns. The descriptive noun will follow the proper noun and match it in state and definiteness. Since the proper noun is definite (without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}), the descriptive noun will also be definite (with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}).

[غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} is a masculine descriptive noun meaning "very angry". The feminine of this descriptive noun is formed, not by adding the looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} feminine marker, but by removing the last part of the word [ان]{.ar} and adding another feminine marker: [ىٰ]{.ar} [yAE]{.trn} that is pronounced as long-[A]{.trn} vowel. So the feminine of [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} is [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}. Note that since [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn} ends with a vowel, the last letters won't have any more vowel markers and therefore theword will appear the same in all states:

State  | Indefinite | Definite
:------|:-----------|:---------
u-state| [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَىٰ]{.ar}
a-state| [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَىٰ]{.ar}
i-state| [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْغَضْبَىٰ]{.ar}

Partially-changing nouns usually form their feminine using a different feminine marker than looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. They will either use 

+ [ىٰ]{.ar} [aa]{.trn}, as we've just seen, or
+ [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn}.

In both cases, the masculine noun is modified before adding the feminine marker. In the case of [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} we removed the last part of the word [ان]{.ar} [An]{.trn} before adding the feminine marker. This modification follows a standard pattern which will be easy to learn, if Allah wills.

Here is an example of a partially-changing noun [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar} [EaHmaru]{.trn} "red" which forms its feminine with the [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} feminine marker.

State  | Masc. indefinite | Masc. definite | Fem. indefinite | Fem. definite |
:------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------
u-state| [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْأَحْمَرُ]{.ar}| [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْحَمْرَاءُ]{.ar}
a-state| [أَحْمَرَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْأَحْمَرَ]{.ar}| [حَمْرَاءَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْحَمْرَاءَ]{.ar}
i-state| [أَحْمَرَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْأَحْمَرِ]{.ar}| [حَمْرَاءَ]{.ar} | [ٱَلْحَمْرَاءِ]{.ar}

In this case, the initial [alif]{.trn} of [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar} [EaHmaru]{.trn} was removed and some of the vowel marks were changed before adding the feminine marker [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} to get the feminine [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar} [HamrAEu]{.trn}. This modification too is standard for words of this pattern.

It is important to note that [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are not always feminine markers. They are often an integral part of a word, in which case the noun may be masculine. For example, [ٱَلْهُدَىٰ]{.ar} [alhudA]{.trn} "the guidance" is a masculine noun and [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} here is not a feminine marker. We will be able to tell when [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn} and [اء]{.ar} [AE]{.trn} are feminine markers and when not with more knowledge of word patterns, if Allah wills.

These all have the same pattern as [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar} [EaHmaru]{.trn} and form their feminine on the same pattern as [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar} [HamrAEu]{.trn}.


The word [غَصْبَالنُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} has the three-letter root [غ-ض-ب]{.ar}.

In Arabic studies, the root [ف-ع-ل]{.ar} is used to show patterns

One category of nouns has an intensive meaning "very angry, "very hungry". These all have the same pattern as [غَصْبَالنُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn}. They end with [ان]{.ar} [An]{.trn} and form their feminine by removing the ending and adding [ىٰ]{.ar} [A]{.trn}.

The other category is of colors and physical characteristics and disabilities. These all have the same pattern as [أَحْمَرُ]{.ar} [EaHmaru]{.trn} and form their feminine on the same pattern as [حَمْرَاءُ]{.ar} [HamrAEu]{.trn}.

These two categories are among the most common types of partially-changing souns. 

It is, however, important to note that not all descriptive nouns with intensive meanings, or meanings of colors or physical characteristics follow these patterns. In such cases,

Let's see some examples of partially changing nouns in use.

## Partially-changing nouns in the i-state

So if an indefinite partially changing noun in the i-state is identical with the a-state, is it still important to know when the noun is in the i-state? Yes it is.
