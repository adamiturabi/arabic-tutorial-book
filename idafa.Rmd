# The chaining of nouns

## Introduction

In Arabic we may chain two or more nouns in a sequence to establish an "of" relationship between them, in order to express, for example,

+ "the mother of the boy", or, equivalently" "the boy's mother".
+ "a house of a man", or, equivalently, "a man's house".
+ "the sword of Zayd", or equivalently, "Zayd's sword".

In English, as you can see there we can express this relationship using the word "of" or using apostrophe-s "'s" between two nouns. In some phrases, using apostrophe-s is more natural than using the word "of".

In Arabic we express these types of phrases by chaining the two together thus:

[أُمُّ ٱلْغُلَامِ]{.ar}  
[Eummu -lgulAmi]{.trn}  
"the mother of the boy", or, equivalently" "the boy's mother"

The first noun in the chain is the noun before "of" and the second noun in the chain is the noun after "of".

The first noun in the chain has neither an [n]{.trn} mark, or an [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, and the second noun in the chain will be in the i-state. The first noun may be in any state, depending on its function in the sentence. For example,

+ [وَجَدَ أُمَّ ٱلْغُلَامِ.]{.ar}  
  [wajada Eumma -lgulAmi.]{.trn}  
  "He found the boy's mother." (Note that [أُمَّ]{.ar} is in the a-state.)
+ [ذَهَبَتْ إِلَىٰ أُمِّ ٱلْغُلَامِ.]{.ar}  
  [pahabat EilA Eummi -lgulAmi.]{.trn}  
  "She went to the boy's mother." (Note that [أُمِّ]{.ar} is in the i-state.)
