# The verbal-nouns of the doer and the doee

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we studied the verbal-noun of doing. In this chapter we shall study two more kinds of verbal-nouns. These are the doer verbal-noun and the doee-verbal noun. These, too, are nouns that can give the meaning of the verb they are derived from. In places, they may even substitute the verb, thereby adding some nuances in meaning.

The doer verbal-noun gives the meaning of the doer, that is the person doing the action of the verb. For example, for the verb [قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ قِرَاءَةً]{.ar} [qaraEa yaqraEu qirAEatan]{.trn} "to read", the doer verbal-noun is [قَارِئٌ]{.ar} [qAriEun]{.trn} "a reader".

## Pattern of the doer verbal-noun

We saw in the previous chapter that the pattern for the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs was very variable. In contrast, the pattern for the doer verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs is fixed. It is always on the pasttern [فَاعِلٌ]{.ar} [fAeilun]{.trn}. Also, the doer verbal-noun is modified for gender and number. It takes sound plurals: the [-Un]{.trn} for the masculine, and the [-At]{.trn} plural for the feminine. Here is a table showing these modifications for the u-state. You should be able to extend them for the a-state and i-state.

| Number | Masculine | Feminine |
|:---|:---|:---|
|singular|[فَاعِلٌ]{.ar} [fAeilun]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَةٌ]{.ar} [fAeilatun]{.trn}|
|dual|[فَاعِلَانِ]{.ar} [fAeilAni]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَتَانِ]{.ar} [fAeilatAni]{.trn}|
|plural|[فَاعِلُونَ]{.ar} [fAeilUna]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَاتٌ]{.ar} [fAeilAtun]{.trn}|

## The doer verbal-noun as a noun

Like the doing verbal-noun, the doer verbal noun occupies a place that is between a noun and a verb. The basic, most essential, meaning of the doer verbal noun is that of a noun which denotes the doer of the verb.

So, for example, the doer verbal-noun of the verb [سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا]{.ar} [saEala yasEalu suEAlan]{.trn} "to question" is [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} [sAEilun]{.trn}. Since it refers to the doer of this verb, we can translate it as "a questioner~m.~".

By itself, the word [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} [sAEilun]{.trn} "a questioner" just denotes a noun. It does not indicate when the doer does the action of the verb: has the questioner already asked the question, is he asking it at present, or will he ask it in the future. So, for example, we can say:

[سَيَقْدَمُ سَائِلٌ وَسَيَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا.]{.ar}  
[sayaqdamu sAEilun wasayaqdamu suEAlan.]{.trn}  
"A questioner~m.~ will arrive and he will ask a question."

In the above sentence, the doer verbal-noun is being described as performing the action of the verb in the future.

Here is another example:

[سَأَلَتِ ٱلْفَقِيهَ سَائِلَةٌ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
[saEalati -lfaqIha sAEilatun ean Eamrin.]{.trn}  
"A questioner~f.~ asked the jurist about a matter."

In the above sentence, the doer verbal-noun is being described as having performed the action of the verb in the past.

Doer verbal-nouns of form\ 1 verbs, when used with this noun meaning, often have broken plurals, in addition to their sound plurals. Generally, either could be used in most cases, but the usage of the broken plurals is preferred.

For example, the doer verbal-noun of the verb [قَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا]{.ar} [qatala yaqtulu qatlan]{.trn} "to kill ([ه]{.ar} s.o.)" is [قَاتِلٌ]{.ar} [qAtilun]{.trn} "a killer~m.~". Its sound plural is [قَاتِلُونَ]{.ar} [qAtilUna]{.trn} and its broken plurals are [قُتَّالٌ]{.ar} [quttAlun]{.trn} and [قَتَلَةٌ]{.ar} [qatalatun]{.trn}. Any of these could be used but the broken plural is often preferred.

[هَرَبَ قَتَلَةُ ٱلرَّجُلِ إِلَىٰ مَخْبَئِهِمْ.]{.ar}  
[haraba qatalatu -rrajuli EilA maxbaEihim.]{.trn}  
"The killers of the man fled to their hideout."

## The doer verbal-noun as a verb

We have learned that the essential meaning of the doer verbal-noun is the doer of the action of the verb from which it is derived. In addition to this essential meaning, the doer verbal-noun can also be used in place of the verb from which it is derived. This is only done when the verb to be replaced is the incomplete-action verb. The doer verbal-noun does not replace the completed-action verb. We will now explain this usage.

### The doer verbal-noun of verbs of posture and motion

Consider the following sentence:

[يَذْهَبُ زَيْدٌ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[yaphabu zaydun Eila -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"Zayd goes to school."

The above sentence does not explicitly specify whether Zayd is actually going to school at present, or that he goes to school habitually and not necessarily right now.

If we wish to indicate that Zayd is actually going to school at present we can replace the incomplete-action verb with the indefinite doer verbal-noun. So we get:

[زَيْدٌ ذَاهِبٌ إِلَى ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[yaphabu zaydun Eila -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"Zayd is going to school."

Note that the same preposition [إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [EilA]{.trn} "to" is used with the doer verbal-noun as is used with the verb.

This usage of the doer verbal-noun to indicate that the action of the verb is ocurring at present is mostly done for what we call _verbs of posture_ and _verbs of motion_.

Verbs of posture denote a static position of the doer's body and include verbs like sitting, standing, lying down, sleeping, etc.

Verbs of motion denote a moving action of the doer's body and include verbs like
going, coming, running, etc.

So, if, for example, we say,

[زَيْنَبُ جَالِسَةٌ عَلَى هَـٰذَا ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.]{.ar}  
[zaynabu jAlisatun eala hApa -lkursiyyi.]{.trn}  
"Zaynab is sitting on this chair."

this indicates that Zaynab is sitting on this chair at present. And if we say,

[تَجْلِسُ زَيْنَبُ عَلَى هَـٰذَا ٱلْكُرْسِيِّ.]{.ar}  
[tajlisu zaynabu eala hApa -lkursiyyi.]{.trn}  
"Zaynab sits on this chair."

this indicates that Zaynab usually sits on this chair.

If this usage of the doer verbal-noun to indicate a present action is mostly only for verbs of posture and motion, how then do we indicate this tense for other verbs? We have answered this in section [TODO: add section to incomplete-action verb] where we said that in order to give the meaning that the action of the verb is happening right now, a verbal sentence can be converted to a subject-information sentence. 

### Usage of the doer verbal-noun as a future tense verb

The doer verbal-noun may be used in place of the verb it is derived from to indicate an intent on the part of the doer, or to indicate that the action will occur in the future.

This usage of the doer verbal-noun is not just for verbs of posture and motion like the present tense usage. Rather, it is for all verbs in general.

And since intention is something that is mostly expressed by the speaker for hiimself, rather than for someone else, we will often find this usage with the subject [أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} "I".

#### With an indirect doee

Here is an example of the usage of the doer verbal-noun as a future tense verb with an indirect doee:

<!--
[فَرَغْتُ مِنْ عَمَلِي فَأَنا ذَاهِبٌ  إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[faragtu min eamalI faEana pAhibun Eila -lbayti.]{.trn}  
"I have got done with my work so I'm going home."

The context would tell us whether the person is talking about his intention to go home in the immediate future, or whether he has already started and is going home at present.
-->

[أَنَا ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ صَدِيقِي فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ.]{.ar}  
[Eana pAhibun EilA bayti SadIqI fi -SSabAHi.]{.trn}  
"I'm going to go to my friend's house in the morning."

In the above sentence it is possible for the phrase 
[فِي ٱلصَّبَاحِ]{.ar}
[fi -SSabAHi]{.trn}
"in the morning"
to be ommitted for the same meaning. In that case, surrounding context could tell us that the person is intending to go in the future, and is not actually in the process of going there at present.

Here is another example (by a female speaker):

[عِنْدِي كُرَةٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ فَأَنَا رَاجِعَةٌ إِلَى ٱلْبَيْتِ وَلَاعِبَةٌ بِهَا.]{.ar}  
[eindI kuratun fi -lbayti faEana rAjieatun Eila -lbayti walAeibatun bihA.]{.trn}  
"I have a ball at home, so I'm going to go home and play with it."

#### Difference with the particles [سَـ]{.ar} [sa-]{.trn} and [سَوْفَ]{.ar} [sawfa]{.trn}

We have already learned a method to express a future action using the particles [سَـ]{.ar} [sa-]{.trn} and [سَوْفَ]{.ar} [sawfa]{.trn} with the incomplete-action verb. So we could also have said:

[سَأَذْهَبُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ صَدِيقِي.]{.ar}  
[saEaphabu EilA bayti SadIqI.]{.trn}  
"I will to go to my friend's house."

The difference between this using the particles [سَـ]{.ar} [sa-]{.trn} and [سَوْفَ]{.ar} [sawfa]{.trn} and using the doer verbal-noun is that using the doer verbal-noun signifies more emphasis, or, as a possible consequence of the emphasis, that the action is more imminent. That is:

[أَنَا ذَاهِبٌ ...]{.ar}  
[Eana pAhibun ...]{.trn}  
"I will [definitely] go ..."  
or  
"I'm going to go ..."

[سَأَذْهَبُ ...]{.ar}  
[saEaphabu ...]{.trn}  
"[Soon] I will go ..."

#### With a direct doee

If a verb takes a direct doee, and we wish to use the direct doee with the verb's doer verbal-noun when the doer verbal-noun is acting as a verb, then we may deal with it in one of three ways:

1. The direct doee in a-state following the doer verbal-noun

   The most basic method of dealing with a direct doee of a doer verbal noun is by placing it in the a-state right after the doer verbal-noun. Here is an example,
   
   [قَدْ دَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ رَجُلٌ شَرِيرٌ. هُوَ **قَاتِلٌ سُكَّانَهَا**.]{.ar}  
   [qad daxala -lmadInata rajulun carIrun. hua qAtilun sukkAnahA.]{.trn}  
   "An evil man has entered the city. He is going to kill its residents."
   
   <!-- Wright says: When the اسم الفاعل is indefinite then مفعول به منصوب is only allowed under certain scenarios: The اسم الفاعل is a خبر or other attribute, or a negative sentence, or a question. (vol. ii, § 30, p. 65). This seems similar to prohibition of indef subjects so I don't think it is necessary to add that detail here. It seems like doer verbal-noun will naturally be a predicate.-->

2. The direct doee in i-state annexed to the doer verbal-noun

   The combination of the doer verbal-noun and following direct doee in the a-state is often replaced with an annexation of the doer verbal-noun to the i-state direct doee. So, for example, instead of the above example, we can say:
   
   [قَدْ دَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ رَجُلٌ شَرِيرٌ. هُوَ **قَاتِلُ سُكَّانِهَا**.]{.ar}  
   [qad daxala -lmadInata rajulun carIrun. hua qAtilu sukkAnihA.]{.trn}  
   "An evil man has entered the city. He is going to kill its residents."

   Note that [قَاتِلُ سُكَّانِهَا]{.ar} [qAtilu sukkAnihA.]{.trn} can also support the non-verbal meaning of the doer verbal-noun: "killer of its residents", i.e., he has already killed its residents in the past. So, when an annexation is used with a doer verbal-noun, we will often need surrounding context to tell us whether the verbal (incomplete-action) meaning is intended, or the noun  meaning.

   This usage of annexing the doer verbal-noun to the i-state direct doee instead of employing the more basic usage of the doer verbal-noun and a following a-state direct doee is optional, but fairly common. In fact, when the doer-verbal noun ends with an [n]{.trn}-mark, and the direct doee begins with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} "the", then the annexation usage becomes predominant over the basic a-state usage. So we will be more likely to see:

   [أَنَا فَاعِلُهُ.]{.ar}  
   [Eana fAeiluhu.]{.trn}  

   instead of:

   [أَنَا فَاعِلٌ إِيَّاهُ.]{.ar}  
   [Eana fAeilun EiyyAhu.]{.trn}  

   for the meaning: "I will do it." Note again, that the latter sentence could also support the noun meaning of the doer-verbal noun: "I am its doer.", i.e., "the one who did it."

   Similarly, it will be more common to find:

   [هُوَ قَاتِلُ ٱلنَّاسِ.]{.ar}  
   [huwa qAtilu -nnAsi.]{.trn}  

   instead of:

   [هُوَ قَاتِلٌ ٱلنَّاسَ.]{.ar}  
   [huwa qAtiluni -nnAsa.]{.trn}  

   for the meaning: "He is going to kill the people." Note, once again, that the latter sentence also supports the meaning: "He is the people's killer.", i.e., "the one who killed them", and that context would be needed to tell us which of the two meanings is intended.

   The annexation of a doer verbal-noun to its direct doee in the i-state is not the kind of "proper" annexation that we have learned so far. In fact, it is called an _improper annexation_ and we shall study it in more detail in chapter [TODO], if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

3. Quite similar to what we learned in section\ \@ref(the-direct-doee-in-i-state-preceded-by-the-preposition-%D9%84-li) for doing verbal-nouns, the direct doee can follow the doer verbal-noun in the i-state preceded by the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}.

   <!--Quran:  إنل له لحافظون -->
   This is often optional, as an alternative to the above two methods. For example,
   
   [هُوَ قَاتِلٌ لَهُمْ.]{.ar}  
   [huwa qAtilun lahum.]{.trn}  
   "He will kill them."
   
   Using [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} in this manner is also a technique to move the direct doee before the doer verbal-noun for effect, if desired. For example,
   
   [هُوَ لَهُمْ قَاتِلٌ.]{.ar}  
   [huwa lahum qAtilun.]{.trn}  
   "He will kill them."

### The definite doer verbal-noun as a verb

<!-- from Quran:  الكاظمين الغيظ ، المؤتون الزكاة , many be improper annexxation too -->
So far we have seen only an indefinite doer verbal-noun being used with the meaning of an incomplete-action verb. However, the definite doer verbal-noun, too, can give this meaning. The meaning is often in the present tense. Here are some examples:

With an indirect doee:

[قَدِمَ زَيْدٌ ٱلذَّاهِبُ إِلَى ٱلْجَامِعَةِ.]{.ar}  
[qadima zayduni -ppAhibu Eila -ljAmieati.]{.trn}  
"Zayd, the one who goes to the university, has arrived."

With a direct doee in the a-state:

[هَرَبْتُ مِنَ ٱلْأَسَدِ ٱلْآكِلُ ٱلْإِنْسَانَ.]{.ar}  
[harabtu mina -lEasadi -lEAkilu -lEinsAna.]{.trn}  
"I fled from the lion, the one that eats man."

With a direct doee in the i-state preceded by the preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn}:
<!--[قَدْ سَفِهَ ٱلْفَاسِقُ ٱلشَّارِبُ لِلْخَمْرِ.]{.ar}  
[qad safiha -lfAsiqu -ccAribu lilxamri.]{.trn}  
"The evil-doer, the one who drinks wine, has become foolish."-->

[سَيَنْجَحُ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلتَّارِكُ لِلَّهْوِ.]{.ar}  
[sayanjaHu -TTAlibu -ttAriku lillahwi.]{.trn}  
"The student, the one who leaves idle amusement, will succeed."

### Plurals of the doer verbal-noun when used as a verb

We mentioned in section\ \@ref(the-doer-verbal-noun-as-a-noun) that doer-verbal nouns when used with their noun meaning often have broken plurals along with their sound plural.
We gave the example of the doer verbal-noun
[قَاتِلٌ]{.ar} [qAtilun]{.trn} "a killer~m.~" with the sound plural is [قَاتِلُونَ]{.ar} [qAtilUna]{.trn} and the broken plurals [قُتَّالٌ]{.ar} [quttAlun]{.trn} and [قَتَلَةٌ]{.ar} [qatalatun]{.trn}.

When the doer verbal-noun is used as a verb, only the sound plural is permitted to be used, and the broken plurals, if any are not used. So we can only say:

[هُمْ قَاتِلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ.]{.ar}  
[hum qAtilUna -nnAsa.]{.trn}  
and  
[هُمْ قَاتِلُو ٱلنَّاسِ.]{.ar}  
[hum qAtilu -nnAsi.]{.trn}  
for  
"They will kill the people."

(In the second sentence, the [ن]{.ar} of [قَاتِلُونَ]{.ar} is ommitted because it is the first noun in a noun-chain.)

## Doer verbal-nouns re-used as common nouns

The doer verbal-noun is often re-used as a common noun with a meaning that is either directly, or indirectly related to the meaning of the verb. For example, the doer verbal-noun of the verb [سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا]{.ar} [saEala yasEalu suEAlan]{.trn} is [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} "a questioner" with the sound plural [سَائِلُونَ]{.ar} [sAEilUna]{.trn} and the broken plurals [سُؤَّالٌ]{.ar} [suEEAlun]{.trn} and [سَأَلَةٌ]{.ar} [saEalatun]{.trn}.

The word [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} "a questioner" is re-used with the meaning "a beggar". The association in meaning is that a beggar continually asks people for money. 

When a doer verbal-noun is re-used as a common noun then only the broken plural, if it exists, may be used. The sound plural is only permitted to be used if no broken plurals exist. Here are some more examples of doer verbal-nouns re-used as common nouns:
<!--
