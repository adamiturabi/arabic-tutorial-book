# The verbal-nouns of the doer and the doee

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we studied the verbal-noun of doing. In this chapter we shall study two more kinds of verbal-nouns. These are the doer verbal-noun and the doee-verbal noun. These, too, are nouns that can give the meaning of the verb they are derived from. In places, they may even substitute the verb, thereby adding some nuances in meaning.

The doer verbal-noun gives the meaning of the doer, that is the person doing the action of the verb. For example, for the verb [قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ قِرَاءَةً]{.ar} [qaraEa yaqraEu qirAEatan]{.trn} "to read", the doer verbal-noun is [قَارِئٌ]{.ar} [qAriEun]{.trn} "a reader".

## Pattern of the doer verbal-noun

We saw in the previous chapter that the pattern for the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs was very variable. In contrast, the pattern for the doer verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs is fixed. It is always on the pasttern [فَاعِلٌ]{.ar} [fAeilun]{.trn}. Also, the doer verbal-noun is modified for gender and number. It takes sound plurals: the [-Un]{.trn} for the masculine, and the [-At]{.trn} plural for the feminine. Here is a table showing these modifications for the u-state. You should be able to extend them for the a-state and i-state.

| Number | Masculine | Feminine |
|:---|:---|:---|
|singular|[فَاعِلٌ]{.ar} [fAeilun]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَةٌ]{.ar} [fAeilatun]{.trn}|
|dual|[فَاعِلَانِ]{.ar} [fAeilAni]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَتَانِ]{.ar} [fAeilatAni]{.trn}|
|plural|[فَاعِلُونَ]{.ar} [fAeilUna]{.trn}|[فَاعِلَاتٌ]{.ar} [fAeilAtun]{.trn}|

## Usage of the doer verbal-noun

Like the doing verbal-noun, the doer verbal noun occupies a place that is between a noun and a verb. The basic, most essential, meaning of the doer verbal noun is that of a noun which denotes the doer of the verb.

So, for example, the doer verbal-noun of the verb [سَأَلَ يَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا]{.ar} [saEala yasEalu suEAlan]{.trn} "to question" is [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} [sAEilun]{.trn}. Since it refers to the doer of this verb, we can translate it as "a questioner".

By itself, the word [سَائِلٌ]{.ar} [sAEilun]{.trn} "a questioner" just denotes a noun. It does not indicate when the doer does the action of the verb: has the questioner already asked the question, is he asking it at present, or will he ask it in the future. So, for example, we can say:

[سَيَقْدَمُ سَائِلٌ وَسَيَسْأَلُ سُؤَالًا.]{.ar}  
[sayaqdamu sAEilun wasayaqdamu suEAlan.]{.trn}  
"A questioner will come and will ask a question."

In the above sentence, the doer verbal-noun is being described as performing the action of the verb in the future.

Here is another example:

[سَأَلَ ٱلْفَقِيهَ سَائِلٌ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
[saEala -lfaqIha sAEilun ean Eamrin.]{.trn}  
"A questioner asked the jurist about a matter."

In the above sentence, the doer verbal-noun is being described as having performed the action of the verb in the past.

The doer verbal-noun may be placed in a noun-chain, just as any other noun, withits basic, noun, meaning. For example,
