# The verbal-nouns of the doer and the doee

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we studied the verbal-noun of doing. In this chapter we shall study two more kinds of verbal-nouns. These are the doer verbal-noun and the doee-verbal noun. These, too, are nouns that can give the meaning of the verb they are derived from. In places, they may even substitute the verb, thereby adding some nuances in meaning.

The doer verbal-noun gives the meaning of the doer, that is the person doing the action of the verb. For example, for the verb [قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ قِرَاءَةً]{.ar} [qaraEa yaqraEu qirAEatan]{.trn} "to read", the doer verbal-noun is [قَارِئٌ]{.ar} [qAriEun]{.trn} "a reader".
