# Usage and style

## There is a ...

In English the plain existence of an indefinite subject is expressed using the word "there". For example:

i.   "There is a gloom in the house"
ii.  "There is a type of confidence which is good and [there is] a type of confidence which is bad.
iii. "There is a god."

The word "there" in these examples does not indicate a specific place. Rather it signifies existence. As if to say:

i.   "A gloom exists in the house."
ii.  "A type of confidence exists which is good and a type of confidence exists which is bad.
iii. "A god exists."

Expressing such sentences in Arabic can sometimes be tricky. 
There is a modern tendency to use the words [Parf makan]{.trn2} [هُنَاكَ]{.ar} and the [majhUl]{.trn2} verb [يُوجَدُ]{.ar} as direct equivalents of the English "there" and "exists" respectively.
So one might find:

i.   [هُنَاكَ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ.]{.ar} or   
     [يُوجَدُ حَزَنٌ فِي ٱلْبَيتِ.]{.ar}

In Classical Arabic, expressing such sentences falls under the category of sentences with indefinite subjects.
We have discussed this topic in chapter\ \@ref(chap-indef-subjects).

If, of course, a place is intended by "there" then there is no problem using [هُنَاكَ]{.ar} or its synonyms. For example:

[أَثَمَّ زَيْدٌ؟]{.ar}  

Similarly, [يُوجَدُ]{.ar} may be used with no problem if the meaning "is (to be) found" is intended. For example:

[من قتل معاهدا لم يرح رائحة الجنة، وإن ريحها توجد من مسيرة أربعين عاماً]{.ar}
