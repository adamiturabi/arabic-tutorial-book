# The connected noun

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the man."

If the listener (or reader) can identify 
the individual referred to by the noun "the man"
(maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker),
then there is no problem with this sentence.
But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring.
This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.

One way is to use an adjectival noun to describe the noun. For example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the _tall_ man."

Another way is to use a pointing noun, thus:

[رَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw _that_ man."

But sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. 
In this case, Arabic uses what is called a _connected noun_ and a _connector_. 
<!--A connected noun is itself a vague noun, which is then connected to by a qualifying sentence directly following it called the _connector_. 
The connector contains sufficient information to identify the individual intended by the speaker. -->
This example should help you understand what we mean:


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz', fig.ext='pdf', engine.opts = list(template = if (knitr::is_html_output()) "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua-html.tex" else "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua.tex")}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=2.0ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ} \txarb{ٱلَّذِي} \txarb{رَأَيْتُ ٱَلرَّجُلَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connector};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connected noun};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=13.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met yesterday.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the above sentence, the connected noun is [ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}.
It is applied to singular masculine nouns, like [ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
<!--It signifies a specific individual denoted by a singular masculine noun.-->
By itself it may be translated as "the one~1m~".
Sometimes in sentences it is left untranslated (as above) and an implied "who", "whom", "that", or "which" is used to aid the translation.
It is called a connected noun because it must be directly followed by a qualifying sentence that connects to it.

The qualifying sentence is called the connector and it contains the necessary information for the listener to correctly identify the individual intended by the speaker."
The connector in the above example is the sentence [لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ]{.ar} "I met him yesterday."

Note by the way, that we did not translate the pronoun "him" in our original translation (above). 
This is because it would sound unnatural in English to say: "I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met _him_ yesterday."
But this pronoun is an integral part of the Arabic connector and is called the _linking pronoun_. 
We will study it in detail in section\ \@ref(linking-pronoun) later in this chapter.

There are two types of connected nouns:

 1. The specific connected nouns
 2. The general connected nouns

We will study both these types separately within this chapter.

## Grammatical position of the connected noun

Consider again the same example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met  yesterday."

In this example, the connected noun
[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}
is a describer to the described noun
[ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
But connected nouns need not only occur as describers.
<!--They may occur as a subject, an information, a doer, a doee, following a preposition, and as a base noun in an annexation.-->
They may occur in various grammatical positions. 
Here are some examples:

As a subject:

[ٱَلَّذِي رَزَقَنَا بِٱلْأَمْسِ سَيَرْزُقُنَا بِالْغَدِ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (who) provided for us yesterday will provide for us tomorrow."

As an information:

[هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the [specific] one (whom) I met."

As a doer:

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing that) you said has reached us."

As a doee:

[نَهَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي أَسَاءَ.]{.ar}  
"I forbade the [specific] one (who) did evil."

Following a preposition:

[أَرَادَ أَنْ يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَهُمَا]{.ar}  
"he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them"  
(28:19)

As a base noun in an annexation:

[هَـٰذَا بَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the house of the [specific] one (whom) I met."
