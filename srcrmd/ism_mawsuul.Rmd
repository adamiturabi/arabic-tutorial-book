# The connected noun

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the man."

If the listener (or reader) can identify 
the individual referred to by the noun "the man"
(maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker),
then there is no problem with this sentence.
But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring.
This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.

One way is to use an adjectival noun to describe the noun. For example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the _tall_ man."

Another way is to use a pointing noun, thus:

[رَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw _that_ man."

But sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. 
In this case, Arabic uses what is called a _connected noun_ and a _connector_. 
<!--A connected noun is itself a vague noun, which is then connected to by a qualifying sentence directly following it called the _connector_. 
The connector contains sufficient information to identify the individual intended by the speaker. -->
This example should help you understand what we mean:


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz', fig.ext='pdf', engine.opts = list(template = if (knitr::is_html_output()) "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua-html.tex" else "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua.tex")}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=2.0ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ} \txarb{ٱلَّذِي} \txarb{رَأَيْتُ ٱَلرَّجُلَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connector};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connected noun};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=13.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met yesterday.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the above sentence, the connected noun is [ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}.
It is applied to singular masculine nouns, like [ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
<!--It signifies a specific individual denoted by a singular masculine noun.-->
By itself it may be translated as "the one~1m~".
Sometimes in sentences it is left untranslated (as above) and an implied "who", "whom", "that", or "which" is used to aid the translation.
It is called a connected noun because it must be directly followed by a qualifying sentence that connects to it.

The qualifying sentence is called the connector and it contains the necessary information for the listener to correctly identify the individual intended by the speaker."
The connector in the above example is the sentence [لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ]{.ar} "I met him yesterday."

Note by the way, that we did not translate the pronoun "him" in our original translation (above). 
This is because it would sound unnatural in English to say: "I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met _him_ yesterday."
But this pronoun is an integral part of the Arabic connector and is called the _linking pronoun_. 
We will study it in detail in section\ \@ref(linking-pronoun) later in this chapter.

There are two types of connected nouns:

 1. The specific connected nouns
 2. The general connected nouns

We will study both these types separately within this chapter.

## The specific connected nouns

The specific connected nouns have a significance which is restricted to a specific individual or category of individuals, 
and its connector should contain sufficient information to identify that specific individual.

The specific connected nouns is a group of nouns where each noun is applied to a gender and number of individuals. They are:

|Connected noun|Description|
|:--|:----------------|
|[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}|Singular masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَلَّتِي]{.ar} [EallatI]{.trn}|Singular feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Also used for plural non-intelligent beings of both genders. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّذَانِ]{.ar} [EallapAnI]{.trn}|Dual masculine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: [ٱَللَّذَيْنِ]{.ar} [Eallapayni]{.trn} in the a- and i-states. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّتَانِ]{.ar} [EallatAnI]{.trn}|Dual feminine. For both intelligent and non-intelligent beings. Flexible: [ٱَللَّتَيْنِ]{.ar} [Eallatayni]{.trn} in the a- and i-states. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling.|
|[ٱَلَّذِينَ]{.ar} [EallapIna]{.trn}|Plural masculine. For both intelligent beings. Rigid. Only one [ل]{.ar} in its spelling.|
|[ٱَللَّاتِي]{.ar} [EallAtI]{.trn} |For plural feminine intelligent beings. Also used for non-intelligent beings of both genders but [ٱَلَّتِي]{.ar} is more common there. Rigid. Two [ل]{.ar}'s in its spelling. Has the following variants: [ٱَللَّاتِ]{.ar} [EallAti]{.trn}, [ٱَللَّائِي]{.ar} [EallAEI]{.trn}, [ٱَللَّوَاتِي]{.ar} [EallawAtI]{.trn}|

### Grammatical position of the specific connected noun

Consider again the same example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met  yesterday."

In this example, the connected noun
[ٱَلَّذِي]{.ar} [EallapI]{.trn}
is a describer to the described noun
[ٱلرَّجُل]{.ar}.
But connected nouns need not only occur as describers.
<!--They may occur as a subject, an information, a doer, a doee, following a preposition, and as a base noun in an annexation.-->
They may occur in various grammatical positions. 
Here are some examples:
<!--
As a subject:

[ٱَلَّذِي رَزَقَنَا بِٱلْأَمْسِ سَيَرْزُقُنَا بِالْغَدِ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (who) provided for us yesterday will provide for us tomorrow."

As an information:

[هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the [specific] one (whom) I met."

As a doer:

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing that) you said has reached us."

As a doee:

[نَهَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي أَسَاءَ.]{.ar}  
"I forbade the [specific] one (who) did evil."

Following a preposition:

[أَرَادَ أَنْ يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَهُمَا]{.ar}  
"he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them"  
(28:19)

As a base noun in an annexation:

[هَـٰذَا بَيْتُ ٱلَّذِي لَقِيتُهُ.]{.ar}  
"This is the house of the [specific] one (whom) I met."
-->

As a subject:

[وَالَّذِنَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنْفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّـٰهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ]{.ar}  
"And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allāh - give them tidings of a painful punishment."  
9:34

As an information:

[خِيَارُ أَئِمَّتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَكُمْ]{.ar}  
"The best of your rulers are the ones (whom) you love and who love you"

As a doer:

[قَدْ بَلَغَنَا ٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
"The [specific] one (thing that) you said has reached us."

As a doee:

[رَبَّنَا أَرِنَا ٱللَّذَيْنِ أَضَلَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنْسِ]{.ar}  
"Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men"  
41:29

Following a preposition:

[أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ]{.ar}  
"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township"  
2:259

As a base noun in an annexation:

[قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّـٰهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا]{.ar}  
"Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., pleads] with you, [O Muḥammad]"  
58:1

## The connector and the linking pronoun

The connector is (typically) a sentence that directly follows the connected noun. 
As we mentioned in the introduction,
the connector provides clarifying information for the listener (or reader) to identify the individual referred to by the connected noun.

### Separating the connector from the connected noun

Generally, the connector directly follows the connected noun, as in all the examples we have given so far.
However, the connector may be separated from the connected noun by one of the following:

  i. An oath. For example:

     [جَاءَ ٱلَّذِي وَٱللَّـٰه قَهَرَ ٱلْأَعْدَاءَ.]{.ar}  
     "The one (who) - by [#allAh]{.trn2} - overpowered the enemies has come."

 ii. A sentence calling out to someone. For example,

     [أَنْتَ ٱلَّذِي يَا زَيْدُ فَتَحْتَ ٱلْبَابَ.]{.ar}  
     "You are the one - O Zayd - (who) opened the door."

iii. A parenthetical clause, which is a sentence within the main sentence that adds information to it, but which can be omitted without affecting the completeness of the main sentence. For example:

     [قَدِمَ ٱلَّذِي أَطَالَ ٱللَّـٰهُ عُمْرَهُ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيَّ.]{.ar}  
     "The one (who) - may Allah lengthen his age - was good to me has arrived."

     [قَدِمَ ٱلَّذِي وَهُوَ مُبْتَسِمٌ أَحْسَنَ إِلَيَّ.]{.ar}  
     "The one (who) - and he is smiling - was good to me has arrived."
     
### An incomplete sentence as the connector

The connector is, by default, a complete sentence. 
It is, however, allowed to be an incomplete sentence if it is one of the following:

 i. A prepositional phrase. For example:

    [نَامَ ٱلَّذِي فِي ٱلْغُرْفَةِ.]{.ar}  
    "The one (who is) in the room has slept."

    The connector is the incomplete sentence [فِي ٱلْغُرْفَةِ]{.ar} "(is) in the room".

ii. An adverbial phrase. For example:

    [تَكَلَّمَ ٱلَّذِي عِنْدَكَ.]{.ar}  
    "The one (who is) with you spoke."

    (Remember that [عِنْدَ]{.ar} is technically a noun used adverbially, not a preposition.)
    The connector is the incomplete sentence [عِنْدَكَ]{.ar} "(is) with you". 

In such cases, the incomplete sentence connector implcitly includes the meaning of a verb which is usually the verb "being", like "is", "are", "am", etc.

### The linker pronoun

In the connector is a pronoun that refers back to the connected noun.
This pronoun is called the _linker pronoun_.
It is an integral part of the connector.
However, sometimes it is possible to omit it, as we will see.
