# The connected noun

## Introduction

Consider the sentence:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the man."

If the listener (or reader) can identify 
the individual referred to by the noun "the man",
(maybe from a pre-existing mutual understanding with the speaker),
then there is no problem with this sentence.
But often, further clarification is needed for the listener to correctly identify the individual to whom the speaker is referring.
This further clarification can be provided in a number of ways.

One way is to use an adjectival noun to describe the noun. For example:

[رَأَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلَ ٱلطَّوِيلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw the _tall_ man."

Another way is to use a pointing noun, thus:

[رَأَيْتُ ذَ ٰلِكَ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
"I saw _that_ man."

But sometimes, a whole sentence is needed to provide the needed identification. 
In this case, Arabic uses what is called a _connected noun_. A connected noun is itself a vague noun, which is then connected to by a qualifying sentence directly following it called the _connector_. The connector contains sufficient information to identify the individual intended by the speaker. This example to help you understand what we mean:


```{r,echo=FALSE,engine='tikz', fig.ext='pdf', engine.opts = list(template = if (knitr::is_html_output()) "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua-html.tex" else "srctex/tikz2pdf-lua.tex")}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.text, decorations.pathreplacing}
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={text depth=0.25ex,text height=2.0ex}]
\path [decoration={text effects along path, 
  text=.\txarb{لَقِيتَهُ بِٱلْأَمْسِ} \txarb{ٱلَّذِي} \txarb{رَأَيْتُ ٱَلرَّجُلَ},
  text effects/.cd, 
    path from text, text along path,
    group letters, word count=\w,
    every word/.style={name=word-\w, execute at begin node=\strut}},
  decorate] (0,0);

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-1.south west) -- (word-1.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connector};

\draw [decoration={brace, mirror}, decorate] 
   (word-2.south west) -- (word-2.south east)
      node [midway, rotate=90, anchor=south, left=0ex, align=left] {\scriptsize connected noun};

\path (0,0) node [midway, below=13.5ex, right=0ex, align=left] {``I saw the [specific] man (whom) I met yesterday.''};

\end{tikzpicture}
```
