# Verbal nouns

## Introduction

Every verb has a set of _verbal-nouns_ derived from it that, despite being nouns, have a verbal meaning to them. In some cases, a verbal nouns may be used in place of the verb from which it is derived, thereby adding a nuance in meaning.

This set of verbal-nouns is:

1. The doing verbal-noun
2. The doer verbal noun
3. the doee verbal noun

## The doing verbal noun

### Introduction

Consider the following form\ 1 verb:

| Root | Completed-action verb | Incomplete-action verb (u-state)|
|:--|:----|:-----|
|[ذهب]{.arroot} | [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "he went" | [يَذْهَبُ]{.ar} [yaphabu]{.trn} "he goes"|

The doing verbal-noun associated with this verb is [ذَهَابٌ]{.ar} [pahAbun]{.trn}. It denotes "the action of going", or simply "going". In this section we shall learn how this and other verbal-nouns are used.

Before we proceed, we present a new method to present a verb and its meaning in this book. Instead of giving the above table when presenting a verb, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar}  
[pahaba yaphabu pahAban]{.trn}  
"to go"

The completed-action verb for the singular masculine absent person "he", the corresponding incomplete-action verb, and their doing verbal-noun are given together, in sequence. The doing verbal-noun is given in the a-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: "to go". 

### Patterns of the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs

The patterns of the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs are very variable. It is best to learn the doing verbal-noun when you learn a new verb. Having said that, there are some general trends which may be useful to keep in mind:

1. If the verb takes a direct doee, then the completed-action verb must necessarily be of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} or [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn} (because completed-action verbs of the pattern [فَعُلَ]{.ar} [faeula]{.trn} never take a direct doee). In this case:
   a. The doing verbal-noun for many verbs, in general, tends to be [فَعْلٌ]{.ar} [faelun]{.trn}. Examples:
      + [فَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا]{.ar} [fataHa yafTahu fatHan]{.trn} "to open ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [أَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا]{.ar} [Eaxapa yaExupu Eaxpan]{.trn} "to take ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [حَمِدَ يَحْمَدُ حَمْدًا]{.ar} [Hamida yaHmadu Hamdan]{.trn} "to praise ([ه]{.ar} s.o.)"
2. If the verb does not take a direct doee, then:
   a. If the completed-action verb is of the pattern [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the doing verbal-noun tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فَعَلٌ]{.ar} [faealun]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [تَعِبَ يَتْعَبُ تَعَبًا]{.ar} [taeiba yateabu taeaban]{.trn} "to become tired"
         + [جَزِعَ يَجْزَعُ جَزَعًا]{.ar} [jaziea yajzaeu jazaean]{.trn} "to be impatient"
         + [أَسِفَ يَأْسَفُ أَسَفًا]{.ar} [Easifa yaEsafu Easafan]{.trn} "to be sorrowful"
      ii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes being a color, then the doing verbal-noun is usually of the pattern [فُعْلَةٌ]{.ar} [fuelatun]{.trn}. Examples:
          + [خَضِرَ يَخْضَرُ خُضْرَةً]{.ar} [xaDira yaxDaru xuDratan]{.trn} "to be green"
          + [سَمِرَ يَسْمَرُ سُمْرَةً]{.ar} [xaDira yaxDaru xuDratan]{.trn} "to be brown"
      iii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some work or effort, then the doing verbal-noun tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}. Example:
           + [قَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ قُدُومًا]{.ar} [qadima yaqdamu qudUman]{.trn} "to arrive"
      iv. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some static quality, then the doing verbal-noun tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولَةٌ]{.ar} [fueUlatun]{.trn}. Example:
          + [يَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَةٌ]{.ar} [yabisa yaybasu yubUsatun]{.trn} "to be dry"
   a. If the completed-action verb is of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the doing verbal-noun tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [قَعَدَ يَقْعُدُ قُعُودًا]{.ar} [qaeada yaqeudu queUdan]{.trn} "to sit, stay back"
         + [سَجَدَ يَسْجُدُ سُجُودًا]{.ar} [sajada yasjudu sujUdan]{.trn} "to prostrate down"
         + [خَضَعَ يَخْضَعُ خُضُوعًا]{.ar} [xaDaea yaxDaeu xuDUean]{.trn} "to be humble"
