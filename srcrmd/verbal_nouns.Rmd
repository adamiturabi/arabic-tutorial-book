# Verbal nouns

## Introduction

Every verb has a set of _verbal-nouns_ derived from it that, despite being nouns, have a verbal meaning to them. In some cases, a verbal nouns may be used in place of the verb from which it is derived, thereby adding a nuance in meaning.

This set of verbal-nouns is:

1. The doing verbal-noun
2. The doer verbal noun
3. the doee verbal noun

## The doing verbal noun

### Introduction

Consider the following form\ 1 verb:

| Root | Completed-action verb | Incomplete-action verb (u-state)|
|:--|:----|:-----|
|[ذهب]{.arroot} | [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "he went" | [يَذْهَبُ]{.ar} [yaphabu]{.trn} "he goes"|

The doing verbal-noun associated with this verb is [ذَهَابٌ]{.ar} [pahAbun]{.trn}. It denotes "the action of going", or simply "going". In this section we shall learn how this and other verbal-nouns are used.

Before we proceed, we present a new method to present a verb and its meaning in this book. Instead of giving the above table when presenting a verb, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar}  
[pahaba yaphabu pahAban]{.trn}  
"to go"

The completed-action verb for the singular masculine absent person "he", the corresponding incomplete-action verb, and their doing verbal-noun are given together, in sequence. The doing verbal-noun is given in the a-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: "to go". 

### Patterns of the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs
