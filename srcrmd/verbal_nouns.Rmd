# Verbal nouns

## Introduction

Every verb has a set of _verbal-nouns_ derived from it that, despite being nouns, have a verbal meaning to them. In some cases, a verbal nouns may be used in place of the verb from which it is derived, thereby adding a nuance in meaning.

This set of verbal-nouns is:

1. The doing verbal-noun
2. The doer verbal noun
3. the doee verbal noun

 The doing verbal noun

## Introduction

Consider the following form\ 1 verb:

| Root | Completed-action verb | Incomplete-action verb (u-state)|
|:--|:----|:-----|
|[ذهب]{.arroot} | [ذَهَبَ]{.ar} [pahaba]{.trn} "he went" | [يَذْهَبُ]{.ar} [yaphabu]{.trn} "he goes"|

The doing verbal-noun associated with this verb is [ذَهَابٌ]{.ar} [pahAbun]{.trn}. It denotes "the action of going", or simply "going". In this section we shall learn how this and other verbal-nouns are used.

Before we proceed, we present a new method to present a verb and its meaning in this book. Instead of giving the above table when presenting a verb, we will say:

[ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar}  
[pahaba yaphabu pahAban]{.trn}  
"to go"

The completed-action verb for the singular masculine absent person "he", the corresponding incomplete-action verb, and their doing verbal-noun are given together, in sequence. The doing verbal-noun is given in the a-state, because of a usage that we shall learn in a later chapter, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills. This is how verb definitions are traditionally found in Arabic dictionaries. And the English meaning is given using the dictionary definition, in this case, the phrase: "to go". 

## Patterns of the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs

The patterns of the doing verbal-noun for form\ 1 verbs are very variable. It is best to learn the doing verbal-noun when you learn a new verb. Having said that, there are some general trends which may be useful to keep in mind:

1. If the verb takes a direct doee, then the completed-action verb must necessarily be of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn} or [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn} (because completed-action verbs of the pattern [فَعُلَ]{.ar} [faeula]{.trn} never take a direct doee). In this case:
   a. The doing verbal-noun for many verbs, in general, tends to be [فَعْلٌ]{.ar} [faelun]{.trn}. Examples:
      + [فَتَحَ يَفْتَحُ فَتْحًا]{.ar} [fataHa yafTahu fatHan]{.trn} "to open ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [أَخَذَ يَأْخُذُ أَخْذًا]{.ar} [Eaxapa yaExupu Eaxpan]{.trn} "to take ([هـ]{.ar} s.th.)"
      + [حَمِدَ يَحْمَدُ حَمْدًا]{.ar} [Hamida yaHmadu Hamdan]{.trn} "to praise ([ه]{.ar} s.o.)"
2. If the verb does not take a direct doee, then:
   a. If the completed-action verb is of the pattern [فَعِلَ]{.ar} [faeila]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the doing verbal-noun tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فَعَلٌ]{.ar} [faealun]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [تَعِبَ يَتْعَبُ تَعَبًا]{.ar} [taeiba yateabu taeaban]{.trn} "to become tired"
         + [جَزِعَ يَجْزَعُ جَزَعًا]{.ar} [jaziea yajzaeu jazaean]{.trn} "to be impatient"
         + [أَسِفَ يَأْسَفُ أَسَفًا]{.ar} [Easifa yaEsafu Easafan]{.trn} "to be sorrowful"
      ii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes being a color, then the doing verbal-noun is usually of the pattern [فُعْلَةٌ]{.ar} [fuelatun]{.trn}. Examples:
          + [خَضِرَ يَخْضَرُ خُضْرَةً]{.ar} [xaDira yaxDaru xuDratan]{.trn} "to be green"
          + [سَمِرَ يَسْمَرُ سُمْرَةً]{.ar} [xaDira yaxDaru xuDratan]{.trn} "to be brown"
      iii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some work or effort, then the doing verbal-noun tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}. Example:
           + [قَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ قُدُومًا]{.ar} [qadima yaqdamu qudUman]{.trn} "to arrive"
      iv. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes some static quality, then the doing verbal-noun tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولَةٌ]{.ar} [fueUlatun]{.trn}. Example:
          + [يَبِسَ يَيْبَسُ يُبُوسَةٌ]{.ar} [yabisa yaybasu yubUsatun]{.trn} "to be dry"
   a. If the completed-action verb is of the pattern [فَعَلَ]{.ar} [faeala]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the meaning of the verb does not fall under the cases ii., iii., and iv. (below), then the doing verbal-noun tends to be, in general, of the pattern [فُعُولٌ]{.ar} [fueUlun]{.trn}. Examples:
         + [قَعَدَ يَقْعُدُ قُعُودًا]{.ar} [qaeada yaqeudu queUdan]{.trn} "to sit, stay back"
         + [سَجَدَ يَسْجُدُ سُجُودًا]{.ar} [sajada yasjudu sujUdan]{.trn} "to prostrate down"
         + [خَضَعَ يَخْضَعُ خُضُوعًا]{.ar} [xaDaea yaxDaeu xuDUean]{.trn} "to be humble"
      ii. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes an ailment, then the doing verbal-noun is usually of the pattern [فُعَالٌ]{.ar} [fueAlun]{.trn}. Examples:
          + [سَعَلَ يَسْعُلُ سُعَالً]{.ar} [saeala yasealu sueAlan]{.trn} "to cough"

      iv. If, instead, the meaning of the verb denotes a sound, then the doing verbal-noun is usually of the pattern [فَعِيلٌ]{.ar} [faeIlun]{.trn} or [فُعَالٌ]{.ar} [fueAlun]{.trn}, or both. Examples:
          + [صَرَخَ يَصْرُخُ صَرِيخًا وَصُرَاخًا]{.ar} [Saraxa yaSruxu SarIxan waSurAxan]{.trn} "to scream"
3. If the verb denotes a craft or a profession or a rank, then the doing verbal-noun is often of the pattern [فِعَالَةٌ]{.ar} [fieAlatun]{.trn}. Examples:
   + [تَجَرَ يَتْجُرُ تِجَارَةً]{.ar} [tajara yatjuru tijAratan]{.trn} "to trade"
   + [أَمِرَ يَأْمَرُ إِمَارَةً]{.ar} [Eamira yaEmaru EimAratan]{.trn} "to be a commander"
4. If the completed-action verb is of the pattern [فَعُلَ]{.ar} [faeula]{.trn}, then the doing verbal noun tends to be of the pattern [فُعُولَةٌ]{.ar} [fueUlatun]{.trn} or [فَعَالَةٌ]{.ar} [faeAlatun]{.trn}. Examples:
   + [صَعُبَ يَصْعُبُ صُعُوبَةً]{.ar} [Saeuba yaSeubu SueUbatan]{.trn} "to be difficult"
   + [شَجُعَ يَشْجُعُ شَجَاعَةً]{.ar} [cajuea yacjueu cajAeatan]{.trn} "to be brave"

As mentioned earlier, these are only general trends and there are many verbs that have doing verbal-nouns which don't fall under the above rules.

## Usage of the doing verbal-noun

### State and definiteness

The doing verbal noun has properties of a noun, like state and definiteness. But it gives the meaning of a verb. For example, consider the verb [أَكَلَ يَأْكُلُ أَكْلًا]{.ar} [Eakala yaEkulu Eaklan]{.trn} "to eat". We can use its doing verbal noun in a sentence like this:

[فَرَغَ زَيْدٌ مِنَ ٱلْأَكْلِ.]{.ar}  
[faraga zaydun mina -lEakli.]{.trn}  
"Zayd got done with eating."

Note how the doing verbal noun [ٱلْأَكْلِ]{.ar} [EalEakli]{.trn} gives the meaning of the action of the verb "eating". But since it is a noun, it obeys the rules for nouns, like being in the i-state when preceded by the preposition [مِنْ]{.ar} [min]{.trn}.

Another point worth noting is that we have made it definite by saying [ٱَلْأَكْلِ]{.ar} [EalEakli]{.trn} instead of saying [أَكْلٍ]{.ar} [Eaklin]{.trn} for the meaning of "eating". This is because, as we explained in section 
\@ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns),
the definite noun is usually used in Arabic to give a general meaning, where in English we would not use "the". This may be a good time to re-read that section.

Having said that, the indefnite doing verbal-noun may be used too, and this will give the meaning of "a certain", or "a specific". For example, with the verb [عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا]{.ar} [eamila yaemalu eamalan]{.trn} "to work", we can say:

[فَرَغَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَعْبٍ.]{.ar}  
[faraga min eamalin Saebin.]{.trn}  
"He got done with a [certain] difficult work."

### With a doer

A doer may be used with the doing verbal-noun to show who is doing the action. In this case, the doing verbal-noun and the doer are usually placed in a noun-chain. The doing verbal-noun shall be the first noun and the doer shall be the second noun in the noun-chain. For example, consider the verb [قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ قِرَاءَةً]{.ar} [qaraEa yaqraEu qirAEatan]{.trn} "to read". We can say:

[سَمِعْتُ قِرَاءَةَ زَيْدٍ.]{.ar}  
[samietu qirAEata zaydin.]{.trn}  
"I heard Zayd's reading."

The doer may similarly be a pronoun, in which case, as usual, attached pronouns are used. So we can say:

[سَمِعْتُ قِرَاءَتَهُ.]{.ar}  
[samietu qirAEatahu.]{.trn}  
"I heard his reading."

### With an indirect doee

If a verb uses a particular preposition with indirect doees, and the doing verbal-noun of that verb is to be used with an indirect doee, then that same preposition is used with the doing verbal-noun.

For example the verb [ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar} [pahaba yaphabu pahAban]{.trn} "to go" is used with the preposition [إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [EilA]{.trn} "to" with an indirect doee to give the place to which the doer is going. This same preposition is then used with the doing verbal noun, thus:

[تَعِبْتُ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَابِ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ  ٱلْبَعِيدَةِ.]{.ar}  
[taeibtu mina -ppahAbi Eila -lmadInati -lbaeIdati.]{.trn}  
"I became tired from going to the far city."

If a doer is used along with the indirect doee, then the doer shall be placed in a noun chain with the doer verbal-noun, as explained in the previous section. For example,

[حَزِنْتُ مِنْ ذَهَابِ زَيْدٌ إِلَىٰ مَدِينَةٍ بَعِيدَةٍ.]{.ar}  
[Hazintu min pahAbi zaydin EilA madInatin baeIdatin.]{.trn}  
"I became sad from Zayd's going to a far city."
