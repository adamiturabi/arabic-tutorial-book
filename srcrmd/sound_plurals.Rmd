# Sound plurals

## Introduction

Arabic uses the plural for nouns in number three and higher. The formation and use of plurals in Arabic can be somewhat complicated. One of these complications is that, in using plurals, Arabic distinguishes between rational beings and non-rational beings. Rational beings are those living beings that are endowed with reason like humans, angels, and jinn. Non-rational beings include animals, inanimate objects, abstract concepts, etc.

As a further complication, there is sometimes more than one way to use plurals. In this chapter we will explain the most common usages to keep things as simple as possible.

English regularly forms the plural by adding the plural ending "s" to the end of a singular noun. For example:

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| book       | books      |
| house      | houses     |
| boy        | boys       |
| girl       | girls      |

Arabic also forms some plurals by adding plural endings to to the singular noun. This kind of plural is call a _sound_ plural because the singular noun is kept more or less sound (intact) when adding the plural ending.

Arabic has two sound plurals:

1. The [Un]{.trn} plural.
2. The [At]{.trn} plural.

We will describe each of them in detail.

## The [Un]{.trn} plural

The [Un]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـُونَ]{.ar} [Una]{.trn} to the singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـِينَ]{.ar} [Ina]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. For convenience, we will call it the "[Un]{.trn} plural" instead of the "[Una]{.trn}/[Ina]{.trn} plural".

| State | a (male) teacher | (male) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state |[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [mueallimUna]{.trn}| 
| a-state |[مُعَلِّمًا]{.ar} [muealliman]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [mueallimIna]{.trn} | 
| i-state |[مُعَلِّمٍ]{.ar} [mueallimin]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [mueallimIna]{.trn} |

Note that there are no [n]{.trn} marks for the [Un]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way:

| State | the (male) teacher | the (male) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar} [Ealmueallimu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimUna]{.trn}
| a-state | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَ]{.ar} [Ealmueallima]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimIna]{.trn}  
| i-state |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِ]{.ar} [Ealmueallimi]{.trn} | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimIna]{.trn}

### Applicability of the [Un]{.trn} plural

Except for very few exceptions, the [Un]{.trn} plural is used only for male rational beings. Of these exceptions, the word [سَنَةٌ]{.ar} [sanatun]{.trn} "a year" is the most common. It is pluralized as [سِنُونَ]{.ar} [sinUna]{.trn} in the u-state and [سِنِينَ]{.ar} [sinIna]{.trn} in the a-state and i-state.

## The [At]{.trn} plural

The [At]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـَاتٌ]{.ar} [Atun]{.trn} to the indefinite singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـَاتٍ]{.ar} [Atin]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state.

| State | an animal | animals
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}  | [حَيَوَانَاتٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtun]{.trn}
| a-state | [حَيَوَانًا]{.ar} [HayawAnan]{.trn} | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtin]{.trn} 
| i-state |[حَيَوَانٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnin]{.trn}   | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtin]{.trn} 

Note that there _are_ [n]{.trn} marks for the [At]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way but they won't have [n]{.trn} marks:

| State | the animal | the animals
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn}
| a-state | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَ]{.ar} [EalHayawAna]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}  
| i-state |[ٱَلْحَيَوَانِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAni]{.trn} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is removed before appending the [At]{.trn} plural ending:

| State | a (female) teacher | (female) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimatun]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَاتٌ]{.ar} [mueallimAtun]{.trn}
| a-state | [مُعَلِّمَةً]{.ar} [mueallimatan]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar} [mueallimAtin]{.trn}  
| i-state |[مُعَلِّمَةٍ]{.ar} [mueallimatin]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar} [mueallimAtin]{.trn} 

### The [At]{.trn} plural for words ending with [اء]{.ar}

If a noun ends with an [اء]{.ar} then the [hamzah]{.trn} may either be retained or get converted to a [و]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. This is done based on the same rules as for the dual which we explained in the previous chapter.

Thus,

+ REMOVE because plurals of qualitative nouns not yet discussed: [صَفْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SafrAE]{.trn} (root: [صفر]{.arroot}) becomes [صَفْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SafrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} (root: [صحر]{.arroot}) becomes [صَحْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [إِبْطًاءٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEun]{.trn} (root: [بطء]{.arroot}) becomes [إِبْطَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEAtun]{.trn}.
+ [سَمَاءٌ]{.ar} [samAEun]{.trn} (root: [سمو]{.arroot}) becomes [سَمَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAEAtun]{.trn} or [سَمَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAwAtun]{.trn}.

### The [At]{.trn} plural for words ending with [يٰ]{.ar}

If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar}, then whether the [ىٰ]{.ar} is a feminine marker or not, it becomes a [yAE]{.trn} with an [a]{.trn}-mark [يَ]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. For example,  

+ [حُبَارَىٰ]{.ar} [HubArA]{.trn} becomes [حُبَارَيَاتٌ]{.ar} [HubArayAtun]{.trn}.

### Designative nouns of the pattern [فَُِعْل]{.ar} and [فَُِعْلَة]{.ar}

If a designative noun is of the pattern [فَعْل]{.ar} [fael]{.trn} or [فَعْلَة]{.ar} [faelah]{.trn}, and the middle letter is not [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, then the $\emptyset$-mark on the middle letter will be converted to an [a]{.trn}-mark when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. Therefore, 

+ [نَحْلَة]{.ar} [naHlah]{.trn} becomes [نَحَلَات]{.ar} [naHalAt]{.trn}, not [نَحْلَات]{.ar} [naHlAt]{.trn}.

If a designative noun is of the pattern [فِعْل]{.ar} [fiel]{.trn}, [فِعْلَة]{.ar} [fielah]{.trn}, [فُعْل]{.ar} [fuel]{.trn}, or [فُعْلَة]{.ar} [fuelah]{.trn}, and the middle letter is not [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, then the $\emptyset$-mark on the middle letter can either:

  i.   be retained,
  ii.  be converted to an [a]{.trn} mark, or
  iii. be converted to the vowel mark on the first letter.

Thus,

+ [ظُلْمَة]{.ar} can become either [ظُلْمَات]{.ar} [PulmAt]{.trn} or [ظُلَمَات]{.ar} [PulamAt]{.trn}, or [ظُلُمَات]{.ar} [PulumAt]{.trn}.
+ [كِسْرَة]{.ar} can become either [كِسْرَات]{.ar} [kisrAt]{.trn} or [كِسَرَات]{.ar} [kisarAt]{.trn}, or [كِسِرَات]{.ar} [kisirAt]{.trn}.

Note that this rule of changing the vowel mark is only true for designative nouns. Qualitative nouns will retain the $\emptyset$-mark when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. So [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn} and [صَعْبَة]{.ar} [Saebah]{.trn} become only [صَعْبَات]{.ar} [SaebAt]{.trn}, not [صَعَبَات]{.ar} [SaeabAt]{.trn}.

### Applicability of the [At]{.trn} plural

We had mentioned that the [Un]{.trn} plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for male rational beings. Conversely, the [At]{.trn} is used for both female rational beings, and for non-rational beings (both masculine and feminine) like animals, inanimate objects, and abstract concepts. Rarely, it is also used for male rational beings.

Examples:

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimAtu fi -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"The female teachers are in the school."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ فِي ٱلْغَابَاتِ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnAtu fi -lgAbAti.]{.trn}  
"The animals are in the forests."

## Plurals of qualitative nouns

It is not just designative nouns that have plurals. Many qualitative nouns may be pluralized with sound plurals as well. For example, [طَيِّبٌ]{.ar} [Tayyibun]{.trn} has the [Un]{.trn} plural [طَيِّبُونَ]{.ar} [TayyibUna]{.trn} and the [At]{.trn} plural [طَيِّبَاتٌ]{.ar} [TayyibAtun]{.trn}. The complete rules of whether a qualitative noun has a sound plural are somwehat complicated. For now, you may use the following rule of thumb:

Only masculine qualitative nouns that form their feminine by the addition of [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [Un]{.trn} plural. And all feminine qualitative noun that ends with [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [At]{.trn} plural. But there do exist feminine qualitative nouns that don't end with [ة]{.ar} that form the [At]{.trn} plural. For example,

+ [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big (masc.)" forms its feminine with the addition of [ة]{.ar}: [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn}. Therefore it can be pluralized with the sound [Un]{.trn} plural [كَبِيرُونَ]{.ar}. And [كَبيرَةٌ]{.ar} can be pluralized as [كَبِيرَاتٌ]{.ar}.
+ [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} "very angry (masc.)" forms its feminine without [ة]{.ar}: [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}. Therefore it will not form the sound [Un]{.trn} plural.

In using plurals of qualitative nouns, Arabic distinguishes between rational beings and non-rational beings. Here we explain the usage of qualitative noun plurals with rational beings. We will explain the usage of qualitative noun plurals with non-rational beings in the next chapter, if Allah wills.

When a qualitative noun is describing plural rational beings, then the qualitative noun will be pluralized. For example,

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ طَيِّبُونَ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna TayyibUna]{.trn}  
"The male teachers are good."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَاتُ ٱلطَّوِيلَاتُ سَرِيعَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ljAriyAtu -TTawIlAtu sarIeAtin]{.trn}  
"The tall girls were fast."

## Pronouns for the plural

Here are the detached, attached, and doer pronouns for the plural:

|Person|Detached pronoun|Completed-action verb doer pronoun|Completed-action verb with doer pronoun|Attached pronoun|
|:---|:----|:----|:----|
| they/them~pl.\ masc.~ |[هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}        | [◌ُو]{.ar} [-U]{.trn}     |[فَعَلُوا]{.ar} [faealU]{.trn}     |[هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}|
| they/them~pl.\ fem.~  |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [hunna]{.trn}      | [نَ]{.ar} [-na]{.trn}     |[فَعَلْنَ]{.ar} [faealna]{.trn}     |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ masc.~       |[أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}   | [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}   |[فَعَلْتُمْ]{.ar} [faealtum]{.trn}   |[كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ fem.~        |[أَنْتُنَّ]{.ar} [Eantunna]{.trn} | [تُنَّ]{.ar}  [-tunna]{.trn}|[فَعَلْتُنَّ]{.ar} [faealtunna]{.trn} |[كُنَّ]{.ar} [-kunna]{.trn}|
| we/us~pl.\ masc.\ and fem.~ |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn}     | [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}    |[فَعَلْنَا]{.ar} [faealnA]{.trn}    |[نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}|


Here are some rules for the plural pronouns:

+ The plural attached and detached pronouns for the absent person "they/them~pl.\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}.
+ Similar to the singular and dual,the pronouns for the speaking person (we, us) do not differentiate between the masculine and feminine genders plural either.
+ The speaking person pronouns are the same for the dual and plural: [نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} and [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}.
+ Similar to [هُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}, [هُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}, the [u]{.trn}-mark on the plural attached pronoun [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark ([هِمْ]{.ar} [-him]{.trn}) when it is preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}. Examples: 
  + [عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}, [ealayhi]{.trn} "on him"
  + [فِيهِمْ]{.ar} [fIhim]{.trn} "in them~pl.~"
  + [بِهِمْ]{.ar} [bihim]{.trn} "with them~pl.~".
+ The final $\emptyset$-mark on the [مْ]{.ar} in the masculine plural pronouns ([هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}, [هُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}, [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}, [كُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}) becomes a [u]{.trn}-mark ([هُمُ]{.ar} [humu]{.trn}, [هُمُ]{.ar} [-humu]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمُ]{.ar} [Eantumu]{.trn}, [تُمُ]{.ar} [-tumu]{.trn}, [كُمُ]{.ar} [-kumu]{.trn} respectively) when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:
  + [هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.]{.ar}  
    [humu -lmueallimUna.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ are the (male) teachers."
+ The plural masculine verb doer pronoun for the absent person "they~pl.\ masc.~" [ـُوا]{.ar} [U]{.trn} has a silent [Ealif]{.trn} which is written only and not pronounced. This [Ealif]{.trn} is dropped when a doee pronoun is attached. For example: 
  + [ضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "They hit the man.
  + [ضَرَبُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabUhu.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The plural masculine verb doer pronoun for the addressed person "you~pl.\ masc.~" [تُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} becomes [تُمُو]{.ar} [tumU]{.trn} when a doee pronoun is attached. For example:
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabtumu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit the man."
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabtumUhu.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The [ن]{.ar} in the speaking participant attached pronoun "us" [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} is part of the pronoun and is not an intervening [ن]{.ar} as was the case for the singular speaking participant pronouns. So we get:
   + [عَلَيْنَا]{.ar} [ealaynA]{.trn} "on us"
   + [بِنَا]{.ar} [binA]{.trn} "with us"

  However, when attached to a word that ends with a [نْ]{.ar} with a $\emptyset$-mark, there is only one [ن]{.ar} written and it is doubled with a doubling mark [◌ّ]{.ar} on it. So we get:
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [مِنْ]{.ar} = [مِنَّا]{.ar} [minnA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [عَنْ]{.ar} = [عَنَّا]{.ar} [eannA]{.trn}
   + [نَا]{.ar} + [لَدُنْ]{.ar} = [لَدُنَّا]{.ar} [ladunnA]{.trn}
+ The preposition [لِ]{.ar} [li]{.trn} "for" becomes [لَ]{.ar} [la]{.trn} when followed by the plural attached pronouns:
   + [لَهُمْ]{.ar} [lahum]{.trn} "for them~3+~"
   + [لَكُمْ]{.ar} [lakum]{.trn} "for you~3+~"
   + [لَنَا]{.ar} [lanA]{.trn} "for us"
+ The plural speaking participant doer pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} is the same as the plural speaking participant attached pronoun [نَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}. But you can tell them apart because the doer pronoun, when attached to the verb, causes the final letter of the verb to have a $\emptyset$-mark. Consider the following two sentences:

  [سَأَلْنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalnA.]{.trn}  
  "We asked."

  [سَأَلَنَا.]{.ar}  
  [saEalanA.]{.trn}  
  "He asked us."


## Verbs with plural rational doers

Remember that in Arabic, a doer, whether a noun or a pronoun, always after a verb. 

[ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabU EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"They~pl.\ masc.~ went to a house."

When the doer is a plural noun then the plural doer pronoun is not employed.

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahabA -lmueallimUna EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"The teachers went to a house."

The above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a subject-information sentence. This gives more emphasis to the subject. In this case, the verb shall follow the subject and will need a doer pronoun after it.

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ ذَهَبُوا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna pahabU EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
"The teachers, they~pl.\ masc.~ went to a house."

If there are multiple verbs associated with the same doer in a verbal sentence, the doer noun will follow the first verb  and the rest of the verbs will have doer pronouns. For example:

[أَكَلَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ  وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[Eakala -rrajulAni wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The two men ate and they~pl.\ masc.~ drank and they~pl.\ masc.~ went."  
= "The two men ate and drank and went."

The above verbal sentence can be rearranged to be a subject-information sentence. In that case, all the verbs shall have doer pronouns. The sentence will have the same translation as above, except for an emphasis on the subject of the sentence.

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ أَكَلُوا وَشَرِبُوا وَذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna EakalU wacaribU wapahabU.]{.trn}  
"The two men, they~pl.\ masc.~ ate and they~pl.\ masc.~ drank and they~pl.\ masc.~ went."  
= "_The two men_ ate and drank and went."

### Verbs with multiple doers mentioned individually

If there are multiple doers of a verb, and each is mentioned individually, then there is often more than one way to handle them. Here we will give the more common usage.

If the verb is followed by multiple doers, only the first is the true doer with respect to  modifying the verb according to its gender and number. Examples:

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -lEummu wa-lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the boy went."

[ذَهَبَ ٱلْغُلَامُ وَٱلْأُمُّ .]{.ar}  
[pahaba -lgulAmu wa -lEummu.]{.trn}  
"The boy and the mother went."

If the doers consist of different persons (speaking person, addressed person, and absent person), then they are placed in order of strength: The speaking person is stronger than the addressed person, who is stronger than the absent person. The verb doer pronoun of the first (true) doer is then used. Example:
  
[ذَهَبْتُ أَنَا وَأَنْتَ وَهُوَ.]{.ar}  
[pahabtu Eana waEanta wahuwa.]{.trn}  
"I, you, and he went."

[أنْتَ وَهُوَ ذَهَبْتُمَا.]{.ar}  
[Eanta wahuwa pahabtumA.]{.trn}  
"You~sing.~ and he, you~dual~ went."

[أَنَا وَمُحَمَّدٌ ذَهَبْنَا.]{.ar}  
[Eana wamuHammadun pahabnA.]{.trn}  
"I and [#muHammad]{.trn2}, we went."

Note how the speaking person detached pronoun [أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} is used in addition to the doer pronoun [تُ]{.ar} [-tu]{.trn} in order to add [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} "and" to it.

If the verb follows the doers, then it will have the doer pronoun corresponding to number of the doers. Example:

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ذَهَبَتَا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu pahabatA.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the girl went."

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ ذَهَبْنَ.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatAni pahabna.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the two girls, they~pl.\ fem.~ went."

If the doers consist of both male and female persons, then the verb will have the masculine doer prenoun corresponding to the number of the doers. Example:

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ وَٱلْغُلَامُ ذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu wa-lgulAmu pahabU.]{.trn}  
"The mother, the girl, and the boy, they~pl.\ masc.~ went."
