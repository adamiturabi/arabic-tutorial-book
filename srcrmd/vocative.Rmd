# Calling out to someone

## Introduction

When directly addressing soneone in Arabic and calling out to him by name, the particle [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} is usually prefixed to the person's name. For example,

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا زَيْنَبُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA zaynabu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O Zaynab."

There are different rules regarding the state markings of the noun following [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} and we will describe them in the following sections.

## A specific person with a single word

### Using personal names

When a specific person is called out to, and the name used to call him consists of a single word, then that word shall be in the u-state. The sentence above is an example of this rule where the name [زَينَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} "Zaynab" is in the u-state.

If the word would have an [n]{.trn}-mark, then the [n]{.trn}-mark is dropped. So, for example, the name [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} "Zayd" usually has an [n]{.trn}-mark. But when used for being called out to, the [n]{.trn}-mark is dropped and it becomes:

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا زَيْدُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA zaydu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O Zayd."

### Using indefinite common nouns

The examples above show the person being called out to using a personal name. Instead of a personal name, a common noun can also be used with the same rule. Examples:

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا غُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA gulAmu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O you boy."

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا جَارِيَةُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA jAriyatu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O you girl."

In English, we have shown that a specific person is being called using the word "you", e.g., "O you boy". Duals and plurals are also allowed, again with the same rule:

[يَا رِجَالُ، قَدْ حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA rijAlu qad Hadava Eamrun.]{.trn}  
"O you men, a matter has occurred."

Note how the word [رِجَالُ]{.ar} [rijAlu]{.trn} "men" does not have an [n]{.trn}-mark because the word is used to call out to the specific persons.

Similarly,

[يَا لَاعِبَانِ بَدَأْتُمَا ٱللَّعِبَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُمَا ٱلْعَمَلَ.]{.ar}  
[yA lAeibAni badaEtuma -llaeiba wamA faealtuma -leamal.]{.trn}  
"O you players~2~, you have started playing and you have not done the work."

### Using definite common nouns and titles

When using a common noun to call out to a person, especially if the common noun is a title, it is often desired to make the common noun definite with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. In this case, the particle [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} is modified to [أَيُّهَا]{.ar} [EayyuhA]{.trn}, or sometimes [يَاأَيُّهَا]{.ar} [yAEayyuhA]{.trn} if it is in the beginning of a sentence. Examples:

[يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ، قَدْ فَعَلْتُ ٱلْوَاجِبَ.]{.ar}  
[yAEayyuha -lEustApu, qad faealtu -lwAjiba]{.trn}  
"O you the Professor, I have done the obligatory [work]."

[أَنَا سَقِيمٌ أَيُّهَا ٱلطَّبِيبُ.]{.ar}  
[Eana saqImun, Eayyuha -TTabIbu.]{.trn}  
"I am ill, O you the Doctor."

## An unspecified person with a single word

The above discussion pertains to calling out to specific persons. So for example, when you say,

<!--[يَا ظَالِمُ، عَذَابُ ٱللَّـٰهِ وَاقِعٌ.]{.ar}  -->
[يَا مُسْلِمُ، نَصْرُ ٱللَّـٰهِ قَرِيبٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA muslimu, naSru -llAhi qarIbun.]{.trn}  
"O you Muslim, the victory of [#allAh]{.trn2} is near."

then you are addressing a specific Muslim, who is perhaps in front of you. 

If an unspecified person or persons are being called out to with a single word, then instead of the u-state, the word is put into the a-state. Furthermore, the [n]{.trn}-mark, if any, is preserved. So if you want to address any unspecific Muslim, you will say:

[يَا مُسْلِمًا، نَصْرُ ٱللَّـٰهِ قَرِيبٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA musliman, naSru -llAhi qarIbun.]{.trn}  
"O [any] Muslim, the victory of [#allAh]{.trn2} is near."
