# Calling out to someone

## Introduction

When directly addressing soneone in Arabic and calling out to him by name, the particle [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} is usually prefixed to the person's name. For example,

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا زَيْنَبُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA zaynabu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O Zaynab."

There are different rules regarding the state markings of the noun following [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} and we will describe them in the following sections.

## Calling out to specific persons

### Using single word personal names

When a specific person is called out to, and the name used to call him consists of a single word, then that word shall be in the u-state. The sentence above is an example of this rule where the name [زَينَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} "Zaynab" is in the u-state.

If the word would have an [n]{.trn}-mark, then the [n]{.trn}-mark is dropped. So, for example, the name [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} "Zayd" usually has an [n]{.trn}-mark. But when used for being called out to, the [n]{.trn}-mark is dropped and it becomes:

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا زَيْدُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA zaydu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O Zayd."

### Using single word indefinite common nouns

The examples above show the person being called out to using a personal name. Instead of a personal name, a common noun can also be used with the same rule. Examples:

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا غُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA gulAmu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O you boy."

[ٱَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا جَارِيَةُ.]{.ar}  
[EassalAmu ealaykum yA jAriyatu.]{.trn}  
"Peace be upon you, O you girl."

In English, we have shown that a specific person is being called using the word "you", e.g., "O you boy". Duals and plurals are also allowed, again with the same rule:

[يَا رِجَالُ، قَدْ حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA rijAlu qad Hadava Eamrun.]{.trn}  
"O you men, a matter has occurred."

Note how the word [رِجَالُ]{.ar} [rijAlu]{.trn} "men" does not have an [n]{.trn}-mark because the word is used to call out to the specific persons.

Similarly,

[يَا لَاعِبَانِ بَدَأْتُمَا ٱللَّعِبَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُمَا ٱلْعَمَلَ.]{.ar}  
[yA lAeibAni badaEtuma -llaeiba wamA faealtuma -leamal.]{.trn}  
"O you players~2~, you have started playing and you have not done the work."

### Using single word definite common nouns

When using a common noun to call out to a person, especially if the common noun is a title, it is often desired to make the common noun definite with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. In this case, the particle [يَا]{.ar} [yA]{.trn} is modified to [أَيُّهَا]{.ar} [EayyuhA]{.trn}, or sometimes [يَاأَيُّهَا]{.ar} [yAEayyuhA]{.trn} if it is in the beginning of a sentence. Examples:

[يَاأَيُّهَا ٱلْأُسْتَاذُ، قَدْ فَعَلْتُ ٱلْوَاجِبَ.]{.ar}  
[yAEayyuha -lEustApu, qad faealtu -lwAjiba]{.trn}  
"O you the Professor, I have done the obligatory [work]."

[أَنَا سَقِيمٌ أَيُّهَا ٱلطَّبِيبُ.]{.ar}  
[Eana saqImun, Eayyuha -TTabIbu.]{.trn}  
"I am ill, O you the Doctor."

If the person being called out to is feminine, then [أَيُّهَا]{.ar} [EayyuhA]{.trn} is modified to [أَيَّتُهَا]{.ar} [EayyatuhA]{.trn}. For example:

[أَيَّتُهَا ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ، 


### Using multiple words

The above discussion pertains to calling out to the addressed person with a single word. Often times a person's name may consist of multiple words. For example:

+ [أَبُو بَكْرٍ]{.ar}  
  [EabU bakrin]{.trn}  
  "[#abU #bakr]{.trn2}"

+ [صَلَاحُ ٱلدِّينِ]{.ar}  
  [SalAHu -ddIni]{.trn}  
  "[#salAH ad-#dIn]{.trn2}"

In this case, then instead of the u-state, the word is put into the a-state. Furthermore, the [n]{.trn}-mark, if any, is preserved. Examples:

[يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ، أَنْتَ رَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA EabA bakrin, Eanta rajulun karImun]{.trn}  
"O [#abU #bakr]{.trn2}, You are a noble man."

[يَا صَلَاحَ ٱلدِّينِ، صَبَرْتَ فَنَصَرَكَ ٱللَّـٰهُ.]{.ar}  
[yA SalAHa -ddIni, Sabarta fanaSaraka -llAhu.]{.trn}  
"O [#salAH ad-#dIn]{.trn2}, you were patient so [#allAh]{.trn2} gave you victory."


If, instead of a personal name, a noun phrase consisting of multiple words is used to call out to a person, then in this case as well, the first noun shall be in the a-state. Examples:

[يَا ٱبْنَ أَخِي، قَدْ سَقَطَ قَلَمُكَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.]{.ar}  
[ya -bna EaxI, qad saqaTa qalamuka.]{.trn}  
"O my nephew, your pen has fallen on the ground."

[يَا تَلَامِيذَ ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ، ٱلْعِلْمُ أَمَانَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA talAmIpa -lmadrasati, -leilmu EamAnatun.]{.trn}  
"O pupils of the school, knowledge is a trust."

## Calling out to unspecified persons

All the discussion so far has pertained to calling out to specific persons. So for example, when you say,

<!--[يَا ظَالِمُ، عَذَابُ ٱللَّـٰهِ وَاقِعٌ.]{.ar}  -->
[يَا مُسْلِمُ، نَصْرُ ٱللَّـٰهِ قَرِيبٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA muslimu, naSru -llAhi qarIbun.]{.trn}  
"O you Muslim, the victory of [#allAh]{.trn2} is near."

then you are addressing a specific Muslim, who is perhaps in front of you. 

If an unspecified person or persons are being called out, then the word used to call out is put into the a-state. Furthermore, the [n]{.trn}-mark, if any, is preserved. So if you want to address any unspecific Muslim, you will say:

[يَا مُسْلِمًا، نَصْرُ ٱللَّـٰهِ قَرِيبٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA musliman, naSru -llAhi qarIbun.]{.trn}  
"O [any] Muslim, the victory of [#allAh]{.trn2} is near."

If multiple words are used, then whether or not the person called out to is specific, or unspecified, the first noun is put in the a-state.

[يَا لَاعِبِي لُعَبٍ، ٱلْوَقْتُ ثَمِينٌ.]{.ar}  
[yA lAeibI lueabini, -lwaqtu vamInun.]{.trn}  
"O [any] players of games, time is precious."
