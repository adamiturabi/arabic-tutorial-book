# Rules for writing [hamzao]{.trn} {#hamzarules}

[hamzao]{.trn} is written in four different ways:

1. Seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}: [أ]{.ar}
2. Seated on an [wAw]{.trn}: [ؤ]{.ar}
3. Seated on an [yAE]{.trn}: [ئ]{.ar}
4. Unseated: [ء]{.ar}

Here are some of notes about writing [hamzao]{.trn} in the above four methods:

+ When unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn}: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of [hamzao]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} is conventionally written as [آ]{.ar} as long as the [Ealif]{.trn} is not a suffix or part of a suffix. When the [Ealif]{.trn} is a suffix or part of a suffix then we will write [ءا]{.ar}, not [آ]{.ar}.

+ When unseated [hamzao]{.trn} comes between two letters that are joined, then it is written above the line that joins them, for example: [خَطِيـَٔةٌ]{.ar} [xaTIEatun]{.trn}. In this word, the [yAE]{.trn} [ي]{.ar} joins to the looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. So the unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is written above the joining line like so [ــٔـ]{.ar}.

+ When [hamzao]{.trn} is seated on [Ealif]{.trn}, if it has an [i]{.trn}-mark, it is written below the [Ealif]{.trn}: [إِ]{.ar}. Otherwise, it is written above the [Ealif]{.trn}: [أَ]{.ar}, [أُ]{.ar}, [أْ]{.ar}.

+ When [hamzao]{.trn} is seated on [yAE]{.trn} [ئ]{.ar} the dots of the [yAE]{.trn} are no longer written. Here's how it will appear in different positions:

  Isolated | End | Middle | Beginnning
  :--------|:----|:-------|:----------
  [ئ]{.ar}| [ـئ]{.ar}| [ـئـ]{.ar}| [ئـ]{.ar}


So how do we know when to write [hamzao]{.trn} unseated and when seated? And how do we choose between its three different seats? There are a set of rules that we need to follow in order to correctly write [hamzao]{.trn}. These rules are quite complicated (although they have a basic underlying strategy in them). We will give the complete set of rules here. But for now, you may limit yourself to understanding the rules for [hamzao]{.trn} in the beginning of a word. The remaining rules are here for you to refer back to as you come across words with [hamzao]{.trn}.

1. If [hamzao]{.trn} occurs in the beginning of a word:
   a. If the [hamzao]{.trn} carries a long-[A]{.trn} vowel, it is written unseated followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} and written as [آ]{.ar}, for example [آمَنَ]{.ar} [EAmana]{.trn}.
   b. If the [hamzao]{.trn} carries any other vowel, it is written seated on an [Ealif]{.trn}, and is marked with the appropriated vowel mark, for example [أَسْلَمَ]{.ar} [Easlama]{.trn}, [أُرِيدُ]{.ar} [EurIdu]{.trn}, [إِسْلَامُ]{.ar} [EislAmu]{.trn}, [إِيمَانُ]{.ar} [EImAnu]{.trn}, [أُوخِذَ]{.ar} [EUxipa]{.trn}. 

2. If [hamzao]{.trn} occurs in the middle of a word:
   a. If there is a long vowel or semi-vowel before the [hamzao]{.trn}:
      i. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long-[I]{.trn} vowel or [ay]{.trn} semi-vowel, then the hamzao will be written unseated. Examples:  
      [هَيْـَٔةُ]{.ar} [hayEatu]{.trn}, [خَطِيـَٔةُ]{.ar} [xaTIEatu]{.trn}  
      [مُسِيـُٔونَ]{.ar} [musIEUna]{.trn}, [مُسِيـَٔانِ]{.ar} [musIEAni]{.trn}, [مُسِيـِٔينَ]{.ar} [musIEIna]{.trn}, [مُسِيـَٔيْنِ]{.ar} [musIEayni]{.trn}  
      [شَيْـُٔهُ]{.ar} [cayEuhu]{.trn}, [شَيْـَٔهُ]{.ar} [cayEahu]{.trn}, [شَيْـِٔهِ]{.ar} [cayEihi]{.trn}, [شَيْـَٔانِ]{.ar} [cayEAni]{.trn}, [شَيْـَٔيْنِ]{.ar} [cayEayni]{.trn}  
      [مَجِيـُٔهُ]{.ar} [majIEuhu]{.trn}, [مَجِيـَٔهُ]{.ar} [majIEahu]{.trn}, [مَجِيـِٔهِ]{.ar} [majIEihi]{.trn}  
      ii. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long-[U]{.trn} vowel or [aw]{.trn} semi-vowel, then:  
          If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [i]{.trn}-mark it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Examples:
          [سُوئِهِ]{.ar} [sUEihi]{.trn}, [ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar} [DawEihi]{.trn}  
          Otherwise, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written unseated. Examples:
          [سُوءَه]{.ar} [sUEahu]{.trn}, [سُوءَانِ]{.ar} [sUEAni]{.trn},  [تَوْءَمُ]{.ar} [tawEamu]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَهُ]{.ar} [DawEahu]{.trn},  [ضَوْءَانِ]{.ar} [DawEAni]{.trn},  [سُوءُهُ]{.ar} [sUEuhu]{.trn},  [يَسُوءُونَ]{.ar} [yasUEUna]{.trn}  
      iii. If the [hamzao]{.trn} is after a long [A]{.trn}-vowel, then:
           If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [i]{.trn}-mark it is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example:
           [سَائِلُ]{.ar} [sAEilu]{.trn}.  
           If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [u]{.trn}-mark it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example: [تَسَاؤُلُ]{.ar} [tasAEulu]{.trn}.  
           Otherwise, when the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [a]{.trn}-mark, it is written unseated. Example: [سَاءَلَ]{.ar} [sAEala]{.trn}, [قِرَاءَاتُ]{.ar} [qirAEAtu]{.trn}.
   b. If the letter before the [hamzao]{.trn} has a $\emptyset$-mark and is not [wAw]{.trn} or [yAE]{.trn}, then:
      i. If the [hamzao]{.trn} was originally at the end of the word, but a suffix has been attached to the word, then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written unseated. Examples: [عِبْـَٔانِ]{.ar} [eibEAni]{.trn}, [عِبْـَٔييْنِ]{.ar} [eibEayni]{.trn}, [بُطْـَٔهُ]{.ar} [buTEahu]{.trn}, [بُطْـُٔهُ]{.ar} [buTEuhu]{.trn}, [بُطْـِٔهِ]{.ar} [buTEihi]{.trn}. ([انِ]{.ar}, [يْنِ]{.ar}, [هُ]{.ar}, and [هِ]{.ar} are suffixes).
      ii. Otherwise, if the [hamzao]{.trn} is originally at the middle of the word, then it is written seated on [wAw]{.trn} if it has an [u]{.trn}-mark and [yAE]{.trn} if it has an [i]{.trn}-mark. Examples: [مَسْؤُولُ]{.ar} [masEUlu]{.trn}, [تَرْئِيسُ]{.ar} [tarEIsu]{.trn}.  
          If the [hamzao]{.trn} has an [a]{.trn} mark then:  
          If it is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is unseated followed by the [Ealif]{.trn} and the combination is written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [مِرْآةُ]{.ar} [mirEAtu]{.trn}, [ظَمْآنُ]{.ar} [PamEAnu]{.trn}.  
          Otherwise, if there is no [Ealif]{.trn} after the [hamzao]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [مَسْأَلَةُ]{.ar} [masEalatu]{.trn}, , [مَرْأَةُ]{.ar} [marEatu]{.trn}.
   c. If the [hamzao]{.trn} has a $\emptyset$-mark, then it is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn} if it has an [a]{.trn}-mark, [wAw]{.trn} if it has an [u]{.trn}-mark, and [yAE]{.trn} if it has an [i]{.trn}-mark. Examples: [كَأْسُ]{.ar} [kaEsu]{.trn}, [بِئْسَ]{.ar} [biEsa]{.trn}, [سُؤْلَكَ]{.ar} [suElaka]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, only if the above conditions are not satisfied, then compare the vowel marks of the [hamzao]{.trn} and the letter before it:
      i. If either vowel mark is an [i]{.trn}-mark then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on a [yAE]{.trn}. Examples: [سُئِلَ]{.ar} [suEila]{.trn}, [يَئِسَ]{.ar} [yaEisa]{.trn}, [مُتَّكِئِينَ]{.ar} [muttakiEIna]{.trn}.
      ii. If neither vowel mark is an [i]{.trn}-mark, and at least one of the vowel marks is a [u]{.trn}-mark, then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on a [wAw]{.trn}. Examples: [سُؤَالُ]{.ar} [suEAlu]{.trn}, [رُؤُوسُ]{.ar} [ruEUsu]{.trn}, [لُؤَيُّ]{.ar} [luEayyu]{.trn}.
      iii. Otherwise, if both of the vowel marks are [a]{.trn}-marks, then:  
           If the [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by a long-[A]{.trn} vowel represented by an [Ealif]{.trn}, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written unseated. Examples: [شَنَآنُ]{.ar} [canaEAnu]{.trn}.  
           Otherwise the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written on an [Ealif]{.trn}. Examples: [سَأَلَ]{.ar} [saEala]{.trn}, [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} [raEA]{.trn}.

      These set of rules apply even if the [hamzao]{.trn} or the previous letter is doubled. Examples [رَأَّسَ]{.ar} [raEEasa]{.trn} [يُرَئِّسُ]{.ar} [yuraEEisu]{.trn} [رُئِّسَ]{.ar} [ruEEisa]{.trn} [تَفَؤُّلُ]{.ar} [tafaEEulu]{.trn} [يُبَرِّئُونَ]{.ar} [yubarriEUna]{.trn} [يُبَرَّؤُونَ]{.ar} [yubarraEUna]{.trn}.

3. If [hamzao]{.trn} is at the end of a word, disregard the vowel mark on it and consider only the letter before the [hamzao]{.trn}.
   a. If there is a long vowel ([A]{.trn}, [I]{.trn}, [U]{.trn}) or a semi-vowel ([aw]{.trn}, [ay]{.trn}) before it then the [hamzao]{.trn} will be written unseated. Examples: [دُعَاءُ]{.ar} [dueAEu]{.trn}, [سُوءُ]{.ar} [sUEu]{.trn}, [جِيءَ]{.ar} [jIEa]{.trn}, [ضَوْءَ]{.ar} [DawEa]{.trn}, [شَيْءَ]{.ar} [cayEa]{.trn}.
   b. Otherwise, if the previous letter has a $\emptyset$-mark, the [hamzao]{.trn} will again be unseated. Examples: [بُطْءُ]{.ar} [buTEu]{.trn}, [عِبْءُ]{.ar} [eibEu]{.trn}, [شَطْءُ]{.ar} [caTEu]{.trn}
   c. Otherwise, if the previous letter is a doubled [wAw]{.trn} with an [u]{.trn}-mark, the [hamzao]{.trn} will again be unseated. Example [تَبَوُّءُ]{.ar} [tabawwuEu]{.trn}.
   d. Otherwise, if the previous letter has an:
      i. [a]{.trn}-mark, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [Ealif]{.trn}. Example [يَهْدَأُ]{.ar} [yahdaEu]{.trn}, [مُبْتَدَإِ]{.ar} [mubtadaEi]{.trn}.
      ii. [i]{.trn}-mark, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [yAE]{.trn}. Example [يُهَدِّئُ]{.ar} [yuhaddiEu]{.trn}, [سَيِّئُ]{.ar} [sayyiEu]{.trn}.
      iii. [u]{.trn}-mark, the [hamzao]{.trn} is written seated on [wAw]{.trn}. Example [بَطُؤَ]{.ar} [baTuEa]{.trn}.
     
Some further notes:

+ If [hamzao]{.trn} is in the beginning of a word, adding a prefix to the word will not alter the writing of the [hamzao]{.trn}. Examples: [لِ + أُسْتَاذِ = لِأُسْتَاذِ]{.ar}.

+ If [hamzao]{.trn} is at the end of a word, adding a suffix to the word can, in general, alter the writing of the [hamzao]{.trn}, except in cases that have already been mentioned above. Examples:  
  [مُبْتَدَأَ + انِ = مُبْتَدَءَانِ]{.ar}  
  [دُعَاءُ + هُ = دُعَاؤُهُ]{.ar}  
  [ضَوْءِ + هِ = ضَوْئِهِ]{.ar}  
  [بُطْءُ + هُ = بُطْـُٔهُ]{.ar}

+ As we mentioned earlier, when unseated [hamzao]{.trn} is followed by an [Ealif]{.trn} which is not a suffix: [ءا]{.ar},  the combination of [hamzao]{.trn} and [Ealif]{.trn} is conventionally written as [آ]{.ar}. However, if the unseated hamzao is doubled and then followed by an [alif]{.trn}: [ءَّا]{.ar} then it won't be written as [آ]{.ar}. Example: [سَـَّٔالُ]{.ar} [saEEAlu]{.trn}.
