# $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verbs

## Introduction

In 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs)
we mentioned that incomplete action verbs have three states (like nouns). 
These states are called:

i. The u-state
i. The a-state
i. The $\emptyset$-state

We have already studied the u-state of incomplete-action verbs in 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs).
And we will defer the study of 
a-state of incomplete-action verbs to
chapter\ \@ref(a-state-incomplete-action-verbs).
In this chapter we will study the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

We will also study the _verb of command_ which is very similar to the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

## Forming the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

Here is the u-state incomplete action verb for the singular masculine absentee participant doer "he":

[يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}  
[yafealu]{.trn}  
"he does"

Note that, because it is in the u-state, the its final letter ends with a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}.
In order to form the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb,
we change the [u]{.trn}-mark into a
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar}, thus:

[يَفْعَلْ]{.ar}  
[yafeal]{.trn}  

This is done for all participants whose doer pronoun is invisible and u-state verb ends with a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}.

For participants whose doer pronoun is followed by an extra [ن]{.ar} in the u-state verb, this final [ن]{.ar} is dropped in order to form the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.
So, for example, the u-state
incomplete-action verb:

[يَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  
[yafealAni]{.trn}  
"they~2,m~ do"

becomes, for the 
$\emptyset$-state:

[يَفْعَلَا]{.ar}  
[yafealA]{.trn}  

Here is the complete table of the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
for all doer participants.

|Participant|Incomplete-action verb doer pronoun|u-state incomplete-action verb | $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb
|:---|:--|:---|:---|
| he          |_invisible_         |[يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[يَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| she         |_invisible_         |[تَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| you~1,m~    |_invisible_         |[تَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| you~1,f~    |[ي]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلِينَ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلِي]{.ar}   |
| I           |_invisible_         |[أَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[أَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| they~2,m~   |[ا]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[يَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| they~2,f~   |[ا]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| you~2~      |[ا]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| they~3+,m~  |[و]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلُونَ]{.ar}  |[يَفْعَلُوا]{.ar}  |
| they~3+,f~  |[نَ]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar}   |[يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (same)   |
| you~3+,m~   |[و]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلُونَ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلُوا]{.ar}  |
| you~3+,f~   |[نَ]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar}   |[تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (same)  |
| we          |_invisible_         |[نَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[نَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |

Take note the following:

+ The u-state and $\emptyset$-state verbs are the same for the feminine plural absentee and addressee participants: 
  + [يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (they~3+,f~)
  + [تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (you~3+,f~)
+ The u-state and $\emptyset$-state verbs for the masculine plural absentee and addressee participants have a final silent [Ealif]{.trn}: 
  + [يَفْعَلُوا]{.ar} (they~3+,m~) 
  + [تَفْعَلُوا]{.ar} (you~3+,m~)
+ When the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
ends with a 
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar}, and the next word begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} [ٱ]{.ar} then the
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar} is converted to an [i]{.trn} mark [◌ِ]{.ar}. For example:
  + [يَفْعَلْ + ٱلرَّجُلُ = يَفْعَلِ ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}

## Uses of the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

The u-state is the default state for incomplete-action verbs. The 
$\emptyset$-state
is used only in specific cases. We will explain these below.

### With [لِ]{.ar} for indirect commands

The particle [لِ]{.ar} when connected to the front of a 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
gives the meaning of an indirect command. In English this can be translated using "should" or "let":

[لِيَذْهَبِ ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}  
"The man should go!"  
or  
"Let the man go!"  
("Let" is being used here as a command for the man, not for the addressee of this speech.)

The particles [فَ]{.ar} "so" and [وَ]{.ar} "and" are frequently used before this [لِ]{.ar}. 
The [لِ]{.ar} then loses its [i]{.trn}-mark and gets a
$\emptyset$-mark. Examples:

[فَلْنَأْكُلْ طَعَامَنَا وَلْنَشْرَبْ شَرَابَنَا.]{.ar}  
"So let us eat our food and drink our drink!"

[لِتَجْلِسُوا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.]{.ar}  
"You should sit on the ground!"



### With [لَا]{.ar} for prohibitions



### With [لَمْ]{.ar} for "did not"



### Other uses of the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

The $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb is also used for _consequential actions_ and in _conditional statements_. We will deal with these in
chapters\ \@ref(the-consequential-action)
and\ \@ref(conditional-statements)
respectively
