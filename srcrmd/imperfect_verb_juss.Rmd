# $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verbs

## Introduction

In 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs)
we mentioned that incomplete action verbs have three states (like nouns). 
These states are called:

i. The u-state
i. The a-state
i. The $\emptyset$-state

We have already studied the u-state of incomplete-action verbs in 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs).
In this chapter we will study the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

We will also study the _verb of command_ which is very similar to the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

## Pattern of the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb.
