# $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verbs

## Introduction

In 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs)
we mentioned that incomplete action verbs have three states (like nouns). 
These states are called:

i. The u-state
i. The a-state
i. The $\emptyset$-state

We have already studied the u-state of incomplete-action verbs in 
chapter\ \@ref(u-state-incomplete-action-verbs).
And we will defer the study of 
a-state of incomplete-action verbs to
chapter\ \@ref(a-state-incomplete-action-verbs).
In this chapter we will study the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

We will also study the _verb of command_ which is very similar to the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.

## Forming the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

Here is the u-state incomplete action verb for the singular masculine absentee participant doer "he":

[يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}  
[yafealu]{.trn}  
"he does"

Note that, because it is in the u-state, the its final letter ends with a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}.
In order to form the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb,
we change the [u]{.trn}-mark into a
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar}, thus:

[يَفْعَلْ]{.ar}  
[yafeal]{.trn}  

This is done for all participants whose doer pronoun is invisible and u-state verb ends with a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar}.

For participants whose doer pronoun is followed by an extra [ن]{.ar} in the u-state verb, this final [ن]{.ar} is dropped in order to form the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.
So, for example, the u-state
incomplete-action verb:

[يَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  
[yafealAni]{.trn}  
"they~2,m~ do"

becomes, for the 
$\emptyset$-state:

[يَفْعَلَا]{.ar}  
[yafealA]{.trn}  

Here is the complete table of the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
for all doer participants.

|Participant|Incomplete-action verb doer pronoun|u-state incomplete-action verb | $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb|
|:---|:--|:---|:---|
| he          |_invisible_         |[يَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[يَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| she         |_invisible_         |[تَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| you~1,m~    |_invisible_         |[تَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[تَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| you~1,f~    |[ي]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلِينَ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلِي]{.ar}   |
| I           |_invisible_         |[أَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[أَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| they~2,m~   |[ا]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[يَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| they~2,f~   |[ا]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| you~2~      |[ا]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلَانِ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| they~3+,m~  |[و]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلُونَ]{.ar}  |[يَفْعَلُوا]{.ar}  |
| they~3+,f~  |[نَ]{.ar}            |[يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar}   |[يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (same)   |
| you~3+,m~   |[و]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلُونَ]{.ar}  |[تَفْعَلُوا]{.ar}  |
| you~3+,f~   |[نَ]{.ar}            |[تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar}   |[تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (same)  |
| we          |_invisible_         |[نَفْعَلُ]{.ar}    |[نَفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |

Take note the following:

+ The u-state and $\emptyset$-state verbs are the same for the feminine plural absentee and addressee participants: 
  + [يَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (they~3+,f~)
  + [تَفْعَلْنَ]{.ar} (you~3+,f~)
+ The u-state and $\emptyset$-state verbs for the masculine plural absentee and addressee participants have a final silent [Ealif]{.trn}: 
  + [يَفْعَلُوا]{.ar} (they~3+,m~) 
  + [تَفْعَلُوا]{.ar} (you~3+,m~)
+ When the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
ends with a 
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar}, and the next word begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} [ٱ]{.ar} then the
$\emptyset$-mark [◌ْ]{.ar} is converted to an [i]{.trn} mark [◌ِ]{.ar}. For example:
  + [يَفْعَلْ + ٱلرَّجُلُ = يَفْعَلِ ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}

## Uses of the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

The u-state is the default state for incomplete-action verbs. The 
$\emptyset$-state
is used only in specific cases. We will explain these below.

### With [لِ]{.ar} for indirect commands

The particle [لِ]{.ar} when connected to the front of a 
incomplete-action verb
causes it to be in the
$\emptyset$-state
and gives it the meaning of an indirect command. In English this can be translated using "should" or "let":

[لِيَذْهَبِ ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}  
"The man should go!"  
or  
"Let the man go!"  
("Let" is being used here as a command for the man, not for the addressee of this speech.)

The particles [فَ]{.ar} "so" and [وَ]{.ar} "and" are frequently used before this [لِ]{.ar}. 
The [لِ]{.ar} then loses its [i]{.trn}-mark and gets a
$\emptyset$-mark. Examples:

[فَلْنَأْكُلْ طَعَامَنَا وَلْنَشْرَبْ شَرَابَنَا.]{.ar}  
"So let us eat our food and drink our drink!"

[لِتَجْلِسُوا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ.]{.ar}  
"You should sit on the ground!"

### With [لَا]{.ar} for prohibitions {#la-of-prohibition}

The word [لَا]{.ar} when in front of a 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
gives the meaning of a prohibition. 
In English this can be translated using "Don't".

For example,

[لَا تَكْتُبُوا]{.ar}  
"Don't write~3,m~!"

[يَا زَيْدُ، لَا تَدْخُلِ ٱلْبَيْتَ!]{.ar}  
"Don't~1,m~ enter the house!"

The particles [فَ]{.ar} "so" and [وَ]{.ar} "and" may be used before this [لَا]{.ar}. 
Example:

[فَلَا تَأْكُلْ وَلَا تَشْرَبْ!]{.ar}  
"So don't eat~1,m~ and don't drink~1,m~!"

Such prohibitions are generally for the addressee participant. 
However, rarely, they may be issued for the absentee participant as well. Example:

[لَايَمْنَعْ زَيْدًا ٱلدُّخُولَ.]{.ar}  
"Let him not prevent Zayd from entering!"

<!-- Example from Quran:
[لَا تُسْرِفْ فِي ٱلْقَتْلِ]{.ar}

http://www.alfaseeh.com/vb/showthread.php?t=72471&p=558734&viewfull=1#post558734
-->

By the way, [لَا]{.ar} does not force a verb to be in the u-state
$\emptyset$-state. We have already seen in 
section\ \@ref(u-state-verb-negation-la)
that [لَا]{.ar} can be used to negate a u-state incomplete-action verb for the present and future tense.
Example:

[لَا يَذْهَبُ ٱلرَّجُلُ]{.ar}  
[lA yaphabu -rrajulu.]{.trn}  
"The man does not go." or,  
"The man is not going." or,  
"The man will not go."

### With [لَمْ]{.ar} for "did not"

The particle [لَمْ]{.ar} when in front of an
incomplete-action verb
causes it to be in the
$\emptyset$-state
and gives it the meaning of
negating the past tense
In English this can be translated using "did not".
For example,

[لَمْ يَذْهَبِ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
"The man did not go."

We have already learned in 
section\ \@ref(negating-completed-action-verbs) that the completed-action verb is negated using the particle [مَا]{.ar}. For example:

[مَا ذَهَبَ ٱلرَّجُلُ.]{.ar}  
[mA pahaba -rrajulu.]{.trn}  
"The man did not go."  
or,  
"The man has not gone."

Both [لَمْ]{.ar} and [مَا]{.ar} are used commonly to negate the past tense.
[مَا]{.ar} has a more emphatic meaning than [لَمْ]{.ar}.

Here are some more examples:

### With [لَمَّا]{.ar} for "did not yet"

The word [لَمَّا]{.ar} when in front of a 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb
gives the meaning "did not yet". 
For example,

[لَمَّا يَذْهَبْ زَيْدٌ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd did not go yet."

### Other uses of the $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb

The $\emptyset$-state incomplete-action verb is also used for _consequential actions_ and in _conditional statements_. We will deal with these in
chapters\ \@ref(the-consequential-action)
and\ \@ref(conditional-statements)
respectively

## The verb of command

In order to give a direct command to an addressee, Arabic uses the verb of command. The verb of command is very similar to the 
$\emptyset$-state
incomplete-action verb.
The verb of command is only available for the addressee participant. 

### Forming the verb of command

Here is the verb of command for the addressee participants:

|Participant| Verb of command|
|:---|:---|
| you~1,m~    |[ٱفْعَلْ]{.ar}    |
| you~1,f~    |[ٱفْعَلِي]{.ar}   |
| you~2~      |[ٱفْعَلَا]{.ar}   |
| you~3+,m~   |[ٱفْعَلُوا]{.ar}  |
| you~3+,f~   |[ٱفْعَلْنَ]{.ar}   |

In order to form the verb of command, we remove the initial [ت]{.ar} from the addressee particpant verb. The verb then begins with an $\emptyset$-mark so we place a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} in front of it.

When the verb of command occurs in the beginning of a sentence, then the vowel mark for the connecting [hamzah]{.trn} is selected according to the following criteria:

i. When the middle root letter of the verb of command has an [u]{.trn}-mark\ [◌ُ]{.ar}, then the connecting [hamzah]{.trn} gets an [u]{.trn}-mark\ too. Examples:

   | Verb | Verb of command for "he" |
   |:------|:-----|
   |[نَظَرَ يَنْظُرُ نَظَرًا]{.ar}  | [ٱُنْظُرْ]{.ar} "Look!"|
   |[قَتَلَ يَقْتُلُ قَتْلًا]{.ar}  | [ٱُقْتُلْ]{.ar} "Kill!"|
   |[مَكَثَ يَمْكُثُ مُكُوثًا]{.ar} | [ٱُمْكُثْ]{.ar} "Stay!"|

i. Otherwise, when the middle root letter of the verb of command has an [a]{.trn}-mark\ [◌َ]{.ar} or an [i]{.trn}-mark\ [◌ِ]{.ar}, then the connecting [hamzah]{.trn} gets an [i]{.trn}-mark\ [◌ِ]{.ar}. Examples:

   | Verb | Verb of command for "he" |
   |:------|:-----|
   |[عَمِلَ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا]{.ar}  | [ٱِعْمَلْ]{.ar} "Work!"|
   |[ذَهَبَ يَذْهَبُ ذَهَابًا]{.ar} | [ٱِذْهَبْ]{.ar} "Go!"  |
   |[جَلَسَ يَجْلِسُ جُلُوسًا]{.ar} | [ٱِجْلِسْ]{.ar} "Sit!" |

### Usage of the verb of command

Here are some examples of using the verb of command:


The verb of command is not used to issue negative commands, like "Don't go!". 
Instead, the 
$\emptyset$-state verb is used with [لَا]{.ar}
as described in
section\ \@ref(la-of-prohibition)
above.

[لَا تَذْهَبْ]{.ar}  
"Don't go!"
