# Adjectival nouns

## Introduction

So far we have studied common nouns like [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" and  [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house". 
<!--These are called designative nouns because the noun designates a specific object or entity.-->

In this chapter we will study *adjectival-nouns*. Adjectival-nouns are a class of nouns that don't denote objects. Rather they describe some quality of an object.

## Adjectives in English

In English we usually use adjectives to describe nouns. For example, the word "big" is an adjective. It can be used to describe a noun in a noun-phrase. For example:

"a big car"

And it can be used as the information of a sentence, also describing a noun. For example:

"The car is big."

But it can't be used by itself as a noun. So we can't say, for example:

$\times$ "The big is fast."

We would have to say something like:

"The big car is fast."

## Adjectival-nouns in English

Consider the English word "antique". It is what we will call a _adjectival-noun_. 
<!--It describes some quality of the object it refers to.-->

It can be used just like an adjective to describe a noun as part of a noun-phrase. For example:

"The antique table is expensive."

In the above sentence the adjective "antique" is describing the noun "table".

It can also be used as the information of a sentence, just like an adjective. For example:

"The table is antique."

But what makes it different from an normal adjective is that it can also be used by itself as a noun. For example:

"The antique is expensive."

Here "the antique" could refer to any entity that can be described by the quality of being old and valuable. The adjectival-noun does not require any other noun in this sentence and can stand on its own.

Adjectival-nouns are rare in English. Adjectives are usually used when we want to describe a noun.

## Adjectival-nouns in Arabic

<!--In Arabic, however, the situation is reversed. -->
Arabic does not have adjectives. It only has adjectival-nouns.

For example, [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is a adjectival-noun which describes the quality of being small or little. Because it is a noun, and not an adjective, it technically means "a little one" or "a small one", where "one" can refer to any entity, e.g., a person, an animal, an object, etc, that is small or little. But this translation "a little/small one" may be a little awkward in English in some sentences, so we will often translate it  in English with the adjective "little" or "small".

Notice that [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} has an [n]{.trn}-mark. This means it is indefinite and it is why we translated it as "_a_ little one". Instead of an [n]{.trn}-mark, it can be preceded by [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in order to give [ٱَلصَغِيرُ]{.ar} [aSSagIru]{.trn}  in which case it will be definite and mean "_the_ little/small one".

We can use this adjectival-noun as a noun in a sentence. For example:

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lEummu -SSagIra.]{.trn}  
"The mother carried the little one."

Here we may infer that "the little one" refers to a child.

In addition to having the indefnite and definite property of nouns, adjectival-nouns also have gender: they may be masculine or feminine. 

The masculine [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is used when the noun described by the adjectival-noun is masculine, like [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house".

The feminine of most adjectival-nouns is formed by adding the feminine marker [ة]{.ar}. Some adjectival-nouns take other feminine markers, as we will see in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

So in order to form the feminine of [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn}, we add [ة]{.ar} to it and it becomes [صَغِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [SagIratun]{.trn}.
The feminine [صَغِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [SagIratun]{.trn} is used when the noun described by the adjectival-noun is feminine, like [شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} "a tree".

##  Describers in a noun-phrase

### A adjectival-noun as the describer

The expression "a small house" is an example of a noun-phrase. It consists of a _describer_ and a _describee_. The adjective "small" is the describer and the noun "a house" is the describee.

In an English noun-phrase, the describer comes before the describee.

In an Arabic noun-phrase, a adjectival-noun is used as the describer to give the meaning of the adjective. The describee comes first and the describer comes after the describee. Furthermore, the describer matches the describee in state, definiteness, and gender.

So in Arabic, in order to express "a small house", we put the [describee]{.syn} [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house" first, and place the adjectival-noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} "a small one" after it as the [describer]{.syn}. Then the adjectival-noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} gives the meaning of the adjective "small":

[بَيْتٌ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[baytun SagIrun]{.trn}  
"a house, a small one" = "a small house"

Here the [describee]{.syn} [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house" is masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. Therefore, the [describer]{.syn} [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} "a small one" is also is also masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. 
Similarly, for "the small tree" we say:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[accajaratu -SSagIratu]{.trn}  
"the tree, the big one" = "the small tree"

Here too the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ]{.ar} [aSSagIratu]{.trn} "the small one" matches the [describee]{.syn} [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" in being feminine, definite, and in the u-state.

Here are examples of noun-phrases with adjectival-nouns used in sentences:

[ذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ صَغِيرٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba EilA baytin SagIrin.]{.trn}  
"He went to a small house."

[ٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[EaljAriyatu -SSagIratu fi -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"The little girl is at school."

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْغُلَامَ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lmarEatu -lgulAma -SSagIra.]{.trn}  
"The woman carried the little boy."

### Multiple describers

If there are multiple describers to be used in a noun phrases, they may follow one another sequentially, with, or without the word [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} "and", just as in English. For example, the adjectival-noun [جَمِيلٌ]{.ar} [jamIlun]{.trn} means "a beautiful one". We can combine it with [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} "a small one" thus:

[لِلرَّجُلِ بَيْتٌ جَمِيلٌ صَغِيرٌ.]{.ar}  
[lirrajuli baytun jamIlun SagIrun.]{.trn}  
"The man has a beautiful small house."

[لِلرَّجُلِ بَيْتٌ صَغِيرٌ وَجَمِيلٌ.]{.ar}  
[lirrajuli baytun SagIrun wajamIlun.]{.trn}  
"The man has a small and beautiful house."

### A prepositional phrase as the describer

Consider the phrase:

[كِتَابٌ مِنَ ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ]{.ar}  
[kitAbun mina -lmaktabati]{.trn}  
"a book from the library"

The prepositional phrase [مِنَ ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ]{.ar} [mina -lmaktabati]{.trn} "from the library" is not a adjectival-noun. Yet it still acts as a describer for the noun [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn} "a book", in that it is describing a quality of the book.

If we want to add a adjectival-noun as an additional describer, we may add it either before or after the prepositional phrase describer. Here are both examples as complete sentences:

[قَرَأَ كِتَابًا صَغِيرًا مِنَ ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ.]{.ar}  
[qaraEa kitAban SagIran mina -lmaktabati.]{.trn}  
AND  
[قَرَأَ كِتَابًا مِنَ ٱلْمَكْتَبَةِ صَغِيرًا.]{.ar}  
[qaraEa kitAban mina -lmaktabati SagIran.]{.trn}  
"a small book from the library"

The first option is usually chosen as a matter of preference but the second option is legitimate too.

## Adjectival-nouns as the information in a sentence

### Indefinite adjectival-nouns as the [information]{.syn}

We have just studied [بَيْتٌ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [baytun SagIrun]{.trn} "a small man" as an example of a noun-phrase. Now let's take a look at the sentence:

"The house is small."

This is a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. The noun "the house" is the [subject]{.syn} and the adjective "small" is the [information]{.syn}.

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we again remember that Arabic does not have adjectives and uses adjectival-nouns instead. When an indefinite adjectival-noun is used as the [information]{.syn} of a sentence, it gives the meaning of the adjective. So in order to express this sentence in Arabic, we will say:

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu SagIrun]{.trn}  
"The house is a small one." = "The house is small."

The indefinite adjectival-noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is the [information]{.syn} of the sentence. Therefore, it gives the meaning of the adjective "small".

### Definite adjectival-nouns as the [information]{.syn}

We can also use a definite adjectival-noun as the [information]{.syn} too.

[ٱلْبَيْتُ ٱلصًّغِيرُ هُوَ ٱلْجَمِيلُ.]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu -SSagIru huwa -ljamIlu.]{.trn}  
"The small house is the beautiful one."

[ٱَلْجَمِيلُ]{.ar} [EaljamIlu]{.trn} is the definite adjectival-noun in the information of the sentence. Here it won't be translated as the adjective "beautiful". Instead it will be translated as a noun "the beautiful one".
