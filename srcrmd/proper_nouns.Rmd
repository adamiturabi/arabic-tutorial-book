# Proper nouns

| Place |names | Misc. |names |
|-:|:--|-:|:---|
|[مَكَّة^2^]{.ar}   |Mecca     |[رَمَضَان^2^]{.ar} |[#ramadAn^2^]{.trn2} (month) |

Note the following points from the list abobe:

+ Although some names begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, most don't.
+ Many names are semi-flexible (indicated by ◌^2^).
+ Some names consist of more than a single word, like [عَبْد ٱللَّـٰه]{.ar}    [e#abd #allAh]{.trn2}

Proper nouns are names of persons and places. Proper nouns are always definite. Despite being definite, they will often not begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}.

## Male names

Here are some examples of male names: 

+ [مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar} [muHammadun]{.trn} [#muHammad]{.trn2}
+ [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} [#zayd]{.trn2}
+ [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} [#saeId]{.trn2}
+ [عَلِيٌّ]{.ar} [ealiyyun]{.trn} [e#alI]{.trn2}
+ [سَعْدٌ]{.ar} [saedun]{.trn} [#saed]{.trn2}
+ [ٱَلْحَسَنُ]{.ar} [Ealhasanu]{.trn} [#al-#Hasan]{.trn2}
+ [أَسْعَدُ]{.ar} [Easeadu]{.trn} [E#asead]{.trn2}
+ [عُثْمَانُ]{.ar} [euvmAnu]{.trn} [e#uvmAn]{.trn2}
+ [طَلْحَةُ]{.ar} [Talhatu]{.trn} [#Talhah]{.trn2}
+ [إِبْرَاهِيمُ]{.ar} [EibrAhImu]{.trn} [E#ibrAhIm]{.trn2}
+ [عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn} [e#umar]{.trn2}

You can see that male names often have an [n]{.trn}-mark. This does not mean that they are indefinite. Rather, as we've mentioned above, proper noun are always definite. So, for example, it is possible for a proper noun with an [n]{.trn}-mark to begin a subject-information sentence, because it is definite:

[مُحَمَّدٌ رَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
[muHammadun rajulun karImun.]{.trn}  
"[#muHammad]{.trn2} is a noble man."

<!-- [جَاءَ مُجَمَّدٌ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
  [jAEa muHammaduni -lkabIru.]{.trn}  
  "The noble [#muHammad]{.trn2} came."

FIXME: Isn't this a badal instead? Maybe remove this section. -->

Names are also often originally qualitative nouns with a good meaning. For example, [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} is a qualitative noun meaning "happy".

Sometimes, it is not clear from the sentence itself whether a word is used as a qualitative noun, or as a name. For example:

[جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa saeIdun]{.trn}  
"A happy (masc.) one came."  
OR  
"[#saeId]{.trn2} came."

Many male names are fully changing but there are some that are non-fully-changing. A male name will be non-fully-changing if it falls under the following categories:

1. The male name ends with an [ان]{.ar} which is external to the word's root. This is regardless of whether or not the word was originally a qualitative noun. A name that falls under this category is [عُثْمَانُ]{.ar} [euvmAnu]{.trn} [e#uvmAn]{.trn2} of the root [عثم]{.arroot}.
2. The male name is on the pattern [أَفْعَل]{.ar}, e.g. [أَسْعَدُ]{.ar} [Easeadu]{.trn} [E#asead]{.trn2} of the root [سعد]{.arroot}.
3. The male name ends with a [ة]{.ar}. We have learned that [ة]{.ar} is a feminine marker for singular nouns. However, it is often found in male names and in this case it is not a feminine marker. When a male name ends with [ة]{.ar} then it will be non-fully-changing. An example of a male name that ends with [ة]{.ar} is [طَلْحَةُ]{.ar} [Talhatu]{.trn} [#Talhah]{.trn2}.
4. The male name is non-Arabic in origin, and comprises of more than three letters. Most of the earlier prophets' names that are found in the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} fall under this category, e.g. [إِبْرَاهِيمُ]{.ar} [EibrAhImu]{.trn} [E#ibrAhIm]{.trn2}.

   However, if the non-Arabic origin name comprises three letters then it shall be fully changing, e.g., [نُوحٌ]{.ar} [nUHun]{.trn} [#nUH]{.trn2}.
5. The male name is of the pattern [فُعَل]{.ar}. The only common name that falls in this category is [عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn} [e#umar]{.trn2} of the root [عمر]{.arroot}.

   Interestingly, the fully-changing name [e#amr]{.trn2} is written with a silent [و]{.ar} at its end when in the u- and i-states in order to distinguish it from the more common name [e#umar]{.trn2}. Otherwise, both names would appear identical when written without vowel marks, thus: [عمر]{.ar}.

   Name|u-state|a-state|i-state
   :-|:--|:--|:--
   [e#amr]{.trn2}|[عَمْرٌو]{.ar} [eamrun]{.trn}| [عَمْرًا]{.ar} [eamran]{.trn}|[عَمْرٍو]{.ar} [eamrin]{.trn}
   [e#umar]{.trn2}|[عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn}| [عُمَرَ]{.ar} [eumara]{.trn}|[عُمَرَ]{.ar} [eumara]{.trn}

There are other categories of non-fully-changing male names as well but they are rare so we won't worry about them.

## Female names

Here are some examples of female names: 

+ [جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar} [jamIlatu]{.trn} [#jamIlah]{.trn2}
+ [فَاطِمَةُ]{.ar} [faTimatu]{.trn} [#fATimah]{.trn2}
+ [زَيْنَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} [#zaynab]{.trn2}

Female names often, but not always, end with a feminine marker. They too are definite without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} but they differ from male names in that they are almost always non-fully-changing nouns. Therefore they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks. 

There are some female names that are fully-changing but they are rare so we won't worry about them.

Even when the name is originally a qualitative noun which is fully-changing, it will become non-fully-changing when used as a name. For example:

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatun]{.trn}  
"A beautiful (fem.) one came."

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatu]{.trn}  
"[#jamIlah]{.trn2} came."

### Place names

Place names are usually, but not always, feminine and non-fully-changing. Some place names have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

+ [مَكَّةُ]{.ar} [makkatu]{.trn} (fem.) Mecca
+ [مِصْرُ]{.ar} [miSru]{.trn} (fem.) Egypt
+ [ٱَلْعِرَاقُ]{.ar} [EaleirAqu]{.trn} (masc.) Iraq

## Writing nouns in this book

For convenience, henceforth, when we discuss nouns outside of a sentence, we will usually write them without final vowel marks (like [n]{.trn}-marks) and translate them without any indefinite article, e.g. [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} "girl".

Non-fully-changing nouns, when first introduced, will be marked with a superscript ◌^2^ to indicate that the final vowel has at most two variations when indefinite, not three, e.g. [صَحْرَاء^2^]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn}^2^ "desert".
