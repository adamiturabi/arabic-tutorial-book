# Proper nouns

## Introduction

Proper nouns are also known as names. Here are some examples of Arabic names:

| Men's |names | Women's |names |
|--:|:---|--:|:---|
|[مُحَمَّد]{.ar}         |[#muHammad]{.trn2}      | [عَائِشَة^2^]{.ar}     |[e#AEicah]{.trn2} |
|[سَعِيد]{.ar}         |[#saeId]{.trn2}         | [فَاطِمَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#faTimah]{.trn2} |
|[ٱَلْحَسَن]{.ar}        |[al-#Hasan]{.trn2}      | [حَفْصَة^2^]{.ar}      |[#HafSah]{.trn2} |
|[ٱَلنُّعْمَان]{.ar}      |[al-#nuemAn]{.trn2}     | [سُمَيَّة^2^]{.ar}      |[#sumayyah]{.trn2} |
|[طَلْحَة^2^]{.ar}      |[#TalHah]{.trn2}        | [جَمِيلَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#jamIlah]{.trn2} |
|[أُسَامَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#usAmah]{.trn2}        | [زَيْنَب^2^]{.ar}      |[#zaynab]{.trn2} |
|[عُثْمَان^2^]{.ar}     |[e#uvmAn]{.trn2}        | [مَرْيَم^2^]{.ar}      |[#maryam]{.trn2} |
|[عُمَر^2^]{.ar}       |[e#umar]{.trn2}         | [سُعَاد^2^]{.ar}      |[#sueAd]{.trn2} |
|[إِبْرَاهِيم^2^]{.ar}   |[#ibrAhIm]{.trn2}       | [أَسْمَاء^2^]{.ar}     |[#asmAE]{.trn2} |
|[عَبْد ٱللَّـٰه]{.ar}    |[e#abd #allAh]{.trn2}   | [لَيْلَىٰ^2^]{.ar}      |[#laylA]{.trn2} |
|[أَبُو بَكْر]{.ar}      |[#abU #bakr]{.trn2}     | [أُمّ حَبِيبَة^2^]{.ar}  |[#umm #HabIbah]{.trn2} |

| Place |names | Misc. |names |
|-:|:--|-:|:---|
|[مَكَّة^2^]{.ar}   |Mecca     |[رَمَضَان^2^]{.ar} |[#ramadAn]{.trn2} (a month) |
|[دِمَشْق^2^]{.ar}  |Damascus  |[أُحُد]{.ar}      |[#uHud]{.trn2} (a mountain)    |
|[مِصْر^2^]{.ar}   |Egypt     |[ٱَلنِّيل]{.ar}    |the Nile (a river)             |
|[ٱَلْقَاهِرَة]{.ar}  |Cairo     |[ٱَلْفَاتِحَة]{.ar}  |the [#fAtiHah]{.trn2} (a [sUrah]{.trn2}) |
|[ٱَلْهِنْد]{.ar}    |India     |                |                             |

Note the following points from the list abobe:

+ Although some names begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, most don't.
+ Many names are semi-flexible (indicated by [◌^2^]{.ar}).
+ Some names consist of more than a single word, like [عَبْد ٱللَّـٰه]{.ar}    [e#abd #allAh]{.trn2}

We will explain these and more details regarding proper nouns in this chapter.

## Definiteness of proper nouns

Proper nouns differ from common nouns and adjectival nouns in a couple of important ways:

+ All proper nouns, even if they don't begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, are definite. 
+ A proper noun which does not begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, and which is fully-flexible, shall have an [n]{.trn} mark, despite being definite.

The above points are exemplified in the following sentence:

[ذَهَبْتُ إِلَىٰ بَيْتِ مُحَمَّدٍ ٱلْكَرِيمِ وَزَيْنَبَ ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ.]{.ar}  
[pahabtu EilA bayti muHammadini -lkarImi wazaynaba -TTayyibah.]{.trn}  
"I went to the house of the noble [#muHammad]{.trn2} and the good [#zaynab]{.trn2}."

Note the above from the above example:

+ [مُحَمَّدٍ]{.ar} is fully-flexible so it has an [in]{.trn}-mark [◌ٍ]{.ar} in the i-state.
+ [زَيْنَبَ]{.ar} is semi-flexible so it does not have an [n]{.trn}-mark, and instead has an [a]{.trn} mark [◌َ]{.ar} in the i-state.
+ The proper nouns [مُحَمَّد]{.ar} and [زَيْنَب]{.ar} are describees in descriptive noun phrases.
+ Their describers ([ٱلْكَرِيمِ]{.ar} and [ٱلطَّيِّبَةِ.]{.ar}, respectively) have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to match the definiteness of the definite proper noun describees. Furthermore, they both end with [◌ِ]{.ar} because they match the i-state of their describees.

## Meanings of names

Many names are re-used from common nouns and adjectival nouns with positive meanings. Examples:

+ [مُحَمَّد]{.ar}         [#muHammad]{.trn2}      "a highly praised one~m~"
+ [سَعِيد]{.ar}         [#saeId]{.trn2}         "a happy (fortunate) one~m~"
+ [ٱَلْحَسَن]{.ar}        [al-#Hasan]{.trn2}      "the good one~m~"
+ [طَلْحَة]{.ar}      [#TalHah]{.trn2}    "an acacia (tree)"
+ [جَمِيلَة]{.ar}     [#jamIlah]{.trn2}   "a beautiful one~f~"

It is possible for these names to sometimes (technically) cause a sentence to have an ambiguous meaning. For example,

[جَلَسَ ٱلْحَسَنُ مَعَ سَعِيدٍ.]{.ar}  
[jalsa -lhasanu maea saeId]{.trn}  
"[al-#Hasan]{.trn2} sat with [#saeId]{.trn2}."  
or  
"The good one~m~ sat with a happy (fortunate) one~m~."  

Context would tell us whether the proper noun or the common/adjectival noun meaning is intended.

Note however the following sentence:

[ذَهَبَتْ جَمِيلَةُ إِلَىٰ ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jamIlatu Eila -lbayt.]{.trn}

This sentence can only be understood to use [جَمِيلَة]{.ar} with its proper noun meaning:

"[#jamIlah]{.trn2} went to the house."

This is because [جَمِيلَة]{.ar} is semi-flexible as a proper noun and fully-flexible as an adjectival/common noun. If [جَمِيلَة]{.ar} were intended to be used with its adjectival/common noun meaning then it would have an [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar} and the sentence would be:

[ذَهَبَتْ جَمِيلَةٌ إِلَىٰ ٱلْبَيْتِ.]{.ar}  
[pahabat jamIlatun Eila -lbayt.]{.trn}  
"A beautiful one~f~ went to the house."

We will learn why [جَمِيلَة]{.ar} is semi-flexible as a proper noun in section\ \@ref(proper-nouns-ending-with-looped-ta) below.

## Flexibility of proper nouns

In terms of their flexibility, proper nouns consist of two types:

i. Fully-flexible proper nouns.
i. Semi-flexible proper nouns.

We will treat each of them below.

### Fully-flexible proper nouns

Fully-flexible proper nouns may or may not begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}.

#### Names that begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}

If a proper noun begins with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} then the question of its flexibility is pretty much moot. 
This is because noun beginning with with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} display their state fully, regardless of whether or not they are semi-flexible without the [ٱَلْ]{.ar}. Examples:

<!--[ٱِسْمُ ٱلْإِمَامِ ٱلنُّعْمَانُ]{.ar}  
"The [#imAm]{.trn2}'s name is [al-#nuemAn]{.trn}"  -->
[ٱَلْحَسَنُ حَفِيدُ رَسُولِ ٱللَّـٰهِ صلى اللّه عليه وسلم.]{.ar}  
"[al-#Hasan]{.trn2} is the grandson of the messenger of [#allAh]{.trn2} (may [#allAh]{.trn2} grant peace and confer blessing upon him)."
(u-state displayed with [◌ُ]{.ar}.)

[سَأَلَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلنُّعْمَانَ عَنْ أَمْرٍ.]{.ar}  
"The man asked [al-#nuemAn]{.trn2} about a matter."  
(a-state displayed with [◌َ]{.ar}.)

[ذَهَبْنُ إِلَى ٱلْقَاهِرَةِ.]{.ar}  
"I went to Cairo."  
(i-state displayed with [◌ِ]{.ar}.)

Examples of names that begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar} are:

|||||
|--:|:---|--:|:---|
|[ٱَلْحَسَن]{.ar}      |[al-#Hasan]{.trn2}      |[ٱَلْقَاهِرَة]{.ar}    |Cairo
|[ٱَلْحُسَيْن]{.ar}     |[al-#Husayn]{.trn2}     |[ٱَلْهِنْد]{.ar}      |India 
|[ٱَلْعَبَّاس]{.ar}     |[al-e#abbAs]{.trn2}     |[ٱَلصِّين]{.ar}      |China 
|[ٱَلْزُّبَيْر]{.ar}     |[al-#zubayr]{.trn2}     |[ٱَلنِّيل]{.ar}      |the Nile 
|[ٱَلنُّعْمَان]{.ar}    |[al-#nuemAn]{.trn2}     |[ٱَلْفُرَات]{.ar}     |the Euphrates

#### Names that don't begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}

For names that don't begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}, the default assumption is that they are fully-flexible, unless they fall into one of the categories of semi-flexible nouns (which we will study soon).

Examples of fully-flexible names are:

|||||
|--:|:---|--:|:---|
|[مُحَمَّد]{.ar}         |[#muHammad]{.trn2}  |[مُعَاذ]{.ar}         |[#mueAp]{.trn2}  |
|[نُوح]{.ar}          |[#nUh]{.trn2}       |[سَعْد]{.ar}          |[#saed]{.trn2}   |
|[شُعَيْب]{.ar}         |[#cueayb]{.trn2}    |[عَمَّار]{.ar}         |[e#ammAr]{.trn2} |
|[عَلِيّ]{.ar}          |[e#alI]{.trn2}      |[حَسَّان]{.ar}         |[#HassAn]{.trn2} |
|[زَيْد]{.ar}          |[#zayd]{.trn2}      |[سَعِيد]{.ar}         |[#saeId]{.trn2}  | 
|[أَنَس]{.ar}          |[#anas]{.trn2}      |[أُحُد]{.ar}          |[#uHud]{.trn2} (a mountain) |

These are all masculine names.

Examples of sentences with fully-flexible proper nouns:

[زَيْدٌ غُلَامٌ طَيِّبٌّ.]{.ar}  
"Zayd is a good boy."

[شَكَرَ أَنَسٌ عَلِيًّا.]{.ar}  
"Anas thanked [e#alI]{.trn2}."

[لَبِسَ سَعِيدٌ قَمِيصَ نُوحٍ ٱلأَخْضَرَ.]{.ar}  
"[#saeId]{.trn2} wore [#nUH]{.trn2}'s green shirt."

### Semi-flexible proper nouns

The rules for the semi-flexibility of proper nouns are a little different from the rules for the semi-flexibility of common nouns and adjectival nouns that we learned in chapter\ \@ref(semi-flexible-nouns).
Proper nouns shall be semi-flexible if they fall under one of the categories below. Note that the categories are not mutually exclusive. That is: some semi-flexible proper nouns will fall into more than one category.

#### Names ending with [ة]{.ar}

All names ending with [ة]{.ar} shall be semi-flexible. This rule is specific to proper nouns. We have already seen that common nouns and adjectival nouns that end ith [ة]{.ar} are fully-flexible.

Most such proper nouns are feminine names. Examples:

|||||
|--:|:---|--:|:---|
|[خَدِيجَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#xadIjah]{.trn2}   |[مَيْمُونَة^2^]{.ar}    |[#maymUnah ]{.trn2} |
|[فَاطِمَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#faTimah]{.trn2}   |[صَفِيَّة^2^]{.ar}      |[#Safiyyah]{.trn2}  |
|[عَائِشَة^2^]{.ar}     |[e#AEicah]{.trn2}   |[خَوْلَة^2^]{.ar}      |[#xawlah]{.trn2}    |
|[سُمَيَّة^2^]{.ar}      |[#sumayyah]{.trn2}  |[جَمِيلَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#jamIlah]{.trn2}   |
|[حَفْصَة^2^]{.ar}      |[#HafSah]{.trn2}    |[مَكَّة^2^]{.ar}       |Mecca |

However, some masculine names may end with [ة]{.ar} too:

|||||
|--:|:---|--:|:---|
|[أُسَامَة^2^]{.ar}    |[#usAmah]{.trn2}   |[عِكْرِمَة^2^]{.ar}    |[e#ikrimah ]{.trn2} |
|[طَلْحَة^2^]{.ar}     |[#TalHah]{.trn2}   |[عُبَادَة^2^]{.ar}    |[e#ubAdah]{.trn2}   |









## Remove

Proper nouns are names of persons and places. Proper nouns are always definite. Despite being definite, they will often not begin with [ٱَلْ]{.ar}.



## Male names

Here are some examples of male names: 

+ [مُحَمَّدٌ]{.ar} [muHammadun]{.trn} [#muHammad]{.trn2}
+ [زَيْدٌ]{.ar} [zaydun]{.trn} [#zayd]{.trn2}
+ [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} [#saeId]{.trn2}
+ [عَلِيٌّ]{.ar} [ealiyyun]{.trn} [e#alI]{.trn2}
+ [سَعْدٌ]{.ar} [saedun]{.trn} [#saed]{.trn2}
+ [ٱَلْحَسَنُ]{.ar} [Ealhasanu]{.trn} [#al-#Hasan]{.trn2}
+ [أَسْعَدُ]{.ar} [Easeadu]{.trn} [E#asead]{.trn2}
+ [عُثْمَانُ]{.ar} [euvmAnu]{.trn} [e#uvmAn]{.trn2}
+ [طَلْحَةُ]{.ar} [Talhatu]{.trn} [#Talhah]{.trn2}
+ [إِبْرَاهِيمُ]{.ar} [EibrAhImu]{.trn} [E#ibrAhIm]{.trn2}
+ [عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn} [e#umar]{.trn2}

You can see that male names often have an [n]{.trn}-mark. This does not mean that they are indefinite. Rather, as we've mentioned above, proper noun are always definite. So, for example, it is possible for a proper noun with an [n]{.trn}-mark to begin a subject-information sentence, because it is definite:

[مُحَمَّدٌ رَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ.]{.ar}  
[muHammadun rajulun karImun.]{.trn}  
"[#muHammad]{.trn2} is a noble man."

<!-- [جَاءَ مُجَمَّدٌ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}  
  [jAEa muHammaduni -lkabIru.]{.trn}  
  "The noble [#muHammad]{.trn2} came."

FIXME: Isn't this a badal instead? Maybe remove this section. -->

Names are also often originally qualitative nouns with a good meaning. For example, [سَعِيدٌ]{.ar} [saeIdun]{.trn} is a qualitative noun meaning "happy".

Sometimes, it is not clear from the sentence itself whether a word is used as a qualitative noun, or as a name. For example:

[جَاءَ سَعِيدٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa saeIdun]{.trn}  
"A happy (masc.) one came."  
OR  
"[#saeId]{.trn2} came."

Many male names are fully changing but there are some that are non-fully-changing. A male name will be non-fully-changing if it falls under the following categories:

1. The male name ends with an [ان]{.ar} which is external to the word's root. This is regardless of whether or not the word was originally a qualitative noun. A name that falls under this category is [عُثْمَانُ]{.ar} [euvmAnu]{.trn} [e#uvmAn]{.trn2} of the root [عثم]{.arroot}.
2. The male name is on the pattern [أَفْعَل]{.ar}, e.g. [أَسْعَدُ]{.ar} [Easeadu]{.trn} [E#asead]{.trn2} of the root [سعد]{.arroot}.
3. The male name ends with a [ة]{.ar}. We have learned that [ة]{.ar} is a feminine marker for singular nouns. However, it is often found in male names and in this case it is not a feminine marker. When a male name ends with [ة]{.ar} then it will be non-fully-changing. An example of a male name that ends with [ة]{.ar} is [طَلْحَةُ]{.ar} [Talhatu]{.trn} [#Talhah]{.trn2}.
4. The male name is non-Arabic in origin, and comprises of more than three letters. Most of the earlier prophets' names that are found in the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} fall under this category, e.g. [إِبْرَاهِيمُ]{.ar} [EibrAhImu]{.trn} [E#ibrAhIm]{.trn2}.

   However, if the non-Arabic origin name comprises three letters then it shall be fully changing, e.g., [نُوحٌ]{.ar} [nUHun]{.trn} [#nUH]{.trn2}.
5. The male name is of the pattern [فُعَل]{.ar}. The only common name that falls in this category is [عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn} [e#umar]{.trn2} of the root [عمر]{.arroot}.

   Interestingly, the fully-changing name [e#amr]{.trn2} is written with a silent [و]{.ar} at its end when in the u- and i-states in order to distinguish it from the more common name [e#umar]{.trn2}. Otherwise, both names would appear identical when written without vowel marks, thus: [عمر]{.ar}.

   Name|u-state|a-state|i-state
   :-|:--|:--|:--
   [e#amr]{.trn2}|[عَمْرٌو]{.ar} [eamrun]{.trn}| [عَمْرًا]{.ar} [eamran]{.trn}|[عَمْرٍو]{.ar} [eamrin]{.trn}
   [e#umar]{.trn2}|[عُمَرُ]{.ar} [eumaru]{.trn}| [عُمَرَ]{.ar} [eumara]{.trn}|[عُمَرَ]{.ar} [eumara]{.trn}

There are other categories of non-fully-changing male names as well but they are rare so we won't worry about them.

## Female names

Here are some examples of female names: 

+ [جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar} [jamIlatu]{.trn} [#jamIlah]{.trn2}
+ [فَاطِمَةُ]{.ar} [faTimatu]{.trn} [#fATimah]{.trn2}
+ [زَيْنَبُ]{.ar} [zaynabu]{.trn} [#zaynab]{.trn2}

Female names often, but not always, end with a feminine marker. They too are definite without [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} but they differ from male names in that they are almost always non-fully-changing nouns. Therefore they don't have [n]{.trn}-marks. 

There are some female names that are fully-changing but they are rare so we won't worry about them.

Even when the name is originally a qualitative noun which is fully-changing, it will become non-fully-changing when used as a name. For example:

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatun]{.trn}  
"A beautiful (fem.) one came."

[جَاءَتْ جَمِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[jAEat jamIlatu]{.trn}  
"[#jamIlah]{.trn2} came."

### Place names

Place names are usually, but not always, feminine and non-fully-changing. Some place names have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

+ [مَكَّةُ]{.ar} [makkatu]{.trn} (fem.) Mecca
+ [مِصْرُ]{.ar} [miSru]{.trn} (fem.) Egypt
+ [ٱَلْعِرَاقُ]{.ar} [EaleirAqu]{.trn} (masc.) Iraq

## Writing nouns in this book

For convenience, henceforth, when we discuss nouns outside of a sentence, we will usually write them without final vowel marks (like [n]{.trn}-marks) and translate them without any indefinite article, e.g. [جَارِيَة]{.ar} [jAriyah]{.trn} "girl".

Non-fully-changing nouns, when first introduced, will be marked with a superscript ◌^2^ to indicate that the final vowel has at most two variations when indefinite, not three, e.g. [صَحْرَاء^2^]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn}^2^ "desert".
