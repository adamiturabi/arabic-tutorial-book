## Differentiating question words from their other functions

Many of the question words 
([أَ]{.ar}, [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, [كَيْفَ]{.ar}, etc.)
also have other functions.
For example,
in chapter\ \@ref(the-connected-nouns) we learned that [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, and [أَيّ]{.ar} are also connected nouns.
Many of the question nouns can also be used as _conditional nouns_ that we will study in chapter\ \@ref(...), if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

In this section, we will discuss briefly how to determine when words like
[أَ]{.ar}, [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, [كَيْفَ]{.ar}, etc.
are question words, and when they could have one of their other functions.

The basic principle regarding a question sentence is that it is to be treated as one unit. 
A word from within a question sentence is not, individually, affected by anything outside the question.
Let's try to understand this using an example.

Consider the following sentence:

[ٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar}  
"Ask: 'Which of them stood?'"

The speaker is commanding the addressed person to ask a group of people the question: 
"Which of them stood".

The question sentence is
[أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar} 
"Which of them stood".
This entire sentence is considered the direct doee of the verb of command [ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar} "ask!".
The question noun [أَيُّ]{.ar} is in the u-state because it is the subject of the question sentence.
It does not become [أَيَّ]{.ar} in the a-state because it is not, by itself, the direct doee of 
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}.
Rather, as we have just stated, the entire question sentence is the direct doee.
But because it is a sentence, and not an individual word, it does not indicate its state using, for example, an a-mark [◌َ]{.ar}.

Now, let's modify the example. Consider now this sentence:

[ٱِسْأَلْ أَيَّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar}  
Ask the one of them who stood!

Now, the noun [أَيَّ]{.ar} is in the a-state because it (individually) is the direct doee of the verb of command 
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}.
The speaker is now commanding the addressed person to ask (something) of only the person who stood, out of a group of people. The rest of the people are not to be asked.
Because the noun 
[أَيَّ]{.ar}
is individually affected by the preceding verb
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}
it is now not a question noun, and must be one of the other functions that the word
[أَيْ]{.ar} can have.
As a matter of fact, it is here a connected noun, and the sentence following it:
[قَامَ]{.ar} "he stood" is its connector.

The other noteworthy point regarding questions
(besides their being considered one unit)
is that they may only be preceded 
either by a verb of knowledge, (like [عَلِمَ]{.ar}, [دَرىٰ]{.ar}, etc.)
or by an expression indicating that the question is being quoted.
We have already seen an example of the question being quoted in the example:

[ٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar}  
"Ask: 'Which of them stood?'"

An example of a question being preceded by a verb of knowledge is:

[مَا عَلِمْتُ أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ]{.ar}  
I don't know whether he went or stayed.

Here the question sentence is: 
[أَذَهَبَ أَمْ مَكَثَ]{.ar}
"Did he go or did he stay?"

By the way, a question sentence may be part of a bigger question as well. For example:

[أَتَدْرِي أَيُّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟]{.ar}  
Do you know: which of them is in the house?

Note now the subtle difference in meaning if we change the state of [أَيّ]{.ar} in the above example from the u-state to the a-state:

[أَتَدْرِي أَيَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدَّارِ؟]{.ar}  
Do you know the one of them who is in the house?

When [أَيّ]{.ar} was in the u-state it was a question noun. And the speaker was asking the addressed person if he could figure out who, from among the group of people, was in the house.

When [أَيّ]{.ar} is in the a-state it is now a connected noun.
And the speaker is asking the addressed person if he is familiar with the person who is in the house.
Now he is not asking the addressed person to identify him, but rather if knows him as a person.

This difference is apparent with 
[أَيّ]{.ar} 
because it is a flexible noun whose state is indicated by the vowel mark at its end.
The same occurs in the other question nouns that are also connected nouns:
[مَا]{.ar}, and [مَنْ]{.ar}
but it won't often be as apparent because they are rigid nouns.

As a final note, sometimes, one of the words like 
[أَ]{.ar}, [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, [كَيْفَ]{.ar}, etc.
may be preceded by parts of a sentence that are neither quoting, nor a verb of knowledge.
Here we can be sure that the word is not a question word
and
must be one of its other functions. However,
it still may not be easy to figure out what that other function is.
Nevertheless, the meaning of the sentence can still usually be gleaned.
For example:

[فَلْتَدْخُلْ مِنْ أَيِّ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ شَاءَتْ]{.ar}  
"then let her enter from whichever of the doors of paradise she wishes."
