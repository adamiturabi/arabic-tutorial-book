# Questions

## 

Many of the question words 
([أَ]{.ar}, [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, [كَيْفَ]{.ar}, etc.)
also have other functions.
For example,
in chapter\ \@ref(the-connected-nouns) we learned that [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, and [أَيّ]{.ar} are also connected nouns.

In this section, we will discuss briefly how to determine when words like
[أَ]{.ar}, [مَنْ]{.ar}, [مَا]{.ar}, [كَيْفَ]{.ar}, etc.
are question words, and when they could have one of their other functions.

The basic principle regarding a question sentence is that it is to be treated as one unit. 
A word from within a question sentence should not, individually, be affected by anything outside the question.
Let's try to understand this using an example.

Consider the following sentence:

[ٱِسْأَلْ أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar}  
"Ask: 'Which of them stood?'"

The speaker is commanding the addressed person to ask a group of people the question: 
"Which of them stood".

The question sentence is
[أَيُّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar} 
"Which of them stood".
This entire sentence is considered the direct doee of the verb of command [ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar} "ask!".
The question noun [أَيُّ]{.ar} is in the u-state because it is the subject of the question sentence.
It does not become [أَيَّ]{.ar} in the a-state because it is not, by itself, the direct doee of 
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}.
Rather, as we have just stated, the entire question sentence is the direct doee.
But because it is a sentence, and not an individual word, it does not indicate its state using, for example, an a-mark [◌َ]{.ar}.

Now, let's modify the example. Consider now this sentence:

[ٱِسْأَلْ أَيَّهُمْ قَامَ]{.ar}  
Ask the one of them who stood!

Now, the noun [أَيَّ]{.ar} is in the a-state because it (individually) is the direct doee of the verb of command 
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}.
The speaker is now commanding the addressed person to ask (something) of only the person who stood, out of a group of people. The rest of the people are not to be asked.
Because the noun 
[أَيَّ]{.ar}
is individually affected by the preceding verb
[ٱسْأَلْ]{.ar}
it is now not a question noun, and must be one of the other functions that the word
[أَيْ]{.ar} can have.
As a matter of fact, it is here a connected noun, and the sentence following it:
[قَامَ]{.ar} "he stood" is its connector.

The other noteworthy point regarding questions
(besides their being considered one unit)
is that they may only be preceded 
either by a verb of knowledge, (like [عَلِمَ]{.ar}, [دَرىٰ]{.ar}, etc.)
or by an expression indicating that the question is a
