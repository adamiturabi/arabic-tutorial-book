# Introduction

All praises are due to [#allAh]{.trn2}. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in [#allAh]{.trn2} from the evil in our souls and from our sinful deeds. Whomever [#allAh]{.trn2} guides, no one can mislead. Whomever [#allAh]{.trn2} leads astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy of worship except [#allAh]{.trn2}. I also bear witness that [#muHammad]{.trn2} is His servant and messenger.

May the peace and blessings of [#allAh]{.trn2} be upon the Prophet [#muHammad]{.trn2}, his family, his companions, and those who followed them with good conduct.

## History of Arabic 

[#allAh]{.trn2}, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} 1400 years ago to the Prophet [#muHammad]{.trn2}, may [#allAh]{.trn2} grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the [#qurEAn]{.trn2} is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may [#allAh]{.trn2} grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. The Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken by the different tribes and in the different regions of the Arabian peninsula.

All languages change naturally over time. For example, English has changed to such a degree that the Old English language spoken 1400 years ago would be unintelligible to us today. So too did the spoken Arabic dialects begin to change. But as part of preserving His religion, [#allAh]{.trn2} preserved the Arabic language as well. This was by means of the efforts of scholars who recorded the original Arabic language of the time of the revelation.

In the process of preserving Arabic, a standard variety, known as Standard Arabic, emerged from among the various dialects of the Arabic of the early-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic period. Standard Arabic has a classical period centering around the third century of the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic era, during which it is called classical Standard Arabic, or simply Classical Arabic[^1]. The Arabic dialects of the late pre-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic and early [#islAm]{.trn2}ic periods are then referred to, collectively, as pre-classical Arabic. Classical Arabic was used as the language of religious scholarship, science, and literature in the [#islAm]{.trn2}ic world. As scholars developed new branches of religious and secular sciences, new terms and meanings were added to it that are termed post-classical. A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages and Arabicized, as needed by the different scientific disciplines. (Pre-classical Arabic itself had a few Arabicized foreign borrowings from neighboring languages.) These additions were, by and large, deliberate, done by scholars who were experts in their fields and also well versed in Classical Arabic, and validated by subsequent generations of scholarly discourse. Besides these needed additions, the grammar and core language remained remarkably unchanged.

[^1]: This definition of the term _Classical Arabic_ is not universally accepted, and other authors may use it to also include the Arabic of the late pre-[#islAm]{.trn2}ic and early [#islAm]{.trn2}ic period.

<!--Ahmad Al-Jallad, Damascus Psalm Fragment, p. 69-->
While Standard Arabic was thus preserved from major change and was used for literary purposes, the language that was spoken by Arabs in their day-to-day lives continued to change over time from the pre-classical Arabic dialects into the modern colloquial dialects. And so today, there exist two very distinct types of Arabic: the preserved Standard Arabic which is taught at schools and is primarily a written language, and the modern colloquial Arabic dialects which Arabs learn as their mother tongue and which are primarily only spoken and not written.

In modern times, many new words and meanings have been added to Standard Arabic, often via translation from Western languages, to keep up with technological advancements and modern media. 
<!--However, it must be said that these additions have often been done by translators rather than scholars in the field, and have sometimes lacked the deliberation seen in the post-classical additions to Standard Arabic. -->
This modern development of Standard Arabic is called Modern Standard Arabic. 
There are also a small amount of words, meanings, and grammatical usages, which existed in Classical Arabic, but which are deemed archaic, and are therefore largely unused, in Modern Standard Arabic.

Figure\ 1.1 (above) depicts this historical development of Standard Arabic.

## Scope of this book

In this book, we will study Standard Arabic. We will focus on the pre-modern language. If [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the [#qurEAn]{.trn2}, the [#HadIv]{.trn2}, and [#islAm]{.trn2}ic literature.

If your goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic, then this book may still be of help because the core language and the grammar are essentially the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on the modern language.

This book does not touch at all upon the modern colloquial dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.

## How to study from this book

We will start with the Arabic script and present in each chapter a new concept of Arabic grammar, together with examples. We will also give vocabulary for you to memorize and have chapter exercises. Unfortunately, some of the sentences we present, both as examples and as chapter exercises, because of their construction and subject matter, may seem of dubious usefulness to a learner wanting to learn practical usage. We ask that you overlook this and bear with us as we try to reinforce grammatical concepts. In answering the exercises, we strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and write down the answers on paper with a pen. 

We strongly recommend that you **not**:

+ answer the exercises verbally without writing them down,
+ look up the answers before attempting to write the answer yourself,
+ look up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them,
+ proceed to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises.

Be aware that while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a proficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by oneself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts independently.

You may also find yourself having to go back a few chapters every once in a while and revising the concepts therein. This is very normal and not a cause for any alarm. It may also prove beneficial to re-do the exercises of that chapter when this occurs.
