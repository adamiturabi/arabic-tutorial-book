# Subject-information sentences

## Introduction

In this chapter we will learn about a class of sentences called _subject-information sentences._ 
Subject-information sentences consist of two parts:

i. The _subject_. This is the topic of the sentence.
ii. The _information_. This gives us some information about the subject.

## Forming subject-information sentences

Here is a subject-information sentence:

"The building is a house."

The subject of the sentence is "the building". This means that the sentence is about "the building". 

The information is "a house". This means that the information that the sentence is giving us about the subject is that it is "a house".

Let's try to form this sentence in Arabic.

First we assemble the individual parts:

i. "The building" in Arabic is [ٱَلْبِنَاء]{.ar} [EalbinAE]{.trn} (masc.).
ii. "A house" is [بَيْت]{.ar} [bayt]{.trn} (masc.).

Next we put them both in the u-state. For subject-information sentences, both the subject and the information shall be in the u-state. Remember that the u-state is formed by putting an [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar} at the end of an indefinite noun, and a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar} at the end of a definite noun. Here are the two nouns in the u-state:

i. [ٱَلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar} [EalbinAEu]{.trn} (masc.) "the building" (u-state)
ii. [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} (masc.) "a house" (u-state)

In order to form this sentence in Arabic, we put the subject first and then the information. So we get:

[ٱَلْبِنَاءُ بَيْتٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEu bayt.]{.trn}  
"The building is a house."

But wait! Where is the Arabic word for "is"? It turns out that Arabic does not usually express any word for "is". Instead, the meaning of this word is implied.

Also, not that the final vowel mark at the end of the sentence is written but not pronounced. So we will write 
[بَيْتٌ]{.ar} but say
[bayt]{.trn}, not
[baytun]{.trn}.
This is in accordance with what we learned in section\ \@ref(pronouncing-the-end-of-a-sentence).

Now let's try reversing this sentence, and try making the sentence:

"The house is a building."

We follow the same procedure by assembling the individual parts of the sentence and putting them in the u-state:

i.  The subject: [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [Ealbaytu]{.trn} (masc.) "the house" (u-state)
ii. The information: [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn} (masc.) "a building" (u-state)

And then we put them together, first the subject and then the information:

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu binAE.]{.trn}  
"The house is a building."

and there we have our sentence.

## Matching the gender between the subject and the information

In the sentences above, both the subject and the information were masculine nouns. Now let's try forming a sentence where the subject and the information have different genders. Let's try saying:

"The building is a school."

i.   The subject: [ٱَلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar} [EalbinAEu]{.trn} (masc.) "the building" (u-state)
ii.  The information: [مَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar} [madrasatun]{.trn} (fem.) "a school" (u-state)

In the same manner as before we form the sentence by first writing the subject and then the information:

[ٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEu madrasah.]{.trn}  
"The building is a school."

We can also reverse this sentence:

[ٱَلْمَدْرَسَةُ بِنَاءٌ.]{.ar}  
[Ealmadrasatu binAE.]{.trn}  
"The school is a building ."

So we see that it is quite normal to have a sentence where the gender of the subject does not match the gender of the information. And we made no attempt to try change their gender by genderizing one of them to match the gender of the other. This is because both words
[ٱَلْبِنَاء]{.ar} [EalbinAE]{.trn} (masc.) "a building"
and
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [madrasah]{.trn} (fem.) "a school"
are non-genderizable words.

If either the subject or the information is a genderizable noun, the in this case the subject and the information are made to match each other in gender. For example, let's try to form the sentence:

"The mother is a teacher."

Here are the indiviual words that we will use to form the sentence:

i. The subject: "the mother": [ٱَلْأُمُّ]{.ar} [EalEummu]{.trn} (fem.) (u-state). This is a non-genderizable noun so we leave it as it is.
ii. The information: "a teacher". [مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallium]{.trn} (masc.) is the word for "a (male) teacher" in Arabic. It is a genderizable noun and in order to make it apply to the feminine subject, we feminize it to: [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimatun]{.trn} (fem.) "a (female) teacher" (u-state).

Now we can assemble the sentence:

[ٱَلْأُمُّ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu mueallimah.]{.trn}  
"The mother is a teacher~f~."

In the reverse sentence "The teacher is a mother.", we feminize "the teacher" again, which is now the subject of the sentence, to match the feminine noun in the information "a mother". So we get:

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ أُمٌّ.]{.ar}  
[Ealmueallimatu Eumm.]{.trn}  
"The teacher~f~ is a mother."

If the subject and the information apply to animate beings, then even if they are not genderizable, they will usually match each other in gender in order for the sentence to be meaningful. For example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ أَبٌ.]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu Eab.]{.trn}  
"The man is a father."

In the above sentence, both the subject
[ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar}
[Earrujul]{.trn}
(masc.) "the man"
and the information
[أَب]{.ar}
[Eab]{.trn}
(masc.) "a father" are non-genderizable nouns. But they match each other in gender because that is the only way for the sentence to be meaningful.

But if one of the non-genderizable nouns can be applied to both physical genders then the subject and information may mismatch in gender. For example, the noun [شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn} "a person" is a masculine noun that is applied to both male and female persons. So if the person being referred to is a woman, for example, then we can get an apparent mismatch in gender between the grammatical gender of the subject and the grammatical subject of the information. Example:

[ٱَلْأُمُّ شَخْصٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu caxS.]{.trn}  
"The mother is a (female) person."

[ٱَلشَّخْصُ مُعَلِّمَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EaccaxSu mueallimah.]{.trn}  
"The (female) person is a teacher~f~."

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَةُ شَخْصٌ.]{.ar}  
[Ealmueallimatu caxS.]{.trn}  
"The teacher~f~ is a (female) person."

In the above example, the grammatical genders mismatch between the subject and the information. But this is because we are matching with the physical gender of the person represented by the masculine noun [شَخْص]{.ar} [caxS]{.trn} "a person".

The same effect is seen when using the word [حَيَوان]{.ar} [HayawAn]{.trn} which is a masculine noun meaning "an animal". It can be applied to both male and female animals. So we can say:

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرٌّ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirr.]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat~m~."

and

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirrh.]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat~f~."


We assemble the individual parts of the sentence in the u-state:
and "a building" is [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn}. In order to say "The house is a building" we put the [subject]{.syn} first and put its [information]{.syn} after it. Both the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} are put in the u-state.

This kind of sentence is called a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. It consists of two parts:

1. The part before "is": "the house". This is who the sentence is about. We call this the [subject]{.syn} of the sentence.
2. The part after "is": "a building". This is telling us some information about the [subject]{.syn}. We call this the [information]{.syn}.

Arabic does not normally express the word "is". In order to express this sentence in Arabic we put the [subject]{.syn} first and then the [information]{.syn}. For these simple sentences the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} will be in the u-state.

"The house" is [ٱَلْبَيْتُ]{.ar} [albaytu]{.trn} and "a building" is [بِنَاءٌ]{.ar} [binAEun]{.trn}. In order to say "The house is a building" we put the [subject]{.syn} first and put its [information]{.syn} after it. Both the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} are put in the u-state.

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu binAEun.]{.trn}  
"The house is a building."

Now let's try saying "The man is a teacher."

"The man" is [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}. For "a teacher" we have two words in Arabic: 

+ [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher" 
+ [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a female teacher" 

Obviously "the man" can only be [مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} "a male teacher". So the sentence is:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun.]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

Let's try another example: "The animal is a cat."

"The animal" is [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}. For "a cat" we have two words:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

Usually, in Arabic [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat" is used for "a cat" if the animal's gender is not specified, or not important. So putting together the sentence we get:

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِرَّةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hirratun.]{.trn}  
"The animal is a cat."

Note that, in this sentence, the [subject]{.syn} [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} "the animal" is a masculine noun. And the [information]{.syn} 
[هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat" is a feminine noun. So the [subject]{.syn} and the [information]{.syn} do not match in gender. This is perfectly normal. We make the [information]{.syn} match the [subject]{.syn} in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the [information]{.syn}, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the [subject]{.syn}.

In this case there were separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the [information]{.syn}:

+ [هِرٌّ]{.ar} [hirrun]{.trn} "a male cat"
+ [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a female cat"

but both of these can be applied to the [subject]{.syn}, because the [subject]{.syn} [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [alHayawAnu]{.trn} (masc.) "the animal" is used for both male and female animals. [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} is chosen because it is commonly used for "a cat" as we have already explained.

We have already seen an example of matching the gender of the [information]{.syn} with the [subject]{.syn} in the example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu mueallimun.]{.trn}  
"The man is a (male) teacher."

## Detached pronouns

Pronouns are words used in place of nouns. They include words like "he", "she", "it", "you", "I", etc. So you can have a sentence with a noun, like:

"The man is a teacher."

Or you can replace the noun with a pronoun:

"He is a teacher."

The word "he" in the above sentence is a pronoun. In Arabic there are a few different kinds of pronouns. Here we will learn _detached pronouns_. They are called detached pronouns because they are not attached to any other word. There are another set of pronouns called _attached pronouns_ that we will learn later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

When talking about pronouns, it is beneficial to make use of a concept of grammar called _persons_.

In any kind of speech speech there are there are three types of _persons_ involved: 

1. The _speaking person_. This is the person who is speaking the speech. An example of a pronoun that refers to the speaking person is "I".
2. The _addressed person_. This is the person to whom the speaking-person is speaking. An example of a pronoun that refers to the addressed person is "you".
3. The _absent person_. This is the person or entity who, though he may or may not be physically present, is conversationally absent from the dialog between the speaking person and the addressed person. Examples of pronouns that refer to the absent person are "he", "she" and "it".

### Detached pronouns for the absent person

Here are the Arabic detached pronouns for the singular absent person.

1. [هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} "he".
2. [هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} "she".

Here are some examples of pair of sentences, each first with a noun, and then with a pronoun in place of the noun:

+ [ٱَلرَّجُلُ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
  [Earrajulu mueallimun.]{.trn}  
  "The man is a (male) teacher."
  
  [هُوَ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
  [huwa mueallimun.]{.trn}  
  "He is a (male) teacher."

+ [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ هُوَ.]{.ar}  
  [Ealmueallimu huwa.]{.trn}  
  "The (male) teacher is he."

  Note above that detached pronouns can replace the noun in the information too.

+ [ٱَلمَرْأَةُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ.]{.ar}  
  [Earrajulu -lmueallimatu.]{.trn}  
  "The woman is the (female) teacher."

  [هِيَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ.]{.ar}  
  [hiya -lmueallimatu.]{.trn}  
  "She is the (female) teacher."

+ [ٱَلْبَيْتُ بِنَاءٌ.]{.ar}  
  [Ealbaytu binAEun.]{.trn}  
  "The house is a building."

  [هُوَ بِنَاءٌ.]{.ar}  
  [huwa binAEun.]{.trn}  
  "It is a building."

  Note that Arabic uses the pronoun [هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} "he" to refer to the inanimate object "the house". This is because, as we know, all nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine. In translating the sentence to English we will employ the neutral pronoun "it" to make the sentence sound natural.

+ [ٱَلْبِنَاءُ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
  [EalbinAEu madrasatun.]{.trn}  
  "The building is a school."

  [هُوَ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}
  [huwa madrasatun.]{.trn}  
  or  
  [هِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}
  [hiya madrasatun.]{.trn}  
  "It is a school."

  Note that either [هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} "he" or [هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} "she" can be used in the above sentence because the gender of the subject [ٱَلْبِنَاءُ]{.ar} [EalbinAEu]{.trn} "the building" (masc.) mismatches the gender of the information [مَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar} [madrasatun]{.trn} "a school." (fem.).

  In such cases where the genders of the subject and the information do not match, then, generally speaking, the pronoun for either gender could be employed with the following guideline:

  Prefer to match the gender of the subject pronoun with the gender of the information, unless the noun being replaced with a pronoun is an animate being, in which case prefer to use the gender of the animate being. 

  So in the above sentence we will prefer to use [هِيَ مَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar} [hiya madrasatun]{.trn} because the information [مَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar} [madrasatun]{.trn} "a school" is feminine.

+ Here is an example with an animate being as the subject:

  [ٱَلْمَرْأَةُ إِنْسَانٌ.]{.ar}  
  [EalmarEatu InsAnun.]{.trn}  
  "The woman is a human."

  [هِيَ إِنْسَانٌ.]{.ar}  
  [hiya InsAnun.]{.trn}  
  "She is a human."

  Here, if we replace the noun [ٱَلْمَرْأَةُ]{.ar} [EalmarEatu]{.trn} "the woman" with a pronoun, we will prefer to use [هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} "she" even though the information [إِنْسَانٌ]{.ar} [EinsAnun]{.trn} "a human" is masculine.

### Detached pronouns for the addressed person and the speaking person

Here are the pronouns for the addressed person and the speaking person:

1. [أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} "you (masc.)".
4. [أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} "you (fem.)".
5. [أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} "I (masc. & fem.)". 

Note that The addressed person pronoun "you" has separate pronouns for the masculine and the feminine while the speaking person pronoun "I" has the same pronoun for both genders. Examples with these pronouns:

+ [أَنْتَ مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
  [Eanta mueallimun.]{.trn}  
  "You~masc.~ are a (male) teacher."

+ [أَنْتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ.]{.ar}  
  [Eanti -lmarEatu.]{.trn}  
  "You~fem.~ are the woman."

+ [ٱلْمُعَلِّمَةُ أَنَا.]{.ar}  
  [Ealmueallimatu Eana.]{.trn}  
  "The (female) teacher is I~fem.~."

+ [أَنَا مُعَلِّمٌ.]{.ar}  
  [Eana mueallimun.]{.trn}  
  "I~masc.~ am a (male) teacher."

## A definite noun as the [information]{.syn} {#chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info}

In all the examples so far, the [information]{.syn} has been an indefinite noun: "a building", "a teacher", "a cat", etc. It is also possible for the [information]{.syn} to be a definite noun:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lmueallimu.]{.trn}  
"The man is the (male) teacher."

The above sentence, although correct, is ambiguous. It can also be interpreted as a noun-phrase, meaning "the teacher-man", instead of the complete sentence "The man is the (male) teacher." Therefore, in order to disambiguate and make it clear that we mean the complete sentence, a _disambiguating pronoun_ is usually (not not always) inserted between the subject and the information.
Disambiguating pronouns are detached pronouns that match the subject of the sentence in gender. With a disambiguating pronoun, the sentence above becomes:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ هُوَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu  huwa-lmueallimu.]{.trn}  
"The man is the (male) teacher."

The disambiguating pronoun here is [هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} and is not translated. Here are some more examples of sentences with definite informations and disambiguating pronouns.

[ٱَلْبَيْتُ هُوَ ٱلْبِنَاءُ.]{.ar}  
[Ealbaytu -lbinAEu.]{.trn}  
"The house is the building."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ هِيَ ٱلْهِرَّةُ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnu hiya -lhirratu.]{.trn}  
"The animal is the cat."

## An indefinite noun as the [subject]{.syn}

How about making the [subject]{.syn} an indefinite noun? Can we say:

+ A house is a building.
+ A man is the teacher.

It turns out that sentences where the [subject]{.syn} is an indefinite noun are not as straightforward to express in Arabic. We will explore some ways of expressing them later if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

## The word "and"

Arabic uses [وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} to mean "and". It is written right next to the word after it without any space between it and the next word. 

[وَمَدْرَسَةٌ]{.ar}  
[wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"and a school"

[وَ]{.ar} [wa]{.trn} meaning "and" does not change the state of the noun following it. Examples:

[ٱَلْبِنَاءُ بَيْتٌ وَمَدْرَسَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[EalbinAEu baytun wa madrasatun]{.trn}  
"The building is a house and a school."

[أَخَذَ ٱلرَّجُلُ كِتَابًا وَقَلَمًا.]{.ar}  
[Eaxapa -rrajulu kitAban waqalaman]{.trn}  
"The man took a book and pen."

[دَخَلَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلْبَيْتَ.]{.ar}  
[daxalati -lmarEatu wa-ljAriyatu -lbayta]{.trn}  
"The woman and the girl entered the house."

We can also use [وَ]{.ar} to connect sentences:

[ٱلرَّجُلُ إِنْسَانٌ وَٱلْكَلْبُ حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu EinSAnun wa-lkalbu HayawAnun]{.trn}  
"The man is a human and the dog is an animal."
