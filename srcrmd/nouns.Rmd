# Nouns
<!-- title not called "Common nouns" because concepts are general to all nouns. However, only common nouns are discussed here.-->
## Introduction

Here are some examples of common nouns in Arabic:

Arabic word | Transcription|Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:----------------
[رَجُل]{.ar}  |[rajul]{.trn}     |man
[كِتَاب]{.ar} |[kitAb]{.trn}     |book
[بَيْت]{.ar}  |[bayt]{.trn}      |house
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} |[cajarah]{.trn}   |tree
[صَبْر]{.ar}  |[Sabr]{.trn}      |patience
[طَعَام]{.ar} |[TaeAm]{.trn}     |food

Note that the final letter in each word, above, does not have a vowel mark. This is because, for now, we are discussing each noun in isolation. 

When we discuss nouns in isolation we shall pronounce the looped [ة]{.ar} as a [h]{.trn}. Therefore, 
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} "tree", in isolation, is pronounced [cajarah]{.trn}, not [cajarat]{.trn}.

## Definiteness

### Indefinite nouns

In English, nouns that start with the word "a" are called indefinite nouns. For example: "a book". The word "a" is called the _indefinite article_.

There are three options to express the indefinite "a book" in Arabic:  

+ [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}
+ [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn}
+ [كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn} 

In order to make a noun indefinite in Arabic, i.e., to say "_a_ book", we need put an [n]{.trn}-mark to the final letter of the word. There are three [n]{.trn}-marks: the [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar}, the [an]{.trn}-mark [◌ً]{.ar}, and the [in]{.trn}-mark [◌ٍ]{.ar}. Putting any of these on the final letter of word gives it the meaning "a book".

### Definite nouns

In English, nouns that start with "the" are called definite nouns. For example: "the book".

There are three options to express the definite "the book" in Arabic:  

+ [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [EalkitAbu]{.trn}
+ [ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [EalkitAba]{.trn}
+ [ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [EalkitAbi]{.trn}

In order to make a noun definite in Arabic, i.e., to say "_the_ book", we take away the [n]{.trn}-mark from the final letter of the indefinite noun, but leave the short vowel marks [◌ُ]{.ar}, [◌َ]{.ar}, and [◌ِ]{.ar}. Also, we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} "the" to the beginning of the word. 
The prefix [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is called the *definite article*.
It begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} so the [hamzah]{.trn} will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence. And when it occurs in the beginning of a sentence, the [hamzah]{.trn} is pronounced with a [◌َ]{.ar} a-mark.

### Discussing indefinite and definite nouns in isolation

In Arabic, nouns can only be either definite or indefinite. For example, in an Arabic sentence, you have to say either "a book" or "the book". You can't say "book" without "a" or "the". We will discuss this in more detail in section\ \@ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns) below.

So, for convenience, when talking about the indefinite noun in isolation, and not in a sentence, we will often write it without the final [n]{.trn}-mark thus: [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book". And it will be understood, that when in a sentence, the noun shall have a final [n]{.trn}-mark.

Similarly, for convenience, when discussing the definite noun in isolation, and not in a sentence, we may write it without the final short vowel thus: [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [EalkitAb]{.trn} "the book".
And it will be understood, that when in a sentence, the noun shall have a final short vowel mark.

### Sun letters and moon letters

The noun “man” in Arabic is [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn}. To make this noun definite, we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word. But instead of becoming [ٱَلْرَجُل]{.ar} [alrajul]{.trn} the word becomes [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [arrajul]{.trn}. The [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the [ر]{.ar} gets doubled. This happens because the first letter [ر]{.ar} in the word [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} is from a group of letters called "sun letters". For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is put in the beginning, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.

The rest of the letters in the alphabet are called "moon letters" and for words that begin with moon letters, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, [ك]{.ar} is a moon letter and we have already seen that [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "book" becomes [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [alkitAb]{.trn} "the book".

The sun letters are [ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن]{.ar}.  
The moon letters are [ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي]{.ar}.

The names "sun letters" and "moon letters" were given because of the Arabic words for "sun" and "moon" respectively. "The sun" in Arabic is [ٱَلشَّمْس]{.ar} [accams]{.trn} which begins with [ش]{.ar} which causes the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. "The moon" is [ٱَلْقَمَر]{.ar} [alqamar]{.trn} which begins with [ق]{.ar} which does not cause the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. Thus [ش]{.ar} represents the sun letters and [ق]{.ar} represents the moon letters.

Here are some examples of words that begin with sun letters:

Noun | Definite noun
:-----------|:-----------
[رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} "man" | [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [arrajul]{.trn} "the man"  
[تَاجِر]{.ar} [tAjir]{.trn} "trader" | [ٱَلتَّاجِر]{.ar} [attAjir]{.trn} "the trader"  
[لُعْبَة]{.ar} [luebah]{.trn} "toy" | [ٱَللُّعْبَة]{.ar} [alluebah]{.trn} "the toy"  

## State

Nouns in Arabic can be in one of three _states_. You may think of the grammatical states of nouns like the physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. The same water can be in a solid ice state, or a liquid water state, or a gaseous water vapour state. Similarly, the same noun, in Arabic, may be in one of the three grammatical states:

1. u-state: demarked by a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar} or a [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar} at the end of the word.
2. a-state: demarked by a [a]{.trn}-mark [◌َ]{.ar} or a [an]{.trn}-mark [◌ً]{.ar} at the end of the word.
3. i-state: demarked by a [i]{.trn}-mark [◌ِ]{.ar} or a [in]{.trn}-mark [◌ٍ]{.ar} at the end of the word.

Here are the words "a book" and "the book" in their three states:

State         | Indefinite "a book" | Definite "the book"
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
u-state       |[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} 
a-state       |[كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} |[ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [alkitAba]{.trn} 
i-state       |[كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [alkitAbi]{.trn} 


The choice of which state a noun is in depends on its function in a sentence. For example, if the noun is a subject of a sentence, it will usually be in the u-state. And if it is used adverbially, it will often be in the a-state. And if it occurs after a preposition, it will be in the i-state. We will learn more about putting nouns in their different states throughout this book. 
Generally speaking, the u-state is the normal state. And there needs to be a reason to take the noun out of the u-state and into one of the other states.

<!--
Don't use because english uses different words, not modifying the ending of the same word:
By the way, some English words have state too: the words The words "he" and "him" refer to the same person. But sometimes we will use "he" and sometimes we will use "him", depending on the function of the word in the sentence. For example,

+ "He talked to the man." The word "he" is used here because it is the subject.
+ "The man gave the book to him." The word "him" is used here because it comes after the preposition "to".

In English grammar, _state_ is called _case_ instead. The above examples in English may help you in understanding the concept of _state_ in Arabic.

## Usage of definite and indefinite nouns

Consider the noun "time". In English we can make this noun definite using the definite article "the", for example, "The time to act is now." When translating this sentence to Arabic, we will correspondingly use the definite noun: [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".

In English, we can make "time" indefinite using indefinite articles like "a" or "some". For example, "There is a time for work and a time for play." and "We have some time before we need to leave." When translating these sentences to Arabic we will correspondingly use the indefinite noun in both these sentences: [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".

Consider now a third scenario: in English we can also use the word "time" with a general meaning without a definite or indefinite article. For example, "Time is money." However, in Arabic, a noun must be either definite or indefinite. So we must choose between [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time" and [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time". In Arabic, [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn}, being indefinite, can only mean "a time" or "some time". So [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} is then used when we wish to say "time" with a general meaning. This means that, in Arabic the definite noun is used in two ways: 

i. When the definite meaning is desired. For example, "We met at the time we had agreed upon." (Use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)
ii. When a general meaning is desired. For example, "There is nothing more valuable than time." (Again, use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)

Conversely, the indefinite nouns is used only when an indefinite meaning is desired. For example, "We agreed to meet at a certain time."(Use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".)

In a similar manner, the nouns "home" or "school" are often used in English without either "the" or "a". For example, "He goes to school." and "She went home.". In these cases, we will us the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in Arabic. So we will say [ٱَلْبَيْت]{.ar} [Ealbayt]{.trn} "the home" for English "home" and [ٱَلْمَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [Ealmadrasah]{.trn} "the school" for English "school".

But there is an additional complication: note that English often does not use an indefinte article, even when an indefinite meaning is intended. For example, "We don't need to leave right now; we have time." meaning "we have [_some_] time." Because of the indefinite meaning intended we will use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time" here.

This English usage of an indefinite meaning without an indefnite article is especially true with plurals. For example, "There are books in the bag." Here the intended meaning is "There are [some] books in the bag." Consequently, in Arabic, we will use the indefinite noun here: [كُتُب]{.ar} [kutub]{.trn} "[some] books" not [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

However, there are times when English uses a plural without a definite or indefinite article, and a general meaning is intended. For example, "Books contain knowledge." In this case, in Arabic we will use the definite noun [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

This topic may be a little difficult to comprehend right now because we have not yet learned how to form sentences. Later, you may refer back to this section as needed.
