# Nouns
<!-- title not called "Common nouns" because concepts are general to all nouns. However, only common nouns are discussed here.-->
## Introduction

Here are some examples of common nouns in Arabic:

Arabic word | Transcription|Definition
:-----------|:-----------|:----------------
[رَجُل]{.ar}  |[rajul]{.trn}     |man
[كِتَاب]{.ar} |[kitAb]{.trn}     |book
[بَيْت]{.ar}  |[bayt]{.trn}      |house
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} |[cajarah]{.trn}   |tree
[صَبْر]{.ar}  |[Sabr]{.trn}      |patience
[طَعَام]{.ar} |[TaeAm]{.trn}     |food

Note that the final letter in each word, above, does not have a vowel mark. This is because, for now, we are discussing each noun in isolation. 

When we discuss nouns in isolation we shall pronounce the looped [ة]{.ar} as a [h]{.trn}. Therefore, 
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} "tree", in isolation, is pronounced [cajarah]{.trn}, not [cajarat]{.trn}.

## Definiteness

### Indefinite nouns

In English, nouns that start with the word "a" are called indefinite nouns. For example: "a book". The word "a" is called the _indefinite article_.

There are three options to express the indefinite "a book" in Arabic:  

+ [كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}
+ [كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn}
+ [كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn} 

In order to make a noun indefinite in Arabic, i.e., to say "_a_ book", we need put an [n]{.trn}-mark to the final letter of the word. There are three [n]{.trn}-marks: the [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar}, the [an]{.trn}-mark [◌ً]{.ar}, and the [in]{.trn}-mark [◌ٍ]{.ar}. Putting any of these on the final letter of word gives it the meaning "a book".

### Definite nouns

In English, nouns that start with "the" are called definite nouns. For example: "the book".

There are three options to express the definite "the book" in Arabic:  

+ [ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [EalkitAbu]{.trn}
+ [ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [EalkitAba]{.trn}
+ [ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [EalkitAbi]{.trn}

In order to make a noun definite in Arabic, i.e., to say "_the_ book", we take away the [n]{.trn}-mark from the final letter of the indefinite noun, but leave the short vowel marks [◌ُ]{.ar}, [◌َ]{.ar}, and [◌ِ]{.ar}. Also, we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [Eal]{.trn} "the" to the beginning of the word. 
The prefix [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is called the *definite article*.
It begins with a connecting [hamzah]{.trn} so the [hamzah]{.trn} will be pronounced only in the beginning of a sentence. And when it occurs in the beginning of a sentence, the [hamzah]{.trn} is pronounced with a [◌َ]{.ar} a-mark.

### Discussing indefinite and definite nouns in isolation

In Arabic, nouns can only be either definite or indefinite. For example, in an Arabic sentence, you have to say either "a book" or "the book". You can't say "book" without "a" or "the". We will discuss this in more detail in section\ \@ref(usage-of-definite-and-indefinite-nouns) below.

So, for convenience, when talking about the indefinite noun in isolation, and not in a sentence, we will often write it without the final [n]{.trn}-mark thus: [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book". And it will be understood, that when in a sentence, the noun shall have a final [n]{.trn}-mark.

Similarly, for convenience, when discussing the definite noun in isolation, and not in a sentence, we may write it without the final short vowel thus: [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [EalkitAb]{.trn} "the book".
And it will be understood, that when in a sentence, the noun shall have a final short vowel mark.

### Sun letters and moon letters

The noun “man” in Arabic is [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn}. To make this noun definite, we add [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to the beginning of the word. But instead of becoming [ٱَلْرَجُل]{.ar} [alrajul]{.trn} the word becomes [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [arrajul]{.trn}. The [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the [ر]{.ar} gets doubled. This happens because the first letter [ر]{.ar} in the word [رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} is from a group of letters called "sun letters". For all nouns beginning with sun letters, when [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} is put in the beginning, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} becomes silent and the sun letter becomes doubled.

The rest of the letters in the alphabet are called "moon letters" and for words that begin with moon letters, the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} does not become silent and the moon letter does not become doubled. For example, [ك]{.ar} is a moon letter and we have already seen that [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "book" becomes [ٱَلْكِتَاب]{.ar} [alkitAb]{.trn} "the book".

The sun letters are [ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن]{.ar}.  
The moon letters are [ء ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي]{.ar}.

The names "sun letters" and "moon letters" were given because of the Arabic words for "sun" and "moon" respectively. "The sun" in Arabic is [ٱَلشَّمْس]{.ar} [accams]{.trn} which begins with [ش]{.ar} which causes the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. "The moon" is [ٱَلْقَمَر]{.ar} [alqamar]{.trn} which begins with [ق]{.ar} which does not cause the [ل]{.ar} in [ٱَلْ]{.ar} to be silent. Thus [ش]{.ar} represents the sun letters and [ق]{.ar} represents the moon letters.

Here are some examples of words that begin with sun letters:

Noun | Definite noun
:-----------|:-----------
[رَجُل]{.ar} [rajul]{.trn} "man" | [ٱَلرَّجُل]{.ar} [arrajul]{.trn} "the man"  
[تَاجِر]{.ar} [tAjir]{.trn} "trader" | [ٱَلتَّاجِر]{.ar} [attAjir]{.trn} "the trader"  
[لُعْبَة]{.ar} [luebah]{.trn} "toy" | [ٱَللُّعْبَة]{.ar} [alluebah]{.trn} "the toy"  

## State

Nouns in Arabic can be in one of three _states_. You may think of the grammatical states of nouns like the physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. The same water can be in a solid ice state, or a liquid water state, or a gaseous water vapour state. Similarly, the same noun, in Arabic, may be in one of the three grammatical states:

1. u-state: demarked by a [u]{.trn}-mark [◌ُ]{.ar} or a [un]{.trn}-mark [◌ٌ]{.ar} at the end of the word.
2. a-state: demarked by a [a]{.trn}-mark [◌َ]{.ar} or a [an]{.trn}-mark [◌ً]{.ar} at the end of the word.
3. i-state: demarked by a [i]{.trn}-mark [◌ِ]{.ar} or a [in]{.trn}-mark [◌ٍ]{.ar} at the end of the word.

Here are the words "a book" and "the book" in their three states:

State         | Indefinite "a book" | Definite "the book"
:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------
u-state       |[كِتَابٌ]{.ar} [kitAbun]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابُ]{.ar} [alkitAbu]{.trn} 
a-state       |[كِتَابًا]{.ar} [kitAban]{.trn} |[ٱَلْكِتَابَ]{.ar} [alkitAba]{.trn} 
i-state       |[كِتَابٍ]{.ar} [kitAbin]{.trn}  |[ٱَلْكِتَابِ]{.ar} [alkitAbi]{.trn} 


The choice of which state a noun is in depends on its function in a sentence. For example, if the noun is a subject of a sentence, it will usually be in the u-state. And if it is used adverbially, it will often be in the a-state. And if it occurs after a preposition, it will be in the i-state. We will learn more about putting nouns in their different states throughout this book. 
Generally speaking, the u-state is the normal state. And there needs to be a reason to take the noun out of the u-state and into one of the other states.

<!--
Don't use because english uses different words, not modifying the ending of the same word:
By the way, some English words have state too: the words The words "he" and "him" refer to the same person. But sometimes we will use "he" and sometimes we will use "him", depending on the function of the word in the sentence. For example,

+ "He talked to the man." The word "he" is used here because it is the subject.
+ "The man gave the book to him." The word "him" is used here because it comes after the preposition "to".

In English grammar, _state_ is called _case_ instead. The above examples in English may help you in understanding the concept of _state_ in Arabic.

## Usage of definite and indefinite nouns

Consider the noun "time". In English we can make this noun definite using the definite article "the", for example, "The time to act is now." When translating this sentence to Arabic, we will correspondingly use the definite noun: [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".

In English, we can make "time" indefinite using indefinite articles like "a" or "some". For example, "There is a time for work and a time for play." and "We have some time before we need to leave." When translating these sentences to Arabic we will correspondingly use the indefinite noun in both these sentences: [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".

Consider now a third scenario: in English we can also use the word "time" with a general meaning without a definite or indefinite article. For example, "Time is money." However, in Arabic, a noun must be either definite or indefinite. So we must choose between [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time" and [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time". In Arabic, [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn}, being indefinite, can only mean "a time" or "some time". So [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} is then used when we wish to say "time" with a general meaning. This means that, in Arabic the definite noun is used in two ways: 

i. When the definite meaning is desired. For example, "We met at the time we had agreed upon." (Use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)
ii. When a general meaning is desired. For example, "There is nothing more valuable than time." (Again, use [ٱَلْوَقْت]{.ar} [Ealwaqt]{.trn} "the time".)

Conversely, the indefinite nouns is used only when an indefinite meaning is desired. For example, "We agreed to meet at a certain time."(Use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time".)

In a similar manner, the nouns "home" or "school" are often used in English without either "the" or "a". For example, "He goes to school." and "She went home.". In these cases, we will us the definite article [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in Arabic. So we will say [ٱَلْبَيْت]{.ar} [Ealbayt]{.trn} "the home" for English "home" and [ٱَلْمَدْرَسَة]{.ar} [Ealmadrasah]{.trn} "the school" for English "school".

But there is an additional complication: note that English often does not use an indefinte article, even when an indefinite meaning is intended. For example, "We don't need to leave right now; we have time." meaning "we have [_some_] time." Because of the indefinite meaning intended we will use [وَقْت]{.ar} [waqt]{.trn} "a time" here.

This English usage of an indefinite meaning without an indefnite article is especially true with plurals. For example, "There are books in the bag." Here the intended meaning is "There are [some] books in the bag." Consequently, in Arabic, we will use the indefinite noun here: [كُتُب]{.ar} [kutub]{.trn} "[some] books" not [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

However, there are times when English uses a plural without a definite or indefinite article, and a general meaning is intended. For example, "Books contain knowledge." In this case, in Arabic we will use the definite noun [ٱَلْكُتُب]{.ar} [Ealkutub]{.trn} "the books".

This topic may be a little difficult to comprehend right now because we have not yet learned how to form sentences. Later, you may refer back to this section as needed.

## Grammatical gender

Some nouns designate animate beings like "a man", "a woman", "a dog", "a cow", "a teacher", etc.
Other nouns designate inanimate objects like "a book", "a house", "a hand", "a tree", "a city", "a food". 

With respect to the grammatical gender of these nouns, there are three grammatical genders in English:

1. The masculine gender. This is used for nouns that designate male human beings and also some male animals. The pronouns used for the masculine gender are "he", "him", and "his".
2. The feminine gender. This is used for nouns that designate female human beings, and also some female animals. The pronouns used for the feminine gender are "she" and "her".
3. The neutral gender. This is used for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals in general. The pronoun used for the neutral gender is "it".

In Arabic, there are only two grammatical genders: the masculine gender and the feminine gender.
All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. 
Nouns that designate male human beings are assigned the masculine grammatical gender. And
nouns that designate female human beings are assigned the feminine grammatical gender.
As for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals, these, too, are assigned either a masculine or a feminine gender. For example, [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book" in Arabic is masculine. And [شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} "tree" in Arabic is feminine.
We shall discuss this in more detail below.

### Nouns that designate animate beings.

In Arabic, in terms of their form, nouns that designate animate beings are in three categories:

1. The nouns for male and female animate beings are separate but related.
2. The nouns for male and female animate beings are separate and unrelated.
3. The same noun is used for both sexes.

We will discuss each of these categories below.

#### Related nouns for male and female animate beings

In Arabic for some nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for both sexes match each other. Here are some examples:

Arabic word |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[طِفْل]{.ar}  [Tifl]{.trn}        |masc.|a male child
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn}      |fem. |a female child
[إِنْسَان]{.ar}[EinsAn]{.trn}      |masc.|a male human being
[إِنْسَانَة]{.ar}[EinsAnah]{.trn}   |fem. |a female human being
[مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn}  |masc.|a male teacher
[مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar}[mueallimah]{.trn}|fem. |a female teacher
[كَلْب]{.ar}  [kalb]{.trn}        |masc.|a male dog
[كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbah]{.trn}    |fem. |a female dog
[هِرّ]{.ar}   [hirr]{.trn}      |masc.|a male cat
[هِرَّة]{.ar}  [hirrah]{.trn}    |fem. |a female cat

In each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun. For example,
[طِفْل]{.ar}  [Tifl]{.trn} is a male child, and 
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn} is a female child

As a matter of fact, the looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} is thus a feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other feminine markers besides looped [tAE]{.trn} but they are not as common and we will learn them later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.
 
Note that when we add looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to a masculine noun to make it a feminine noun, the final letter of the masculine noun gets an [a]{.trn}-mark. For example, in the case of [كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} "a male dog", in order to get the feminine noun [كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbatun]{.trn} "a female dog", [ب]{.ar} gets an [a]{.trn}-mark.

Even though the male and female animate beings have separate words, sometimes one of the words is used commonly two refer to both sexes. This is especially common when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence. For example,
[كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} (masc.) is used commonly for "a dog" and [هِرَّة]{.ar} [hirrah]{.trn} (fem.) may be used for "a cat".
Similarly, [طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn} (masc.) is commonly used to say "a child", regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl. This is done when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence, as, for example, in the sentence: "A child entered.".

In fact, the word [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female human being" is rarely used at all. Instead, the word
[إِنْسَان]{.ar} [EinsAn]{.trn} (masc.) is used to refer to "a human being" in general, regardless of actual gender.

#### Unrelated nouns for male and female animate beings

For other nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for the male and female sexes are completely unrelated. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[أَب]{.ar}   [Eab]{.trn}     |masc.|a father
[أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    |fem. |a mother
[غُلَام]{.ar} [gulAm]{.trn}   |masc.|a boy
[جَارِيَة]{.ar}[jAriyah]{.trn} |fem. |a girl
[أَسَد]{.ar}  [Easad]{.trn}   |masc.|a lion
[لَبْوَة]{.ar} [labwah]{.trn}  |fem. |a lioness
[ثَوْر]{.ar}  [vawr]{.trn}    |masc.|a bull
[بَقَرَة]{.ar} [baqarah]{.trn} |fem. |a cow

Even in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} feminine marker. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don't end with a feminine marker like looped [tAE]{.trn}. [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} "a mother" is one of these exceptions.

#### Using the same noun for both sexes

There are other nouns for animate beings where the same word is used for both sexes. The word itself will still be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[شَخْص]{.ar}  [caxS]{.trn}    |masc.|a person
[نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn}    |fem. |a self
[حَيَوَان]{.ar}[HayawAn]{.trn} |masc.|an animal
[طَائِر]{.ar} [TAEir]{.trn}   |masc.|a bird
[قِرْد]{.ar}  [qird]{.trn}    |masc.|a monkey
[حَمَامَة]{.ar}[HamAmat]{.trn} |fem. |a pigeon
[زَرَافَة]{.ar}[zarAfah]{.trn} |fem. |a giraffe

So for example [قِرْد]{.ar} [qirdun]{.trn} "a monkey" is grammatically masculine but it will be used for both a male and a female monkey.
Similarly, [شَخْص]{.ar}  [caxS]{.trn} (masc.) "a person" can be used to refer to persons of both genders.

Note also that [نَفْس]{.ar} [nafsun]{.trn} "a self" is a feminine noun but it does not end in a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that don't have a female marker, like [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} (fem.) "a mother".
Notably, [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn} is treated as feminine when it refers to the soul of a person. However, in constructions like "yourself", "himself", etc. it will conform to the gender of the person it is referring to. We shall see this in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.


### Nouns that designate inanimate objects

As mentioned earlier, nouns that designate inanimate objects are assigned a fixed grammatical gender. There is usually no discernable reason why some are assigned a masculine gender while others are assigned a feminine gender.

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn}   |masc.|a book
[بَيْت]{.ar}  [bayt]{.trn}    |masc.|a house
[قَلَم]{.ar}  [qalam]{.trn}   |masc.|a pen
[طَعَام]{.ar} [TaeAm]{.trn}   |masc.|a food
[مَاء]{.ar}  [mAE]{.trn}     |masc.|a water
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar}[madrasah]{.trn}|fem. |a school
[مَدِينَة]{.ar}[madInah]{.trn} |fem. |a city
[غُرْفَة]{.ar} [gurfah]{.trn}  |fem. |a room
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} |fem. |a tree
[شَمْس]{.ar}  [cams]{.trn}    |fem. |a sun
[قَمَر]{.ar}  [qamar]{.trn}   |masc.|a moon
[عِلْم]{.ar}  [eilm]{.trn}    |masc.|a knowledge
[قُوَّة]{.ar}  [quwwah]{.trn}  |fem. |a strength
[حَيَاة]{.ar} [HayAh]{.trn}   |fem. |a life
[مَوْت]{.ar}  [mawt]{.trn}    |masc.|a death

In these nouns as well, we note that feminine nouns usually end with the feminine marker looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. 
But here too, we find another exception:
[شَمْسٌ]{.ar} [camsun]{.trn} "a sun" which is feminine but does not end with a feminine marker.
These exceptions are not very many and, if [#allAh]{.trn} wills we will not find it hard to memorize them.

### Words with mismatched gender

We saw that there are some nouns that are feminine, but do not end with with a feminine marker like [ة]{.trn}. These were:

+ [أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    (fem.) "a mother"
+ [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn}    (fem.) "a self"
+ [شَمْس]{.ar}  [cams]{.trn}    (fem.) "a sun"

There are a few more nouns that are like this. One special category among them is body parts. Most body parts that come in pairs, are grammatically feminine, even if they don't end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[يَد]{.ar} [yad]{.trn} | fem. | a hand
[عَيْن]{.ar} [eayn]{.trn} | fem. | an eye
[أُذُن]{.ar} [Eupun]{.trn} | fem. | an ear
[قَدَم]{.ar} [qadam]{.trn} | fem. | a foot
[رِجْل]{.ar} [rijl]{.trn} | fem. | a leg (or foot)
[إِبْهَام]{.ar} [EibhAm]{.trn} | fem. | a thumb

One notable exception is [مَنْخَر]{.ar} [manxar]{.trn} (masc.) "a nostril" which is masculine, despite its occuring in a pair.

And the word for "a finger" or "a toe" is [إِصْبَع]{.ar} [EiSbae]{.trn}, which is feminine, despite its coming in more than a pair.
[سِنّ]{.ar} [sinn]{.trn} "tooth" is also feminine, despite its coming in more than a pair.

Conversely, nouns that end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}, yet are masculine are very rare. The most common of them is [خَلِيفَة]{.ar} [xalIfah]{.trn} (masc.) "a caliph".

There are also a few words which can be optionally assigned a masculine or feminine gender. Among these are:

+ [سُوق]{.ar} [sUq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "a market"
+ [طَرِيق]{.ar} [TarIq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "a path"

A good dictionary should mention the gender of all these exceptional words.
