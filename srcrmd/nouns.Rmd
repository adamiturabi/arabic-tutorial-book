## Grammatical gender

Some nouns designate animate beings like "a man", "a woman", "a dog", "a cow", "a teacher", etc.
Other nouns designate inanimate objects like "a book", "a house", "a hand", "a tree", "a city", "a food". 

With respect to the grammatical gender of these nouns, there are three grammatical genders in English:

1. The masculine gender. This is used for nouns that designate male human beings and also some male animals. The pronouns used for the masculine gender are "he", "him", and "his".
2. The feminine gender. This is used for nouns that designate female human beings, and also some female animals. The pronouns used for the feminine gender are "she" and "her".
3. The neutral gender. This is used for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals in general. The pronoun used for the neutral gender is "it".

In Arabic, there are only two grammatical genders: the masculine gender and the feminine gender.
All nouns in Arabic are either masculine or feminine in gender. 
Nouns that designate male human beings are assigned the masculine grammatical gender. And
nouns that designate female human beings are assigned the feminine grammatical gender.
As for nouns that designate inanimate objects and animals, these, too, are assigned either a masculine or a feminine gender. For example, [كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn} "a book" in Arabic is masculine. And [شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} "tree" in Arabic is feminine.
We shall discuss this in more detail below.

### Nouns that designate animate beings.

In Arabic, in terms of their form, nouns that designate animate beings are in three categories:

1. The nouns for male and female animate beings are separate but related.
2. The nouns for male and female animate beings are separate and unrelated.
3. The same noun is used for both sexes.

We will discuss each of these categories below.

#### Related nouns for male and female animate beings

In Arabic for some nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for both sexes match each other. Here are some examples:

Arabic word |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[طِفْل]{.ar}  [Tifl]{.trn}        |masc.|a male child
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn}      |fem. |a female child
[إِنْسَان]{.ar}[EinsAn]{.trn}      |masc.|a male human being
[إِنْسَانَة]{.ar}[EinsAnah]{.trn}   |fem. |a female human being
[مُعَلِّم]{.ar} [mueallim]{.trn}  |masc.|a male teacher
[مُعَلِّمَة]{.ar}[mueallimah]{.trn}|fem. |a female teacher
[كَلْب]{.ar}  [kalb]{.trn}        |masc.|a male dog
[كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbah]{.trn}    |fem. |a female dog
[هِرّ]{.ar}   [hirr]{.trn}      |masc.|a male cat
[هِرَّة]{.ar}  [hirrah]{.trn}    |fem. |a female cat

In each of the words in the table above, the feminine noun is formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun. For example,
[طِفْل]{.ar}  [Tifl]{.trn} is a male child, and 
[طِفْلَة]{.ar} [Tiflah]{.trn} is a female child

As a matter of fact, the looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} is thus a feminine marker for singular nouns. There are a couple of other feminine markers besides looped [tAE]{.trn} but they are not as common and we will learn them later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.
 
Note that when we add looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to a masculine noun to make it a feminine noun, the final letter of the masculine noun gets an [a]{.trn}-mark. For example, in the case of [كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} "a male dog", in order to get the feminine noun [كَلْبَة]{.ar} [kalbatun]{.trn} "a female dog", [ب]{.ar} gets an [a]{.trn}-mark.

Even though the male and female animate beings have separate words, sometimes one of the words is used commonly two refer to both sexes. This is especially common when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence. For example,
[كَلْب]{.ar} [kalb]{.trn} (masc.) is used commonly for "a dog" and [هِرَّة]{.ar} [hirrah]{.trn} (fem.) may be used for "a cat".
Similarly, [طِفْل]{.ar} [Tifl]{.trn} (masc.) is commonly used to say "a child", regardless of whether the child is a boy or a gitl. This is done when the actual gender is not particularly important for the meaning of the sentence, as, for example, in the sentence: "A child entered.".

In fact, the word [إِنْسَانَة]{.ar} [EinsAnah]{.trn} (fem.) "a female human being" is rarely used at all. Instead, the word
[إِنْسَان]{.ar} [EinsAn]{.trn} (masc.) is used to refer to "a human being" in general, regardless of actual gender.

#### Unrelated nouns for male and female animate beings

For other nouns that designate animate beings, the nouns for the male and female sexes are completely unrelated. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[أَب]{.ar}   [Eab]{.trn}     |masc.|a father
[أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    |fem. |a mother
[غُلَام]{.ar} [gulAm]{.trn}   |masc.|a boy
[جَارِيَة]{.ar}[jAriyah]{.trn} |fem. |a girl
[أَسَد]{.ar}  [Easad]{.trn}   |masc.|a lion
[لَبْوَة]{.ar} [labwah]{.trn}  |fem. |a lioness
[ثَوْر]{.ar}  [vawr]{.trn}    |masc.|a bull
[بَقَرَة]{.ar} [baqarah]{.trn} |fem. |a cow

Even in these nouns you can see that the feminine noun usually ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} feminine marker. There are only a few commonly used feminine nouns that don't end with a feminine marker like looped [tAE]{.trn}. [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} "a mother" is one of these exceptions.

#### Using the same noun for both sexes

There are other nouns for animate beings where the same word is used for both sexes. The word itself will still be either grammatically masculine or feminine. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[شَخْص]{.ar}  [caxS]{.trn}    |masc.|a person
[نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn}    |fem. |a self
[حَيَوَان]{.ar}[HayawAn]{.trn} |masc.|an animal
[طَائِر]{.ar} [TAEir]{.trn}   |masc.|a bird
[قِرْد]{.ar}  [qird]{.trn}    |masc.|a monkey
[حَمَامَة]{.ar}[HamAmat]{.trn} |fem. |a pigeon
[زَرَافَة]{.ar}[zarAfah]{.trn} |fem. |a giraffe

So for example [قِرْد]{.ar} [qirdun]{.trn} "a monkey" is grammatically masculine but it will be used for both a male and a female monkey.
Similarly, [شَخْص]{.ar}  [caxS]{.trn} (masc.) "a person" can be used to refer to persons of both genders.

Note also that [نَفْس]{.ar} [nafsun]{.trn} "a self" is a feminine noun but it does not end in a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. It is one of the small number of feminine nouns that don't have a female marker, like [أُمٌّ]{.ar} [Eummun]{.trn} (fem.) "a mother".
Notably, [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn} is treated as feminine when it refers to the soul of a person. However, in constructions like "yourself", "himself", etc. it will conform to the gender of the person it is referring to. We shall see this in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.


### Nouns that designate inanimate objects

As mentioned earlier, nouns that designate inanimate objects are assigned a fixed grammatical gender. There is usually no discernable reason why some are assigned a masculine gender while others are assigned a feminine gender.

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[كِتَاب]{.ar} [kitAb]{.trn}   |masc.|a book
[بَيْت]{.ar}  [bayt]{.trn}    |masc.|a house
[قَلَم]{.ar}  [qalam]{.trn}   |masc.|a pen
[طَعَام]{.ar} [TaeAm]{.trn}   |masc.|a food
[مَاء]{.ar}  [mAE]{.trn}     |masc.|a water
[مَدْرَسَة]{.ar}[madrasah]{.trn}|fem. |a school
[مَدِينَة]{.ar}[madInah]{.trn} |fem. |a city
[غُرْفَة]{.ar} [gurfah]{.trn}  |fem. |a room
[شَجَرَة]{.ar} [cajarah]{.trn} |fem. |a tree
[شَمْس]{.ar}  [cams]{.trn}    |fem. |a sun
[قَمَر]{.ar}  [qamar]{.trn}   |masc.|a moon
[عِلْم]{.ar}  [eilm]{.trn}    |masc.|a knowledge
[قُوَّة]{.ar}  [quwwah]{.trn}  |fem. |a strength
[حَيَاة]{.ar} [HayAh]{.trn}   |fem. |a life
[مَوْت]{.ar}  [mawt]{.trn}    |masc.|a death

In these nouns as well, we note that feminine nouns usually end with the feminine marker looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}. 
But here too, we find another exception:
[شَمْسٌ]{.ar} [camsun]{.trn} "a sun" which is feminine but does not end with a feminine marker.
These exceptions are not very many and, if [#allAh]{.trn} wills we will not find it hard to memorize them.

### Words with mismatched gender

We saw that there are some nouns that are feminine, but do not end with with a feminine marker like [ة]{.trn}. These were:

+ [أُمّ]{.ar}   [Eumm]{.trn}    (fem.) "a mother"
+ [نَفْس]{.ar}  [nafs]{.trn}    (fem.) "a self"
+ [شَمْس]{.ar}  [cams]{.trn}    (fem.) "a sun"

There are a few more nouns that are like this. One special category among them is body parts. Most body parts that come in pairs, are grammatically feminine, even if they don't end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.trn}. Here are some examples:

Arabic word  |Gender | Definition
:----------------------|:---|:----------------
[يَد]{.ar} [yad]{.trn} | fem. | a hand
[عَيْن]{.ar} [eayn]{.trn} | fem. | an eye
[أُذُن]{.ar} [Eupun]{.trn} | fem. | an ear
[قَدَم]{.ar} [qadam]{.trn} | fem. | a foot
[رِجْل]{.ar} [rijl]{.trn} | fem. | a leg (or foot)
[إِبْهَام]{.ar} [EibhAm]{.trn} | fem. | a thumb

One notable exception is [مَنْخَر]{.ar} [manxar]{.trn} (masc.) "a nostril" which is masculine, despite its occuring in a pair.

And the word for "a finger" or "a toe" is [إِصْبَع]{.ar} [EiSbae]{.trn}, which is feminine, despite its coming in more than a pair.
[سِنّ]{.ar} [sinn]{.trn} "tooth" is also feminine, despite its coming in more than a pair.

Conversely, nouns that end with a feminine marker like [ة]{.ar}, yet are masculine are very rare. The most common of them is [خَلِيفَة]{.ar} [xalIfah]{.trn} (masc.) "a caliph".

There are also a few words which can be optionally assigned a masculine or feminine gender. Among these are:

+ [سُوق]{.ar} [sUq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "a market"
+ [طَرِيق]{.ar} [TarIq]{.trn} (masc. or fem.) "a path"

A good dictionary should mention the gender of all these exceptional words.
