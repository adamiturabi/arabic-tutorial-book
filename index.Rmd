# Preface {-}

The primary texts of [#islAm]{.trn2} and much of its scholarly literature are in Arabic. However, there is a multitude of Muslims for whom Arabic is not a native language, yet who are familiar enough with English to study textbooks written in English. This goal of this book is to help them learn Arabic at a beginner's level so that they, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, can feel more connected to the primary texts and so that they can be empowered to begin to study [#islAm]{.trn2}ic literature.

This book is a teaching grammar and not a reference grammar. So, in the initial chapters, topics are presented sequentially at only a basic level, without treating them exhaustively, before moving on to the next topic. Furthermore, since this is a beginner's textbook, only the more common usages are explained.

We have also aimed to make this a self-teaching textbook so that diligent students should, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills, be able to study it without a instructor. In doing this, we have perhaps made the text more verbose than is usual for an instructor-taught textbook. If the reader finds our text too wordy and prefers a more concise style, we recommend *A New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language* by J. A. Haywood and H. M. Nahmad, 2nd edition, published by Lund Humphries.

In our experience, we have also realized that students are turned off by foreign grammatical terminology, whether Latin-based or Arabic. Terminology is necessary for any rigorous non-immersive study of language. So while we employ terminology, we have tried to make it natural in English. In this regard, we have often translated the meaning of Arabic grammar terms to English. The drawback to this approach, however, is that the student may not be able to immediately relate the terminology he has learned from this book to established terminology in other grammar textbooks. To remedy this to some extent, we provide a glossary in the appendix which maps the grammatical terminology used in this book to ther extablished Latin-based and Arabic-based counterparts.
