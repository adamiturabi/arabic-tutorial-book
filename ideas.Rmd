## Different types of structures with subject and information

Early in this book we studied the simple sentence, for example:

"The man is a teacher."

We said that this sentence consists of two parts:

1. The part before "is": "the man". This is the subject.
2. The part after "is": "a teacher". This is the information which tells us something about the subject.

In the following examples, in addition to the simple sentence above, we will give other sentences (or parts of sentences) that have the same subject and information but give somewhat different meanings.

Number|English                             | Arabic
:--|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------
1. |"The man is a teacher."             |[الرّجلُ معلمٌ]{.ar}
2. |"Indeed the man is a teacher."      |[إنّ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
3. |"that the man is a teacher."        |[أنّ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
4. |"but the man is a teacher."         |[لٰكِنّ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
5. |"maybe the man is a teacher."       |[لَعَلّ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
6. |"as if the man were a teacher."     |[كَأنّ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
7. |"if only the man were a teacher."   |[لَيْتَ الرّجلَ معلمٌ]{.ar}
8. |"The man was a teacher."            |[كانَ الرّجلُ معلمًا]{.ar}
9. |"The man became a teacher."         |[صارَ الرّجلُ معلمًا]{.ar}

FIXME: add لأنّ

In all of these examples there is a subject "the man", and an information "a teacher". Arabic uses different ways to express these kinds of sentences.

For examples 2 through 7 we use a particle before the subject that puts the subject in the a-state. The information remains in the u-state. We call these particles "the [إنّ]{.ar} family".

For examples 8 and 9 Arabic uses verbs. The subject is the doer of the verb and the information is the object. And just like all verbs, the doer is in the u-state while the object is in the a-state. There are a few other verbs that express a similar meaning of "became". We call these verbs "the [كان]{.ar} family".


### The [إنّ]{.ar} family

The particle has to come before the subject. Usually the subject comes right after this particle, and the information comes after the subject as in the examples above. However, if the subject is an indefinite noun, and the information is a prepositional phrase, then it is permissible to have the order {particle, information, subject}, although the normal order {particle subject information} is also possible. Here is an example:

Indeed a man is in the house.  
[إن رجلا في البيت]{.ar}  
[إن في البيت رجلا]{.ar}  

#### Adjectives

### The [كان]{.ar} family

[كان]{.ar} can be used with only a subject and no information as a complete sentence. For example,

[كان مَلِكٌ]{.ar}  
"A king was."

In English we would usually express this by saying "There was a king." But Arabic does not use "There" in this manner. Instead it uses the verb [كان]{.ar} with a subject and no information as we have just shown.

By the way, if this is howe we express "There was a king." then how to we express "There is a king"? This is not straightforward to express in Arabic but we will learn a few techniques later if Allah wills.

Similarly the verbs [أصبح]{.ar}, [أمسى]{.ar} and similar verbs may be used without an information as well. For example

[أصبح الرجلُ]{.ar}  
The man entered the morning (**rework**)
