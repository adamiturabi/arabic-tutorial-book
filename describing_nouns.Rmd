# Descriptive nouns

## Introduction

In Arabic there are some nouns called _descriptive nouns_. Here is an example:

Arabic word |Transcription| Gender | meaning
:-----------|:------------|:---|:-----------
[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [kabIrun]{.trn}   | masc. | anything big
[كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  | [kabIratun]{.trn} | fem.  | anything big

[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be applied to anything that can be described as "big", as long as it is designated by a masculine noun. Remember that all nouns, even those that designate inanimate beings, are either masculine or feminine. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be applied to "a big man" ([رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}) or "a big house" ([بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} (masc.)).

Similarly, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} may be applied to anything that can be described as "big" that is designated by a feminine noun. For example, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} may be applied to "a big cat" ([هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} (fem.)) or "a big tree" ([شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} (fem.)).

Descriptive nouns generally come in pairs: a masculine descriptive noun, and a feminine descriptive noun. The feminine descriptive noun is usually formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the end of a masculine descriptive noun, just like we saw for some common nouns. There are some descriptive nouns that form the feminine by using a different feminine marker. And there are a few descriptive nouns that can be used as feminine without any feminine marker. We will learn these later if Allah wills.

Descriptive nouns may seem a little strange because English does not commonly have such nouns. But there are a few that can help understand this concept:

In the sentence "I bought an antique.", the word "antique" can be applied to anything that is old and valuable, like an antique table or an antique car. 

Similarly, the word "dependent" can be used as a for a family member, like a spouse or a child, or for a dependent clause in a sentence, or for anything that depends on another thing.

In Arabic these nouns are very common. But they are a little difficult to translate in English because English does not commonly have these types of nouns. We will translate them using the word "one" like [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.) "a big one". This translation is a little awkward but it is difficult to come up with a better one.

## Adjectives

English uses  adjectives to describe nouns. For example, we can say "a big man". "Big" is the adjective, and "man" is the _described noun_.

Arabic does not technically have adjectives. In Arabic we use descriptive nouns instead. Fo example, in order to express "a big man", we put the described noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" first, and place the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) "a big one" after it. Then the descriptive noun "a big one" gives the meaning of the adjective "big":

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}
"a big man"

Similarly, for "the big tree" we say:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[accajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"the big tree"

Let's note a couple of things about descriptive nouns when they are used as adjectives:

+ The descriptive noun comes after the described noun. [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" comes after [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man".

+ The state of the descriptive noun  will match the state of the described noun. "A big man" is [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}. The described noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "man" is in the u-state. Therefore, the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" is also in the u-state. We haven't seen nouns in other states yet but if the described noun were in the a-state [رَجُلًا]{.ar} [rajulan]{.trn} " man", we would put the descriptive noun in the a-state as well [كَبِيرًا]{.ar} [kabIran]{.trn} "big": [رَجُلًا كَيِيرًا]{.ar} [rajulan kabIran]{.trn}.

+ If the described noun is indefinite then the descriptive noun will also be indefinite ([رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn} "a big man"). Similarly, if the described noun is definite then the descriptive noun will also be definite ([ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn} "the big tree").

+ If the described noun is masculine then the masculine descriptive noun is used. If the described noun is feminine than the feminine descriptive noun is used.

To summarize, when descriptive nouns are used as adjectives, they follow the described noun and match it in state, definiteness, and gender.

We now give a list of common descriptive nouns. We will give only the masculine descriptive noun. To form the feminine descriptive noun, you can add a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun, just like we have already seen for [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) and [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.). 

We will also generally translate the meaning using an English adjective, like "big", instead of "a big one". This is just for convenience. You must remember that descriptive nouns may be used as adjectives but they are actually nouns. We will see some examples of them being used as nouns later in this chapter if Allah wills.

## Descriptive nouns in sentences

We have learned that simple sentences have two parts: a subject, and an information. Both the subject and the information are put in the u-state. Let's see some examples of sentences with descriptive nouns.

### Indefinite descriptive noun as information

Our first example uses an indefinite descriptive noun in the information of a sentence:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kabIrun]{.trn}  

In the above sentence, the subject is a common noun [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrujulu]{.trn} "the man". The information is a descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big one". When the information of a sentence is an indefinite descriptive noun (as in this sentence), it is used to give the meaning of the adjective. So instead of saying "The man is a big one." we can translate this sentence as "The man is big."

### Gender of descriptive noun as information

In our next example, we have a feminine subject:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu kabIratun]{.trn}  
"The tree is big."

Note that since the subject [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" is a feminine noun, we use the feminine descriptive noun [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  [kabIratun]{.trn} "big" for the information. This is because, when first explaining simple sentences, we said that we make the information match the subject in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the subject.

This applies to sentence here because there are separate words for the masculine and feminine descriptive noun: [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) and [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.). And only one of these two [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.) can be applied to the subject because the subject is a feminine noun [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree".

So, since descriptive nouns generally occur in masculine and feminine pairs, when they are used as the information in a sentence, we will match the gender of the descriptive noun to match the gender of the subject.

### Definite descriptive noun as information

Now let's try using definite descriptive noun as the information

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

Since the descriptive noun is definite in the information, we translate it as "the big one" instead of "big". Remember that the translation "big" is only used if the descriptive noun in the information is indefinite.

But wait! There is an issue with this sentence. Didn't we see earlier in this chapter that 
[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}
means "the big tree"?

It turns out that when a definite descriptive noun is used after another definite noun we get two meanings:

1. A phrase with noun and an adjective. For example "the big tree".
2. A complete sentence with a subject and an information. For example "The tree is big."

Usually we are able to tell from context which of the two meanings is intended. And there is also another way to express the sentence to distinguish it from the phrase. We will learn this technique later if Allah wills.

So if we get two meanings from a definite descriptive noun following another definite noun, do we also 
get two meanings from an _indefinite_ descriptive noun following another indefinite noun? For example:

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}

Can this mean both:

+ "a big man"
+ "A man is big"

The answer is "no". This is because, as we've already mentioned, simple sentences can generally only start with a definite noun. So if there is an indefinite noun in the beginning it can only mean the phrase, like "a big man" in this example in this example.

### Descriptive noun as the subject

Descriptive nouns can be used in teh subject of a sentence just like other nouns. Here are some examples

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The (masc.) big one is a man."

[ٱَلسَّرِيعَةُ ٱلْهِرَّةُ]{.ar}  
[EassarIeatu -lhirratu]{.trn}  
"The (fem.) fast one is the cat."

We can also use descriptive nouns in both the subject and the information.

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru vaqIlun]{.trn}  
"The (masc.) big one is heavy."

[ٱَلْكَبِيرَةُ ٱلثَّقِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIratu -vvaqIlatu]{.trn}  
"The (fem.) big one is the heavy one." or "the heavy big-one".

These sentences seem very vague because they aren't telling us much. But they can be used in the context of other sentences where the speaker and listener both know to whom or to what "the big one" refers.

## Adjectives in sentences

Now let's try to have sentences where we use adjectives to describe the subject and the information. It's actually pretty straightforward. If we wish to use a descriptive noun as an adjective for either the subject or the information, we simply put the descriptive noun after the described noun and match it in state, definiteness, and gender. This is no different than what we've been doing so far. Let's see some examples:


[ٱَلْمَرْأَةُ أُمٌّ حَسَنَةٌ]{.ar}  
[EalmarEatu eummun Hasanatun]{.trn}  
"The woman is a good mother."

[ٱلثَّقِيلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
[EavvaqIlu -lkabIru kitAbun]{.trn}  
"The big heavy-one is a book."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}  
"The happy man is a good teacher."

[ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaqaratu -lkabIratu HayawAnun]{.trn}  
"The big cow is an animal."

[ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ حَيَوَانٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaqaratu HayawAnun kabIrun]{.trn}  
"The cow is a big animal."

This last example is interesting because we are using the masculine descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} instead of the feminine [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} even though the subject is the feminine noun [ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ]{.ar} [albaqaratu]{.trn} "the cow". This is because the descriptive noun is actually an adjective of the masculine described noun [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn} "an animal" (even though this noun is masculine it is used for both male and female animals). There is actually some flexibility here and later, if Allah wills, we will try to see how we can use feminine descriptive nouns in such situations as well.

### Exercises

The cat is a small animal.
"The heavy book is difficult."
