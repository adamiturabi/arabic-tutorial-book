# Describing nouns

// Maybe first show describing nouns and rules. Then later, (but in this same chapter) explain how they are regular nouns and give antique as an example.

We can use words to describe nouns. For example, we can say "a big man", "the small book". "Big" and "small" are _describing words_, and "man" and "book" are the _described nouns_.

In English the describing words are called adjectives. Adjectives come before the described noun, like "a big house". But in Arabic, describing words come after the described noun. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{lang=ar dir=rtl} means "big". Here are some examples of how it can be used as a describing word

djhrdelk ljkhrcf ljkhjklrdh

djhrdelk ljkhrcf ljkhjklrdh

```{r chunk-label3, echo = FALSE}
mytable <- read.table('mytable2.txt', sep="|", quote="", dec="/", colClasses="character", fill=TRUE)
knitr::kable(mytable, caption = 'A caption')
```

Let's note a couple of things:

+ In Arabic, the describing word comes after the describing noun. kabeer comes after bayt.

+ The state of the describer will match the state of the describing noun. In this case. "A big house" is baytun kabeerun. Both bayt and kabeer are in the u-state. And "in a big house" is fee beythin kabeerin. Both bayt and kabeer are in the i-state. In both cases the state of the describer kabeer matches the state of the described noun bayt.

+ If the described noun is indefinite then the desriber will also be indefinite (baytun kabeerun, fee baytin kabeerin). Similarly, if the described noun is definite then the desriber will also be definite (albaytu lkabeeru, fi -lbayti -lkabeeri).

But in Arabic the describing words are themselves nouns. So we use nouns to describe other nouns. This might seem a little strange but this can occur in English as well, although it is not very common. For example, the word "antique" is a noun. So we can say,

I bought an antique.

"An antique" here could be any item that is old and valuable; it may be a book, or a vase, or a car, for example. So "antique" is a noun but it is descriptive in meaning. And it could be applied to a variety of items that fit its description.

But antque can also be used as a describing word. So you could say,

I bought an antique vase.

Here "antique" is a describing word, and "vase" is the described noun.

Using the same word as a describing word and a noun is uncommon is English. For example, you can't say,

I bought a small.

This is not a complete sentence because "small" cannot be used as a noun by itself. It can only be a describing word. So you have to say something like

I bought a small book.

In Arabic, however, all descrbing words are nouns and can be used by, either by themselves like

I bought an antique

or as descrbing words, like

I bought an antique vase.

So, for example, [كَبِير]{lang=ar dir=rtl} is a noun which mean "a big person or thing". Used by itself, it can refer to anything which fits the descrition of being big, like a big man, or a big dog, or a big book, etc.

But it can also be used as a describing word. This table shows how describing words are used in Arabic.


means "a big house".

lso remember that we said that a describer is also a noun and it can be used by itself as a noun.

3aDheemun means someone or something great. It can be used as a describer:

_rajulun 3aDheemun_ 

means "a great man".

_3an rajulin 3aDheemin_ 

means "about a great man".

But we can use 3aDheem by itself too. If we say

_3an 3aDheemin_

by itself, it means "about someone or something great". Only context will tell us whether "a great person" is meant or "a great thing".
