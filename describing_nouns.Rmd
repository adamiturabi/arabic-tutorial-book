# Qualitative nouns

## Introduction

So far we have studied *designative nouns* like [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" and  [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house". These are called designative nouns because the noun designates a specific object or entity.

In this chapter we will study *qualitative nouns*. Qualitative nouns are a class of nouns that don't designate specific objects. Rather they describe some quality of an object.

## Adjectives in English

In English we usually use adjectives to describe nouns. For example, the word "big" is an adjective. It can be used to describe a noun in a noun-phrase. For example:

"a big car"

And it can be used as the information of a sentence, also describing a noun. For example:

"The car is big."

But it can't be used by itself as a noun. So we can't say, for example:

"The big is fast."

We would have to say something like:

"The big car is fast."

## Qualitative nouns in English

Consider the English word "antique". It is what we call a _qualitative noun_. It describes some quality of the object it refers to.

It can be used just like an adjective to describe a noun as part of a noun-phrase. For example:

"The antique table is expensive."

In the above sentence the adjective "antique" is describing the noun "table".

It can also be used as the information of a sentence, just like an adjective. For example:

"The table is antique."

But what makes it different from an normal adjective is that it can also be used by itself as a noun. For example:

"The antique is expensive."

Here "the antique" could refer to any entity that can be described by the quality of being old and valuable. The qualitative noun does not require any other noun in this sentence and can stand on its own.

## Qualitative nouns in Arabic

Qualitative nouns are rare in English. Adjectives are usually used when we want to describe a noun.

In Arabic, however, the situation is reversed. Arabic does not technically have adjectives. It only has qualitative nouns.

For example, [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is a qualitative noun which describes the quality of being small or little. Because it is a noun, and not an adjective, we will give it's technical translattion as "a little one" or "a small one", where "one" can refer to any entity, e.g., a person, an animal, an object, etc. But this translation may be a little awkward in English in some sentences, so we will often translate it as "little" or "small".

Notice that [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} has an [n]{.trn}-mark. This means it is indefinite and it is why we translated it as "_a_ little one". Instead of an [n]{.trn}-mark, it can be preceded by [ٱَلْ]{.ar} in order to give [ٱَلصَغِيرُ]{.ar} [aSSagIru]{.trn}  in which case it will be definite and mean "_the_ little/small one".

We can use this qualitative noun as a noun in a sentence. For example:

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lEummu -SSagIra.]{.trn}  
"The mother carried the little one."

Here we may infer that "the little one" refers to a child.

In addition to having the indefnite and definite property of nouns, qualitative nouns also have gender: they may be masculine or feminine. 

The masculine [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is used when the noun described by the qualitative noun is masculine, like [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house".

The feminine of most qualitative nouns is formed by adding the feminine marker [ة]{.ar}. Some qualitative nouns take other feminine markers, as we will see in later chapters, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

So in order to form the feminine of [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn}, we add [ة]{.ar} to it and it becomes [صَغِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [SagIratun]{.trn}.
The feminine [صَغِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [SagIratun]{.trn} is used when the noun described by the qualitative noun is feminine, like [شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} "a tree".

## Qualitative nouns in noun-phrases

The expression "a small house" is an example of a noun-phrase. It consists of a _describer_ and a _describee_. The adjective "small" is the describer and the noun "a house" is the describee.

In an English noun-phrase, the describer comes before the describee.

In an Arabic noun-phrase, a qualitative noun is used as the describer to give the meaning of the adjective. The describee comes first and the describer comes after the describee. Furthermore, the describer matches the describee in state, definiteness, and gender.

So in Arabic, in order to express "a small house", we put the [describee]{.syn} [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house" first, and place the qualitative noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} (masc.) "a small one" after it as the [describer]{.syn}. Then the qualitative noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} gives the meaning of the adjective "small":

[بَيْتٌ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[baytun SagIrun]{.trn}  
"a small house"

Here the [describee]{.syn} [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house" is masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. Therefore, the [describer]{.syn} [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} "a small one" is also is also masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. 
Similarly, for "the small tree" we say:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[accajaratu -SSagIratu]{.trn}  
"the small tree"

Here too the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ]{.ar} [aSSagIratu]{.trn} "the small one" matches the [describee]{.syn} [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" in being feminine, definite, and in the u-state.

Noun-phrases with qualitative nouns can be used in sentences. Here too, they give the meaning of adjectives. Examples:

[ذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ صَغِيرٍ.]{.ar}  
[pahaba EilA baytin SagIrin.]{.trn}  
"He went to a small house."

[ٱَلْجَارِيَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[EaljAriyatu -SSagIratu fi -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"The little girl is at school."

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ ٱلْغُلَامَ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lmarEatu -lgulAma -SSagIra.]{.trn}  
"The woman carried the little boy."

## Qualitative nouns in [subject-information]{.syn} sentences

### Indefinite qualitative nouns as the [information]{.syn}

We have just studied [رَجُلٌ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun SagIrun]{.trn} "a big man" as an example of a noun-phrase. Now let's take a look at the sentence

"The man is big."

This is a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. The noun "the man" is the [subject]{.syn} and the adjective "big" is the [information]{.syn}.

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we again remember that Arabic does not have adjectives and uses qualitative nouns instead. When an indefinite qualitative noun is used as the [information]{.syn} of a sentence, it gives the meaning of the adjective. For example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu SagIrun]{.trn}  
"The man is a big one." = "The man is big."

The indefinite qualitative noun [صَغِيرٌ]{.ar} [SagIrun]{.trn} is the [information]{.syn} of the sentence. Therefore, it gives the meaning of the adjective "big".

### Definite qualitative nouns as the [information]{.syn}

By the way, we can use a definite qualitative noun [ٱَلصَّغِيرُ]{.ar} [EaSSagIru]{.trn} as the [information]{.syn} too. But here it won't give the meaning of the adjective "big". Instead it will be translated as "the big one":

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu -SSagIratu.]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

By the way, this sentence above can also be a noun-phrase meaning "the big tree".  When a definite qualitative noun is used after another definite noun, and they are both in the u-state, then two meanings are possible:

1. A noun-phrase with a [describee]{.syn} and a [describer]{.syn}: "the big tree".
2. A complete sentence with a [subject]{.syn} and an [information]{.syn}: "The tree is the big one."

Usually we are able to tell from context which of the two meanings is intended. But, as we mentioned in section \@ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info-revis), we can add an untranslated detached pronoun between the subject and the information when we intend the complete sentence. For example,

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ هِيَ ٱلصَّغِيرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu hiya -SSagIratu.]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

So if we get two meanings from a definite qualitative noun following another definite noun, do we also 
get two meanings from an _indefinite_ qualitative noun following another indefinite noun? For example:

[رَجُلٌ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun SagIrun]{.trn}

Can this mean both:

+ "a big man"
+ "A man is big"

The answer is "no". This is because, as we've already mentioned, [subject-information]{.syn} sentences can generally only start with a definite noun. So if there is an indefinite noun in the beginning it can only mean the phrase, like "a big man" in this example in this example.

## Using qualitative nouns by themselves in a sentence

In the introduction to this chapter we mentioned how the English word "antique" can be used by itself as in the sentence, "The antique is expensive." So too can qualitative nouns be used by themselves in Arabic. Consider the sentences:

[جَاءَ رَجُلٌ غَنِيٌ وَرَجُلٌ فَقِيرٌ.كَان ٱلْغَنِيُّ حَزِينًا وَكَانَ ٱلْفَقِيرُ سَعِيدًا.]{.ar}  
[jAEa rajulun ganiyyun warajulun faqIrun. kAna -lganiyyu HazInan wakAna -lfaqIru saeIdan]{.trn}  
"A rich man and a poor man came. The rich one was sad and the poor one was happy."

Note how in the second sentence, the qualitative nouns [ٱَلْغَنِيُّ]{.ar} [Ealganiyyu]{.trn} "the rich one" and [ٱَلْفَقِيرُ]{.ar} [EalfaqIru]{.trn} "the poor one" are used by themselves without [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrujulu]{.trn}. It is understood from context that the qualitative nouns are referring to the two men mentioned in the first sentence.

We can use qualitative nouns by themselves in a sentence:

[ٱَلصَّغِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[EaSSagIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The big one (masc.) is a man."

[جَاءَ صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa SagIrun]{.trn}  
"A big one (masc.) came."  
From this sentence alone we don't know what entity "a big one" is referring to. But from context, we could infer that, for example, "A big _man_ came."

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lEummu -SSagIra]{.trn}  
"The mother carried the small one (masc.)."  
In this sentence, we may infer that "the small one" is a child.
