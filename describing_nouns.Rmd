# Describing nouns

// Maybe first show describing nouns and rules. Then later, (but in this same chapter) explain how they are regular nouns and give antique as an example.

We can use words to describe nouns. For example, we can say "a big man", "the small book". "Big" and "small" are the _descriptions_, and "man" and "book" are the _described nouns_.

In English the describing words are called adjectives. Adjectives come before the described noun, like "a big house". But in Arabic, describing words come after the described noun. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{lang=ar dir=rtl} means "big". Here are some examples of how it can be used as a describing word

| Arabic     | English
|-------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| [بَيْتٌ كَبِيرٌ]{lang=ar}<br>[baytun kabIrun]{.trn}         | a big house      |
| [ٱَلْبَيْتُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}<br>[albaytu -lkabIru]{.trn}       | the big house    |
| [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar}<br>[fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}       | in a big house   |
| [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar}<br>[fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn} | in the big house |


Let's note a couple of things:

+ In Arabic, the description comes after the described noun. [kabIr]{.trn} comes after [bayt]{.trn}.

+ The state of the description will match the state of the described noun. "A big house" is [baytun kabIrun]{.trn}. Both [bayt]{.trn} and [kabIr]{.trn} are in the u-state. And "in a big house" is [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}. Both [bayt]{.trn} and [kabIr]{.trn} are in the i-state. In both cases the state of the description [kabIr]{.trn} matches the state of the described noun [bayt]{.trn}.

+ If the described noun is indefinite then the desriber will also be indefinite ([baytun kabIrun]{.trn}, [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}). Similarly, if the described noun is definite then the desriber will also be definite ([albaytu -lkabIru]{.trn}, [fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn}).

## Descriptions are nouns too

In Arabic the descriptions are themselves nouns. So we use nouns to describe other nouns. This might seem a little strange but this can occur in English as well, although it is not very common. For example, the word "antique" is a noun. So we can say,

I bought an antique.

"An antique" here could be any item that is old and valuable; it may be a book, or a vase, or a car, for example. So "antique" is a noun but it is descriptive in meaning. And it could be applied to a variety of items that fit its description.

But "antique" can also be used as a description. So you could say,

I bought an antique vase.

Here "antique" is a description, and "vase" is the described noun.

As we said, a description being a noun is uncommon is English. But in Arabic all descriptions are actually nouns. So for example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} doesnt't actally mean adjective "big". It means the noun "someone or something big".

## Nouns with multiple descriptions

## Descriptions with prepositional phrases

In addition to describing nouns with description words, we may also describe them with a prepositional phrase. For example

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}
"A man in the house"

Here the noun "a man" is being described as being "in the house". Similarly,

[كِتَابٌ عَلَىٰ مَكْتَبٍ]{.ar}
[kitAbun ealA maktabin]{.trn}
A book on a desk.

Generally, only indefinite nouns can be described with prepositional phrases. But let's see what happens if we replace the indefinite nouns "a man" and "a book" in the examples above with definite nouns "the man" and "the book".

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}
['arrajulu fi -lbayti]{.trn}
"The man is in the house"

[ٱَلْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ مَكْتَبٍ]{.ar}
['alkitAbu ealA maktabin]{.trn}
The book is on a desk.

We now get the word "is" in the English meaning which means that these are now complete sentences. We will learn more about sentences in the next chapter.

## Move to a later chapter:

There is an exception to only indefinite nouns being described by prepositional phrases. Sometimes definite nouns may be described by prepositional phrases but only if the meaning of the noun is very general like [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} "Knowledge".


I bought a small.

This is not a complete sentence because "small" cannot be used as a noun by itself. It can only be a description. So you have to say something like

I bought a small book.

In Arabic, however, all descrbing words are nouns and can be used by, either by themselves like

I bought an antique

or as descrbing words, like

I bought an antique vase.

So, for example, [كَبِير]{lang=ar dir=rtl} is a noun which mean "a big person or thing". Used by itself, it can refer to anything which fits the descrition of being big, like a big man, or a big dog, or a big book, etc.

But it can also be used as a describing word. This table shows how describing words are used in Arabic.


means "a big house".

lso remember that we said that a description is also a noun and it can be used by itself as a noun.

3aDheemun means someone or something great. It can be used as a description:

_rajulun 3aDheemun_ 

means "a great man".

_3an rajulin 3aDheemin_ 

means "about a great man".

But we can use 3aDheem by itself too. If we say

_3an 3aDheemin_

by itself, it means "about someone or something great". Only context will tell us whether "a great person" is meant or "a great thing".
