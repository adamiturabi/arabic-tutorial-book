# Describing nouns

## Description words 

We can use words to describe nouns. For example, we can say "a big man", "the small book". "Big" and "small" are the _description words_, and "man" and "book" are the _described nouns_.

In English the description words are called adjectives. Adjectives come before the described noun, like "a big house". But in Arabic, description words come after the described noun. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{lang=ar dir=rtl} means "big". Here are some examples of how it can be used as a description word:

| Arabic     | English
|-------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}<br>[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}        | a big man        |
| [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}<br>[arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}      | the big man      |
| [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar}<br>[fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}       | in a big house   |
| [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar}<br>[fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn} | in the big house |


Let's note a couple of things:

+ In Arabic, the description word comes after the described noun. [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} comes after [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}.

+ The state of the description word  will match the state of the described noun. "A big man" is [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}. The state of the description word [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} matches the state of the described noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} which is the u-state. And "in a big house" is [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar} [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}. Both [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} and [كَبِيرٍ]{.ar} [kabIrin]{.trn} are in the i-state. In both cases the state of the description word matches the state of the described noun.

+ If the described noun is indefinite then the desriber will also be indefinite ([رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}, [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar} [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}). Similarly, if the described noun is definite then the desriber will also be definite ([ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}, [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar} [fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn}).

## Description words are nouns too

In Arabic the description words are themselves nouns. So we use nouns to describe other nouns. This might seem a little strange but this can occur in English as well, although it is not very common. For example, the word "antique" is a noun. So we can say,

I bought an antique.

"An antique" here could be any item that is old and valuable; it may be a book, or a vase, or a car, for example. So "antique" is a noun. And it could be applied to a variety of items.

But "antique" can also be used as a description word. So you could say,

I bought an antique vase.

Here "antique" is a description word, and "vase" is the described noun.

As we said, a description word being a noun is uncommon is English. But in Arabic all descriptions are actually nouns. So for example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} doesnt't actally mean adjective "big". It means the noun "someone or something big".

## Nouns with multiple description words

## Description phrases

In addition to describing nouns with description words, we may also describe them with a phrase. For example

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"A man in the house"

Here the noun "a man" is being described as being "in the house", which is a phrase. Similarly,

[رَجُلٌ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fI baytin]{.trn}  
"A man in a house"

Generally, only indefinite nouns can be described with  phrases. In the next chapter we will see what happene if we replace [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} in the examples above with [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}.

## Move to a later chapter:

There is an exception to only indefinite nouns being described by phrases. Sometimes definite nouns may be described by phrases but only if the meaning of the noun is very general like [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} "Knowledge".


I bought a small.

This is not a complete sentence because "small" cannot be used as a noun by itself. It can only be a description. So you have to say something like

I bought a small book.

In Arabic, however, all descrbing words are nouns and can be used by, either by themselves like

I bought an antique

or as descrbing words, like

I bought an antique vase.

So, for example, [كَبِير]{lang=ar dir=rtl} is a noun which mean "a big person or thing". Used by itself, it can refer to anything which fits the descrition of being big, like a big man, or a big dog, or a big book, etc.

But it can also be used as a describing word. This table shows how describing words are used in Arabic.


means "a big house".

lso remember that we said that a description is also a noun and it can be used by itself as a noun.

3aDheemun means someone or something great. It can be used as a description:

_rajulun 3aDheemun_ 

means "a great man".

_3an rajulin 3aDheemin_ 

means "about a great man".

But we can use 3aDheem by itself too. If we say

_3an 3aDheemin_

by itself, it means "about someone or something great". Only context will tell us whether "a great person" is meant or "a great thing".
