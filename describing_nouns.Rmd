# Descriptive nouns

In Arabic there are some nouns called _descriptive nouns_. For example:

Arabic word |Transcription| Gender | meaning
:-----------|:------------|:---|:-----------
[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [kabIrun]{.trn}   | masc. | a big one
[كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  | [kabIratun]{.trn} | fem.  | a big one

[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be used to designate anything that can be described as "big", as long as it is designated by a masculine noun. Remeber that all nouns, even those that designate inanimate beings, are either masculine or feminine. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be used to designate "a big man" ([رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}) or "a big house" ([بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} (masc.)).

Similarly, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} may be used to designate anything that can be described as "big" that is designated by a feminine noun. For example, "a big cat" ([هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} (fem.)) or "a big tree" ([شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} (fem.)).

Having a noun that can be used for multiple things may seem a little strange. English does not commonly have such nouns. But there are a few that can help understand this concept:

In the sentence "I bought an antique.", the word "antique" can be used to designate anything that is old and valuable, like an antique table or an antique car. 

Similarly, the word "dependent" can be used as a for a family member, like a spouse or a child, or for a dependent clause in a sentence, or for anyting that depends on another thing.

In Arabic these nouns are very common. But they are a little difficult to translate in English because English does not commonly have these types of nouns.

# Describing nouns

## Adjectives

We use adjectives to describe nouns. For example, we can say "a big man". "Big" is the adjective, and "man" is the _described noun_.

In English the adjective comes before the described noun. But in Arabic, the adjective comes after the described noun. 

For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} is an adjective that means "big". Here are some examples of how it is used:

| Arabic     | Transcription  |English |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------------|
| [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}        | [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}     | a big man        |
| [ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar}    | [arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}   | the big man      |
| [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar}     | [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}   | in a big house   |
| [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar} | [fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn} | in the big house |


Let's note a couple of things:

+ In Arabic, the adjective comes after the described noun. [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} comes after [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}.

+ The state of the adjective  will match the state of the described noun. "A big man" is [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}. The described noun [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "man" is in the u-state. Therefore, the adjective [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" is also in the u-state. Similarly "in a big house" is [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar} [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}. The described noun [بَيْتٍ]{.ar} [baytin]{.trn} "house" is in the i-state. Therefore, the adjective [كَبِير]{.ar} [kabIrin]{.trn} "big" is also in the i-state. 

+ If the described noun is indefinite then the desriber will also be indefinite ([رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}, [فِي بَيْتٍ كَبِيرٍ]{.ar} [fI baytin kabIrin]{.trn}). Similarly, if the described noun is definite then the desriber will also be definite ([ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [arrajulu -lkabIru]{.trn}, [فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar} [fi -lbayti -lkabIri]{.trn}).

Here are some more Arabic adjectives:

Arabic word |Transcription| meaning
:-----------|:------------|:------------
[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [kabIrun]{.trn}  | big
[صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [SagIrun]{.trn}  | small
[طَوِيلٌ]{.ar}   | [TawIlun]{.trn}  | long
[قَصِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [qaSIrun]{.trn}  | short
[ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}   | [vaqIlun]{.trn}  | heavy
[خَفِيفٌ]{.ar}   | [xafIfun]{.trn}  | light
[وَاسِعٌ]{.ar}   | [wAsieun]{.trn}  | wide
[ضَيِّقٌ]{.ar}    | [Dayyiqun]{.trn} | narrow
[قَدِيمٌ]{.ar}   | [qadImun]{.trn}  | old
[جَدِيدٌ]{.ar}   | [jadIdun]{.trn}  | new
[سَرِيعٌ]{.ar}   | [sarIeun]{.trn}  | fast
[بَطِيءٌ]{.ar}   | [baTIEun]{.trn}  | slow

## Nouns with multiple adjectives

## Adjectives can be used as nouns

We learned in the previous chapter that nouns have a state (u-state, a-state, or i-state) and that they can have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} to make them definite or an [n]{.trn}-mark to make them indefininte. And we just saw that adjectives also have state and can have either [ٱَلْ]{.ar} [al]{.trn} or an [n]{.trn}-mark. This makes them look very similar to nouns. In fact, adjectives can be used just like regular nouns.

If the word [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} is used by itself (not following another noun as an adjective) then it is itself a noun meaning "a big one". This noun can be applied to any big thing, like a big person, or a big animal, or a big object. Similarly [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [alkabIru]{.trn} means "the big one". 

This might seem a little strange but this can occur in English as well, although it is not very common. 

For example, the word "antique" is an adjective that can be used to describe, for example, "an antique vase" or "an antique table". But we can use "antique" by itself too without a described noun. So we can say,

"I bought an antique."

"An antique" here is a noun that could be any item that is old and valuable; it may be a book, or a vase, or a car, for example.

But we can't do this with all adjectives in English. We can't say, for example,

"I bought a big."

In Arabic, on the other hand, all adjectives can be used as nouns. But when we translate them to English we will use the word "one" so that the English translation makes sense. So, as we saw [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} as a noun means "a big one".

Similarly [فِي ٱلْكَبِيرِ]{.ar} [fi -lkabIri]{.trn} means "in the big one". "The big one" could be any big thing, like a big house. We don't know what the big things is exactly just from the sentence. Just like we don't know what the "antique" actually is from the sentence "I bought an antique."

When an adjective is used as a regular noun we will call it a _descriptive noun_.

### Describing descriptive nouns with adjectives

If an adjective is used as a descriptive noun, can we use describe that descriptive noun with another adjective?

Yes we can. Even in English if we use "antique" as a noun, we can describe it with another adjective. So we can say "a heavy antique". "Heavy" is the adjective, and "antique" is the described noun.

Similarly we can say

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ٱلثَّقِيلُ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru -vvaqIlu]{.trn}  
"the heavy big-one"

[فِي كَبِيرٍ ثَقِيلٍ]{.ar}  
[fI kabIrin vaqIlin]{.trn}  
"in a heavy big-one"

## Description phrases

In addition to describing nouns with adjectives, we may also describe them with a phrase. For example

[رَجُلٌ فِي ٱلْبَيْتِ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fi -lbayti]{.trn}  
"A man in the house"

Here the noun "a man" is being described as being "in the house", which is a phrase. Similarly,

[رَجُلٌ فِي بَيْتٍ]{.ar}  
[rajulun fI baytin]{.trn}  
"A man in a house"

Generally, only indefinite nouns can be described with  phrases. In the next chapter we will see what happene if we replace [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} in the examples above with [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrajulu]{.trn}.

## Move to a later chapter:

There is an exception to only indefinite nouns being described by phrases. Sometimes definite nouns may be described by phrases but only if the meaning of the noun is very general like [ٱَلْعِلْمُ]{.ar} "Knowledge".


I bought a small.

This is not a complete sentence because "small" cannot be used as a noun by itself. It can only be a description. So you have to say something like

I bought a small book.

In Arabic, however, all descrbing words are nouns and can be used by, either by themselves like

I bought an antique

or as descrbing words, like

I bought an antique vase.

So, for example, [كَبِير]{lang=ar dir=rtl} is a noun which mean "a big person or thing". Used by itself, it can refer to anything which fits the descrition of being big, like a big man, or a big dog, or a big book, etc.

But it can also be used as a describing word. This table shows how describing words are used in Arabic.


means "a big house".

lso remember that we said that a description is also a noun and it can be used by itself as a noun.

3aDheemun means someone or something great. It can be used as a description:

_rajulun 3aDheemun_ 

means "a great man".

_3an rajulin 3aDheemin_ 

means "about a great man".

But we can use 3aDheem by itself too. If we say

_3an 3aDheemin_

by itself, it means "about someone or something great". Only context will tell us whether "a great person" is meant or "a great thing".
