# Descriptive nouns

## Introduction

In Arabic there are some nouns called _descriptive nouns_. Here is an example:

Arabic word |Transcription| Gender | meaning
:-----------|:------------|:---|:-----------
[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [kabIrun]{.trn}   | masc. | anything big
[كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  | [kabIratun]{.trn} | fem.  | anything big

[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be applied to anything that can be described as "big", as long as it is designated by a masculine noun. Remember that all nouns, even those that designate inanimate beings, are either masculine or feminine. For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} may be applied to "a big man" ([رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn}) or "a big house" ([بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} (masc.)).

Similarly, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} may be applied to anything that can be described as "big" that is designated by a feminine noun. For example, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} may be applied to "a big cat" ([هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} (fem.)) or "a big tree" ([شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} (fem.)).

Descriptive nouns generally come in pairs: a masculine descriptive noun, and a feminine descriptive noun. The feminine descriptive noun is usually formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the end of a masculine descriptive noun, just like we saw for some common nouns. There are some descriptive nouns that form the feminine by using a different feminine marker. And there are a few descriptive nouns that can be used as feminine without any feminine marker. We will learn these later if Allah wills.

Descriptive nouns may seem a little strange because English does not commonly have such nouns. But there are a few that can help understand this concept:

In the sentence "I bought an antique.", the noun "antique" can be applied to anything that is old and valuable, like an antique table or an antique car. 

Similarly, the word "dependent" can be used as a for a family member, like a spouse or a child, or for a dependent clause in a sentence, or for anything that depends on another thing.

In Arabic these nouns are very common. But they are a little difficult to translate in English because English does not commonly have these types of nouns. We will translate them using the word "one" like [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.) "a big one". This translation is a little awkward but it is difficult to come up with a better one.

Here is a list of some  descriptive nouns. We will give only the masculine descriptive noun. To form the feminine descriptive noun, you can add a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the masculine noun, just like we have already seen for [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) and [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.). 

We will also generally translate the meaning using an English adjective, like "big", instead of "a big one". We will see, if Allah wills, how descriptive nouns can be used to give the meaning of adjectives.

Arabic word |Transcription| meaning
:-----------|:------------|:------------
[حَسَنٌ]{.ar}    | [Hasanun]{.trn}  | good
[سَيِّئٌ]{.ar}    | [sayyiEun]{.trn} | bad
[كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [kabIrun]{.trn}  | big
[صَغِيرٌ]{.ar}   | [SagIrun]{.trn}  | small
[قَدِيمٌ]{.ar}   | [qadImun]{.trn}  | old
[جَدِيدٌ]{.ar}   | [jadIdun]{.trn}  | new
[سَهْلٌ]{.ar}    | [sahlun]{.trn}   | easy
[صَعْبٌ]{.ar}    | [Saebun]{.trn}   | difficult
[طَوِيلٌ]{.ar}   | [TawIlun]{.trn}  | long

[بَطِيءٌ]{.ar}   | [baTIEun]{.trn}  | slow
[قَوِيٌّ]{.ar}    | [qawiyyun]{.trn} | strong
[ضَعِيفٌ]{.ar}   | [DaeIfun]{.trn}  | weak

## Descriptive nouns in noun-phrases

The expression "a big man" is an example of a noun-phrase. It consists of a [described-noun]{.syn} and a [describer]{.syn}. The noun "a man" is the [described-noun]{.syn} and the adjective "big" is the [describer]{.syn}.

English uses adjectives as [describers]{.syn}. The [describer]{.syn} comes before the [described-noun]{.syn}.

Arabic does not technically have adjectives. Instead, Arabic uses descriptive nouns as the [describer]{.syn} in a noun-phrase to give the meaning of the adjective. The [describer]{.syn} comes after the [described-noun]{.syn}, and matches the [described-noun]{.syn} in state, definiteness, and gender.

For example, in order to express "a big man", we put the [described-noun]{.syn} [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" first, and place the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) "a big one" after it as the [describer]{.syn}. Then the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} gives the meaning of the adjective "big":

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}  
"a big man"

Here the [described-noun]{.syn} [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" is masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. Therefore, the [describer]{.syn} [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" is also is also masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. 

Similarly, for "the big tree" we say:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[accajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"the big tree"

Here too the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar} [alkabIratu]{.trn} "big" matches the [described-noun]{.syn} [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" in being feminine, definite, and in the u-state.

Noun-phrases with descriptive nouns can be used in sentences. Here too, they give the meaning of adjectives. Examples:

[ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ أَبٌ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru Eabun]{.trn}  
"The big man is a father."

[أَكَلَ ٱلْأَسَدُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ ٱلْبَقَرَةَ ٱلْكَبِيرَةَ]{.ar}  
[Eakala -lEasadu -lkabIru -lbaqarata -lkabIrata]{.trn}  
"The big lion ate the big cow."

See how in this last example, the [described-noun]{.syn} [ٱلْبَقَرَةَ]{.ar} [albaqarata]{.trn} is the object of a verb and is therefore in the a-state. Therefore the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلْكَبِيرَةَ]{.ar} [alkabIrata]{.trn} "big" is also in the a-state.

## Descriptive nouns as the [information]{.syn}

We have just studied [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn} "a big man" as an example of a noun-phrase. Now let's take a look at the sentence

"The man is big."

This is a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. The noun "the man" is the [subject]{.syn} and the adjective "big" is the [information]{.syn}.

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we again remember that Arabic does not have adjectives and uses descriptive nouns instead. In such a sentence where the [information]{.syn} is an adjective, Arabic uses the _indefinite_ descriptive noun to give the meaning of the adjective. For example,

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kabIrun]{.trn}  
"The man is big."

By the way, we can use a definite descriptive noun [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [EalkabIru]{.trn} as the [information]{.syn} too. But here it won't give the meaning of the adjective "big". Instead it will be translated as "the big one":

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

But wait! Didn't we see earlier in this chapter that 
[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}
means "the big tree"?

It turns out that when a definite descriptive noun is used after another definite noun, and they are both in the u-state, then two meanings are possible:

1. A noun-phrase with a [described-noun]{.syn} and a [describer]{.syn}: "the big tree".
2. A complete sentence with a [subject]{.syn} and an [information]{.syn}: "The tree is the big one."

Usually we are able to tell from context which of the two meanings is intended. 

So if we get two meanings from a definite descriptive noun following another definite noun, do we also 
get two meanings from an _indefinite_ descriptive noun following another indefinite noun? For example:

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}

Can this mean both:

+ "a big man"
+ "A man is big"

The answer is "no". This is because, as we've already mentioned, [subject-information]{.syn} sentences can generally only start with a definite noun. So if there is an indefinite noun in the beginning it can only mean the phrase, like "a big man" in this example in this example.

## Descriptive nouns in sentences

We have seen how a descriptive noun can be used as part of a noun-phrase to give the meaning of an adjective. But descriptive nouns are just like other nouns and they can occur by themselves as the subject or information of a sentence. 

### Descriptive nouns as the information of a sentence

When a descriptive noun occurs in the information of a sentence, it will match the described noun only in gender, but not necessarily in definiteness and state. This is because the rule that the descriptive noun matches the described noun in definiteness, gender, and state is valid only when the descriptive noun is part of a noun-phrase, not as the information of a sentence.

#### Indefinite descriptive nouns

When an indefinite descriptive noun occurs as the information of a sentence, it will give the meaning of an adjective. 

Our first example uses an masculine indefinite descriptive noun in the information of a sentence:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kabIrun]{.trn}  

In the above sentence, the subject is a common noun [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [arrujulu]{.trn} "the man". The information is a descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big one". When the information of a sentence is an indefinite descriptive noun (as in this sentence), it is used to give the meaning of the adjective. So instead of saying "The man is a big one." we can translate this sentence as "The man is big."

In our next example, we have a feminine subject:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu kabIratun]{.trn}  
"The tree is big."

Note that since the subject [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" is a feminine noun, we use the feminine descriptive noun [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar}  [kabIratun]{.trn} "big" for the information. This is because, when first explaining simple sentences, we said that we make the information match the subject in gender only if:

1. There are separate words for the masculine and feminine nouns for the information, and
2. Only one of the two words can be correctly applied to the subject.

These two conditions hold true when a descriptive noun is the information. This is because there are separate words for the masculine and feminine descriptive noun: [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) and [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.). And only one of these two [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} (fem.) can be applied to the subject because the subject is a feminine noun [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree".

So, since descriptive nouns generally occur in masculine and feminine pairs, when they are used as the information in a sentence, we will match the gender of the descriptive noun to match the gender of the subject.

#### Verbs like [كَانَ]{.ar}

Remember that sentences which begin with [كَانَ]{.ar} [kAna]{.trn} "was" and verbs like it, are both verbal sentences and subject-information sentences. When an indefinite descriptive noun occurs as the object of a verb like [كَانَ]{.ar} then the descriptive noun will be the information of the sentence and it can give the meaning of the adjective. Examples:

[صَارَ ٱلرَّجُلُ قَوِيًّا.]{.ar}  
[Sara -rrajulu qawiyyan]{.trn}  
"The man became strong."

[كَانَتِ ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ كَبِيرَةً]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ccajaratu kabIratan]{.trn}  
"The tree was big."

#### Definite descriptive noun as information

Now let's try using definite descriptive noun as the information

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

Since the descriptive noun is definite in the information, we translate it as "the big one" instead of the ajective "big". Remember that descriptive nouns are translated as adjectives only used when the descriptive noun in the information is indefinite.

But wait! It looks like there is a problem with this sentence. Didn't we see earlier in this chapter that 
[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}
means "the big tree"?

It turns out that when a definite descriptive noun is used after another definite noun, and they are both in the u-state, then two meanings are possible:

1. A phrase with noun and an adjective: "the big tree".
2. A complete sentence with a subject and an information: "The tree is big."

Usually we are able to tell from context which of the two meanings is intended. And there is also another way to express the sentence to distinguish it from the phrase. We will learn this technique later if Allah wills.

So if we get two meanings from a definite descriptive noun following another definite noun, do we also 
get two meanings from an _indefinite_ descriptive noun following another indefinite noun? For example:

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}

Can this mean both:

+ "a big man"
+ "A man is big"

The answer is "no". This is because, as we've already mentioned, simple sentences can generally only start with a definite noun. So if there is an indefinite noun in the beginning it can only mean the phrase, like "a big man" in this example in this example.

### Descriptive noun as the subject

Descriptive nouns can be used in the subject of a sentence just like other nouns. For example,

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The (masc.) big one is a man."

We can also use descriptive nouns in both the subject and the information.

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ ثَقِيلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru vaqIlun]{.trn}  
"The (masc.) big one is heavy."

These sentences seem very vague because they aren't telling us much. But they can be used in the context of other sentences where the speaker and listener both know to whom or to what "the big one" refers.

A descriptive noun can also occur as the doer or object of a verb:

[جَاءَ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa kabIrun]{.trn}  
"A big one came."  
From context, this would be understood to mean that "A big man came."

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lEummu -SSagIra]{.trn}  
"The mother carried the small one."

## REMOVE

[ٱَلْكَبِيرَةُ ٱلثَّقِيلَةُ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIratu -vvaqIlatu]{.trn}  
"The (fem.) big one is the heavy one." or "the heavy big-one".

[ٱَلسَّرِيعَةُ ٱلْهِرَّةُ]{.ar}  
[EassarIeatu -lhirratu]{.trn}  
"The (fem.) fast one is the cat."

## Adjectives in sentences

Now let's try to have sentences where we use adjectives to describe the subject and the information. It's actually pretty straightforward. If we wish to use a descriptive noun as an adjective for either the subject or the information, we simply put the descriptive noun after the described noun and match it in state, definiteness, and gender. This is no different than what we've been doing so far. Let's see some examples:


[ٱَلْمَرْأَةُ أُمٌّ حَسَنَةٌ]{.ar}  
[EalmarEatu eummun Hasanatun]{.trn}  
"The woman is a good mother."

[ٱلثَّقِيلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ كِتَابٌ]{.ar}  
[EavvaqIlu -lkabIru kitAbun]{.trn}  
"The big heavy-one is a book."

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ ٱلسَّعِيدُ مُعَلِّمٌ حَسَنٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -ssaeIdu mueallimun Hasanun]{.trn}  
"The happy man is a good teacher."

[ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaqaratu -lkabIratu HayawAnun]{.trn}  
"The big cow is an animal."

[ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ حَيَوَانٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Ealbaqaratu HayawAnun kabIrun]{.trn}  
"The cow is a big animal."

This last example is interesting because we are using the masculine descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} instead of the feminine [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} even though the subject is the feminine noun [ٱَلْبَقَرَةُ]{.ar} [albaqaratu]{.trn} "the cow". This is because the descriptive noun is actually an adjective of the masculine described noun [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn} "an animal" (even though this noun is masculine it is used for both male and female animals). There is actually some flexibility here and later, if Allah wills, we will try to see how we can use feminine descriptive nouns in such situations as well.

### Exercises

The cat is a small animal.
"The heavy book is difficult."
