# Descriptive nouns

## Introduction

Consider the English word "antique". 

It can be used as an adjective:

"The antique table is expensive."

In the above sentence the adjective "antique" is describing the noun "table".

However, the word "antique" can also be used by itself as a noun:

"The antique is expensive."

In this sentence we don't know exactly what the antique item was. It could have been an antique book, an antique car, an antique table, etc. So when it is used as a noun, it can be applied to any entity which fulfils the meaning of "antique".

In English most adjectives cannot be used as nouns. For example, "new" is an adjective, not a noun. We can't say:

"The new is expensive."

We would have to add a noun, for example:

"The new car is expensive."

In Arabic, the situation is almost reversed. Arabic does not technically have adjectives. It only has _descriptive nouns_.

The term *descriptive-noun* refers to a class of nouns that don't designate specific objects but rather can be applied to any object that fits the description given by the descriptive-noun.

For example, [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big one (masc.)" is a descriptive noun that may be applied to any masculine entity that can be described as "big". 
Similarly, [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} "a big one (fem.)" is a descriptive noun that may be applied to any feminine entity that can be described as "big". 

Descriptive nouns generally come in pairs: a masculine descriptive noun, and a feminine descriptive noun. The feminine descriptive noun is usually formed by adding a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar} to the end of a masculine descriptive noun, just like we saw for some common nouns. 
Remember that all nouns, even those that designate inanimate beings, are either masculine or feminine.

For example, [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" and  [بَيْتٌ]{.ar} [baytun]{.trn} "a house" are masculine. [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "a big one (masc.)" can be applied to these nouns. And [هِرَّةٌ]{.ar} [hirratun]{.trn} "a cat" and [شَجَرَةٌ]{.ar} [cajaratun]{.trn} "a tree" are feminine. [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn} "a big one (fem.)" can be applied to to these nouns.

Because [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} is a noun, it has an [n]{.trn}-mark which makes it indefinite: "*a* big one (masc.)". Instead, it can have [ٱَلْ]{.ar} which would make it definite: [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [arrujulu]{.trn} "*the* big one".

## Descriptive nouns in noun-phrases

The expression "a big man" is an example of a noun-phrase. It consists of a [described-noun]{.syn} and a [describer]{.syn}. The noun "a man" is the [described-noun]{.syn} and the adjective "big" is the [describer]{.syn}.

The terms *describer* and *described-noun* refer to the function and arrangement of words in the noun phrase. These are terms that relate to syntax. Syntax relates to the struture of language.

Whereas the term *descriptive-noun* refers to the meaning of a word, not its arrangement in a sentence or phrase. Therefore, the term *descriptive-noun* is semantic, which means that it is related to meaning. Semantics relates to the meaning of language.

English uses adjectives as [describers]{.syn}. In English the [describer]{.syn} comes before the [described-noun]{.syn}.

As we mentioned, Arabic does not technically have adjectives. Instead, in an Arabic noun-phrase, a descriptive noun is used as the [describer]{.syn} to give the meaning of the adjective. The [describer]{.syn} comes after the [described-noun]{.syn}, and matches the [described-noun]{.syn} in state, definiteness, and gender.

So in Arabic, in order to express "a big man", we put the [described-noun]{.syn} [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" first, and place the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} (masc.) "a big one" after it as the [describer]{.syn}. Then the descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} gives the meaning of the adjective "big":

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}  
"a big man"

Here the [described-noun]{.syn} [رَجُلٌ]{.ar} [rajulun]{.trn} "a man" is masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. Therefore, the [describer]{.syn} [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big" is also is also masculine, indefinite, and in the u-state. 

Similarly, for "the big tree" we say:

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar}  
[accajaratu -lkabIratu]{.trn}  
"the big tree"

Here too the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ]{.ar} [alkabIratu]{.trn} "big" matches the [described-noun]{.syn} [ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ]{.ar} [accajaratu]{.trn} "the tree" in being feminine, definite, and in the u-state.

Noun-phrases with descriptive nouns can be used in sentences. Here too, they give the meaning of adjectives. Examples:

[هِيَ شَجَرَةٌ كَبِيرَةٌ.]{.ar}  
[hiya cajaratun kabIratun.]{.trn}  
"It is a big tree."

[هُوَ ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ.]{.ar}  
[huwa -rrajulu -lkabIru.]{.trn}  
"He is the big man."

[ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ أَبٌ.]{.ar}  
[Earrajulu -lkabIru Eabun.]{.trn}  
"The big man is a father."

[أَكَلَ ٱلْأَسَدُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ ٱلْبَقَرَةَ ٱلْكَبِيرَةَ]{.ar}  
[Eakala -lEasadu -lkabIru -lbaqarata -lkabIrata]{.trn}  
"The big lion ate the big cow."

See how in this last example, the [described-noun]{.syn} [ٱلْبَقَرَةَ]{.ar} [albaqarata]{.trn} is the doee of a verb and is therefore in the a-state. Therefore the [describer]{.syn} [ٱلْكَبِيرَةَ]{.ar} [alkabIrata]{.trn} "big" is also in the a-state.

## Descriptive nouns in [subject-information]{.syn} sentences

### Indefinite descriptive nouns as the [information]{.syn}

We have just studied [رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [rajulun kabIrun]{.trn} "a big man" as an example of a noun-phrase. Now let's take a look at the sentence

"The man is big."

This is a [subject-information]{.syn} sentence. The noun "the man" is the [subject]{.syn} and the adjective "big" is the [information]{.syn}.

In order to express this sentence in Arabic, we again remember that Arabic does not have adjectives and uses descriptive nouns instead. When an indefinite descriptive noun is used as the [information]{.syn} of a sentence, it gives the meaning of the adjective. For example:

[ٱَلرَّجُلُ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[Earrujulu kabIrun]{.trn}  
"The man is a big one." = "The man is big."

The indefinite descriptive noun [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} is the [information]{.syn} of the sentence. Therefore, it gives the meaning of the adjective "big".

### Definite descriptive nouns as the [information]{.syn}

By the way, we can use a definite descriptive noun [ٱَلْكَبِيرُ]{.ar} [EalkabIru]{.trn} as the [information]{.syn} too. But here it won't give the meaning of the adjective "big". Instead it will be translated as "the big one":

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu -lkabIratu.]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

By the way, this sentence above can also be a noun-phrase meaning "the big tree".  When a definite descriptive noun is used after another definite noun, and they are both in the u-state, then two meanings are possible:

1. A noun-phrase with a [described-noun]{.syn} and a [describer]{.syn}: "the big tree".
2. A complete sentence with a [subject]{.syn} and an [information]{.syn}: "The tree is the big one."

Usually we are able to tell from context which of the two meanings is intended. But, as we mentioned in section \@ref(chap-smp-sent-sec-def-info-revis), we can add an untranslated detached pronoun between the subject and the information when we intend the complete sentence. For example,

[ٱَلشَّجَرَةُ هِيَ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ.]{.ar}  
[Eaccajaratu hiya -lkabIratu.]{.trn}  
"The tree is the big one."

So if we get two meanings from a definite descriptive noun following another definite noun, do we also 
get two meanings from an _indefinite_ descriptive noun following another indefinite noun? For example:

[رَجُلٌ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}
[rajulun kabIrun]{.trn}

Can this mean both:

+ "a big man"
+ "A man is big"

The answer is "no". This is because, as we've already mentioned, [subject-information]{.syn} sentences can generally only start with a definite noun. So if there is an indefinite noun in the beginning it can only mean the phrase, like "a big man" in this example in this example.

## Using descriptive nouns by themselves in a sentence

In the introduction to this chapter we mentioned how the English word "antique" can be used by itself as in the sentence, "The antique is expensive." So too can descriptive nouns be used by themselves in Arabic. Consider the sentences:

[جَاءَ رَجُلٌ غَنِيٌ وَرَجُلٌ فَقِيرٌ.كَان ٱلْغَنِيُّ حَزِينًا وَكَانَ ٱلْفَقِيرُ سَعِيدًا.]{.ar}  
[jAEa rajulun ganiyyun warajulun faqIrun. kAna -lganiyyu HazInan wakAna -lfaqIru saeIdan]{.trn}  
"A rich man and a poor man came. The rich one was sad and the poor one was happy."

Note how in the second sentence, the descriptive nouns [ٱَلْغَنِيُّ]{.ar} [Ealganiyyu]{.trn} "the rich one" and [ٱَلْفَقِيرُ]{.ar} [EalfaqIru]{.trn} "the poor one" are used by themselves without [ٱَلرَّجُلُ]{.ar} [Earrujulu]{.trn}. It is understood from context that the descriptive nouns are referring to the two men mentioned in the first sentence.

We can use descriptive nouns by themselves in a sentence:

[ٱَلْكَبِيرُ رَجُلٌ]{.ar}  
[EalkabIru rajulun]{.trn}  
"The big one (masc.) is a man."

[جَاءَ كَبِيرٌ]{.ar}  
[jAEa kabIrun]{.trn}  
"A big one (masc.) came."  
From this sentence alone we don't know what entity "a big one" is referring to. But from context, we could infer that, for example, "A big _man_ came."

[حَمَلَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ ٱلصَّغِيرَ.]{.ar}  
[Hamalati -lEummu -SSagIra]{.trn}  
"The mother carried the small one (masc.)."  
In this sentence, we may infer that "the small one" is a child.
