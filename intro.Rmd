# Introduction

[بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم]{lang=ar dir=rtl}

All praise is due to Allah, and may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon the Prophet Muhammad.

## History of Arabic 

The Quran was sent by Allah 1400 years ago to the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Quran is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. This is called Classical Arabic. The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken in the different regions of Arabia.

All languages evolve over time. For example, the Old English language spoken 1400 years would be unintelligible to us today. So too did Arabic evolve and the Arabic dialects that are spoken today in the different regions of the Arab world have changed considerably from the Classical Arabic dialects. But in order that the language of the Quran not be lost, scholars made efforts to preserve Classical Arabic. 

In preserving Classical Arabic, a standard version from among the different Classical Arabic dialects came to be used as a literary language. A wealth of literature exists in this "Preserved Standard Arabic": books on explanations of the Quran, Hadith sciences, Islamic jurisprudence, etc. As scholars developed new branches of science, new terms and meanings were added to this Arabic. A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages as needed by the different scientific disciplines. 

In modern times, many new words and meanings have been added to keep up with technological advancements and modern media. This modern version of Preserved Standard Arabic is called Modern Standard Arabic.

## Focus of this book

In this book, we will study Preserved Standard Arabic. We will focus on the pre-Modern language. If Allah wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the Quran, the Hadith, and Islamic literature.

If your goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic, then this book may help because the core language and the grammar is the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on Modern Standard Arabic.

This book does not touch at all on the modern colloquial dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.

## How to study from this book

We will start with the Arabic script and present in each chapter a new concept of Arabic grammar. We will also give vocabulary for you to memorize and have chapter exercises. We strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and go through the exercises by writing down the answers on paper with a pen. We strongly discourage you from answering the exercises verbally without writing them down and also from looking up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them.

This way the grammatical concepts  will be reinforced and you will start to gain a working vocabulary of Arabic, which is essential. In our opinion, grammar may seem initially difficult but, if Allah wills, with focus it will be possible to master it to a sufficient degree. The real

A standard form of this preserved Arabic 

The Messenger’s pbuh sayings and actions were recorded by his companions, also in the Arabic language. This Arabic language was also used to write books and is essentially the same as the written Arabic you will find today. Over time, new words, for new inventions and concepts were added to the language.

However, the Arabic that the Arabs spoke changed through the centuries. Just like the English spoken 1400 years ago is vastly different from the English spoken today. So too is spoken Arabic today different from the Standard Arabic used in the Quran, hadith and written works.

So there are a few different types of Arabic:

1. Preserved Arabic:
   a. Classical Arabic dialects: This is the Arabic language at the time of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. Different regions had their own dialect which differed a little from other dialects in pronunciation, vocabulary, etc. But they all formed one language. The Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in this language.
   b. Classical Standard Arabic: A standard form of the Classical Arabic dialects was used for writing books. As Arabic became the language of science, scientists added new words for new concepts. With the new vocabulary it is also called post-classical Arabic. 
   c. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): Very similar to Classical Standard Arabic but with much new vocabulary for words like “car”, “telephone”, and other modern inventions. Some features of Classical Standard Arabic are unused in Modern Standard Arabic.
2. Modern Arabic dialects: Each region in the Arab world has its own variety of colloquial dialect used by Arabs to converse with each other. The modern dialects have their roots in the classical dialects. Some dialects are understood by speakers of other dialects but others have changed so much that they are not easily understood outside their region.

This tutorial will, if Allah wills, help you teach yourself Preserved Arabic, focusing on Classical Standard Arabic.
