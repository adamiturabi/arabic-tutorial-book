# Introduction

[بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم]{lang=ar dir=rtl}

The Quran was sent by Allah 1400 years ago to His messenger Muhammad [صلى الله عليه وسلم]{lang=ar dir=rtl}. The language of the Quran is Arabic as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The Messenger’s pbuh sayings and actions were recorded by his companions, also in the Arabic language. This Arabic language was also used to write books and is essentially the same as the written Arabic you will find today. Over time, new words, for new inventions and concepts were added to the language.

However, the Arabic that the Arabs spoke changed through the centuries. Just like the English spoken 1400 years ago is vastly different from the English spoken today. So too is spoken Arabic today different from the Standard Arabic used in the Quran, hadith and written works.

So there are a few different types of Arabic:

1. Preserved Arabic:
   a. Classical Arabic dialects: This is the Arabic language at the time of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. Different regions had their own dialect which differed a little from other dialects in pronunciation, vocabulary, etc. But they all formed one language. The Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in this language.
   b. Classical Standard Arabic: A standard form of the Classical Arabic dialects was used for writing books. As Arabic became the language of science, scientists added new words for new concepts. With the new vocabulary it is also called post-classical Arabic. 
   c. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): Very similar to Classical Standard Arabic but with much new vocabulary for words like “car”, “telephone”, and other modern inventions. Some features of Classical Standard Arabic are unused in Modern Standard Arabic.
2. Modern Arabic dialects: Each region in the Arab world has its own variety of colloquial dialect used by Arabs to converse with each other. The modern dialects have their roots in the classical dialects. Some dialects are understood by speakers of other dialects but others have changed so much that they are not easily understood outside their region.

This tutorial will, if Allah wills, help you teach yourself Preserved Arabic, focusing on Classical Standard Arabic.
