# Introduction

[بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم]{lang=ar dir=rtl}

All praise is due to Allah, and may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon the Prophet Muhammad.

## History of Arabic 

The Quran was sent by Allah 1400 years ago to the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon him. The language of the Quran is the Arabic language, as it was understood by the Arabs at that time. The sayings and actions of the Prophet, may Allah grant peace and confer blessing upon him, were recorded by his companions also in this Arabic language. This is called Classical Arabic. The Classical Arabic language consisted of multiple dialects that were spoken in the different regions of Arabia.

All languages evolve over time. For example, the Old English language spoken 1400 years would be unintelligible to us today. So too did Arabic evolve and the Arabic dialects that are spoken today in the different regions of the Arab world have changed considerably from the Classical Arabic dialects. But in order that the language of the Quran not be lost, scholars made efforts to preserve Classical Arabic. 

In preserving Classical Arabic, a standard version from among the different Classical Arabic dialects came to be used as a literary language. A wealth of literature exists in this "Preserved Standard Arabic": books on explanations of the Quran, Hadith sciences, Islamic jurisprudence, etc. As scholars developed new branches of science, new terms and meanings were added to this Arabic. A few words were also borrowed from foreign languages as needed by the different scientific disciplines. 

In modern times, many new words and meanings have been added to keep up with technological advancements and modern media. This modern version of Preserved Standard Arabic is called Modern Standard Arabic.

## Focus of this book

In this book, we will study Preserved Standard Arabic. We will focus on the pre-modern language. If Allah wills, this will help you to begin to understand the language of the Quran, the Hadith, and Islamic literature.

If your goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic, then this book may help because the core language and the grammar is the same. However, you may prefer to study from a resource that focuses on Modern Standard Arabic.

This book does not touch at all on the modern colloquial dialects that are spoken in the Arab world today.

## How to study from this book

We will start with the Arabic script and present in each chapter a new concept of Arabic grammar. We will also give vocabulary for you to memorize and have chapter exercises. We strongly recommend that you memorize the vocabulary in full and go through the exercises by writing down the answers on paper with a pen. We strongly discourage you from:

+ answering the exercises verbally without writing them down,
+ looking up the answers before attempting to write the answer yourself,
+ looking up words in the vocabulary list without memorizing them,
+ proceeding to the next chapter before memorizing the vocabulary and going through the exercises.

The reason behind these recommendations is that, while Arabic grammar requires effort to master to a sufficient degree, the real barrier to reading and understanding Arabic texts by yourself is vocabulary. Arabic is a very rich language and knowledge of a few thousand words is needed before the student can begin to read texts by himself.
