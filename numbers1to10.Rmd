# Numbers from 1--10

Numbers are usually considered one of the more confusing topics in the study of Arabic. Therefore we will learn the numbers 1--10 in this chapter and deal with the remaining numbers later, if [#allAh]{.trn2} wills.

MOVE TO LATER BECAUSE OF thamaanin

# Notes:

+ counting numbers
+ ordering numbers
+ numbers as proper nouns
  + 1, 2, 3
  + 4 is half of 8
