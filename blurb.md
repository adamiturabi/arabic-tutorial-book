1. Set the scene: Who is the main character? The reader in need? Then who are your readers? Connect with them. Let them know this book is for them.

The primary texts of Islam (the Qur'an and the Sunnah) are in Arabic. But today, the majority of Muslims are non-Arabic speakers.

2. Thicken the plot. Describe or list problems your readers need your book to solve.

There is a need and desire for non-Arabic speaking Muslims to learn the language of Allah's message to them. Learning Arabic can help bring Muslims closer to this message and its teachings. 

3. Give hope: List some of the ways that your book can help achieve your reader's goals.

In this book, you'll find the tools (grammar, vocabulary, and exercises) you'll need to help you achieve a basic competency in written Standard Arabic.
