# Part 2 planning

## Contents

Part 1 should cover include higher forms of verbs, weak verbs, kaana, Dhanna, kaada, inna and its sisters, yes/no and what/who questions, ism mawSUl.

Part 2 will cover all the adverbial usages, conditional statements, exceptions, numbers, [كيف]{.ar} and [كم]{.ar} questions, and summary chapters on different types of masdars (ism al-masdar, ism al-marrah, masdar mimi, etc), al-Sifah al-mushabbahah, different types of [ان]{.ar}, [ما]{.ar}, negation, etc. Nouns of place and instrument, diminutive, affiliate noun.

Think about where to put ism fAeil and ism mafeUl, part1 or part 2? Maybe right before al-Sifah al-mushabbahah?
In Part 1 may make sense, at least to explain the Arabic terminology marfUe, manSUb, majrUr, jArr, majzUm, etc.

Where to put collective nouns?

Where to put ism tafDeel and tamyIz?

## Terminology

Start using non-italic romanized Arabic terminology instead of the made-up and translated terminology used in Part-1.
This is a controversial decision so think about it carefully.

Why not just start with Part 1? Because student is uninitiated in Part 1, and throwing around these Arabic terms will be overwhelming.

Pros:

+ Don't need to invent or translate any more terms for the different types of [مفعول]{.ar}, [حال]{.ar}, [شرط]{.ar}, [زائدة]{.ar}, [تفسيرية]{.ar}, etc. Inventing and translating terms is now more of a burden than a help, even for the student. Student is initiated enough to absorb unfamilar terminology.
+ Student gets familiarized with Arabic terms for help in future study.

Cons:

+ Different methodology from part 1 and part 2. 

Perhaps rename in Part-1 itself:

+ u-state to [R]{.sc}-state from "regular"
+ a-state to [N]{.sc}-state from "next" i.e. built on top of the regular state
+ i-state to [J]{.sc}-state from "jammed" as in closed and restricted.
+ n-marks to "nuned marks": 
  + un-mark to "nuned u-mark", etc.
  + "nuning" as the noun,e.g., Remove the nuning before annexing

R, N, J will help with moving to Rafe, NaSb, Jarr/Jazm in part-2

Also, maybe continue to use a select few English terms like noun, verb, plural, dual, sentence, word,

But not definite, indefinite, particle, article, preposition, prepositional-phrase, adverbial-phrase (use shibh jumlah).

### Inconsistency with al-

Note about "al-" in new terms. Will usually remove it. So we will say:

"The mafeUl muTlaq" not "al-mafeUl al-muTlaq"

"the Dharf makAn" not "Dharf al-makAn"

except we might say "the jawAb al-sharT" with duplicated definite article because it sounds more natural. al-sharT is probably referring to the defined sharT of whch this is the jawAb.

Hmm.., maybe use "The al-mafeUl al-muTlaq" and "a mafeUl muTlaq"  etc.

## Introduction

Introduction explains correspondence between the existing terms we studied in Part-1 terms and their new Arabic equivalents.

mubtada' is named so because the speakers begins with it. originally mubtada' bih but bih is usually dropped for convenience.

muDaaf is named because the speaker adds it to the base noun.

muDaaf ilayh is named because it is the noun that the speaker adds the muDAf to. it is a ism mafeUl.

Start using fatHah, kasrah, Dammah, shaddah, sukUn, tanwIn because student may be already be familar with them from tajweed classes.
etc.
