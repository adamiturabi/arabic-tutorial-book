# Sound plurals

## Introduction

Arabic uses the plural for nouns in number three and higher. The formation and use of plurals in Arabic can be somewhat complicated. One of these complications is that, in using plurals, Arabic distinguishes between rational beings and non-rational beings. Rational beings are those living beings that are endowed with reason like humans, angels, and jinn. Non-rational beings include animals, inanimate objects, abstract concepts, etc.

As a further complication, there is sometimes more than one way to use plurals. In this chapter we will explain the most common usages to keep things as simple as possible.

English regularly forms the plural by adding the plural ending "s" to the end of a singular noun. For example:

| Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| book       | books      |
| house      | houses     |
| boy        | boys       |
| girl       | girls      |

Arabic also forms some plurals by adding plural endings to to the singular noun. This kind of plural is call a _sound_ plural because the singular noun is kept more or less sound (intact) when adding the plural ending.

Arabic has two sound plurals:

1. The [Un]{.trn} plural.
2. The [At]{.trn} plural.

We will describe each of them in detail.

## The [Un]{.trn} plural

The [Un]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـُونَ]{.ar} [Una]{.trn} to the singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـِينَ]{.ar} [Ina]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state. For convenience, we will call it the "[Un]{.trn} plural" instead of the "[Una]{.trn}/[Ina]{.trn} plural".

| State | a (male) teacher | (male) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state |[مُعَلِّمٌ]{.ar} [mueallimun]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [mueallimUna]{.trn}| 
| a-state |[مُعَلِّمًا]{.ar} [muealliman]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [mueallimIna]{.trn} | 
| i-state |[مُعَلِّمٍ]{.ar} [mueallimin]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [mueallimIna]{.trn} |

Note that there are no [n]{.trn} marks for the [Un]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way:

| State | the (male) teacher | the (male) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُ]{.ar} [Ealmueallimu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimUna]{.trn}
| a-state | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَ]{.ar} [Ealmueallima]{.trn}| [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimIna]{.trn}  
| i-state |[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِ]{.ar} [Ealmueallimi]{.trn} | [ٱَلْمُعَلِّمِينَ]{.ar} [EalmueallimIna]{.trn}

### Applicability of the [Un]{.trn} plural

Except for very few exceptions, the [Un]{.trn} plural is used only for male rational beings. Of these exceptions, the word [سَنَةٌ]{.ar} [sanatun]{.trn} "a year" is the most common. It is pluralized as [سِنُونَ]{.ar} [sinUna]{.trn} in the u-state and [سِنِينَ]{.ar} [sinIna]{.trn} in the a-state and i-state.

## The [At]{.trn} plural

The [At]{.trn} plural is formed by adding the ending [ـَاتٌ]{.ar} [Atun]{.trn} to the indefinite singular noun when it is in the u-state, and [ـَاتٍ]{.ar} [Atin]{.trn} when the noun is in the a-state or i-state.

| State | an animal | animals
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [حَيَوَانٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnun]{.trn}  | [حَيَوَانَاتٌ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtun]{.trn}
| a-state | [حَيَوَانًا]{.ar} [HayawAnan]{.trn} | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtin]{.trn} 
| i-state |[حَيَوَانٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnin]{.trn}   | [حَيَوَانَاتٍ]{.ar} [HayawAnAtin]{.trn} 

Note that there _are_ [n]{.trn} marks for the [At]{.trn} plural. Definite plural nouns are also formed in the same way but they won't have [n]{.trn} marks:

| State | the animal | the animals
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnu]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAtu]{.trn}
| a-state | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَ]{.ar} [EalHayawAna]{.trn}| [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}  
| i-state |[ٱَلْحَيَوَانِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAni]{.trn} | [ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتِ]{.ar} [EalHayawAnAti]{.trn}

If a noun ends with a looped [tAE]{.trn} [ة]{.ar}, then it is removed before appending the [At]{.trn} plural ending:

| State | a (female) teacher | (female) teachers |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| u-state | [مُعَلِّمَةٌ]{.ar} [mueallimatun]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَاتٌ]{.ar} [mueallimAtun]{.trn}
| a-state | [مُعَلِّمَةً]{.ar} [mueallimatan]{.trn}| [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar} [mueallimAtin]{.trn}  
| i-state |[مُعَلِّمَةٍ]{.ar} [mueallimatin]{.trn} | [مُعَلِّمَاتٍ]{.ar} [mueallimAtin]{.trn} 

### The [At]{.trn} plural for words ending with [اء]{.ar}

If a noun ends with an [اء]{.ar} then the [hamzah]{.trn} may either be retained or get converted to a [و]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. This is done based on the same rules as for the dual which we explained in the previous chapter.

Thus,

+ REMOVE because plurals of descriptive nouns not yet discussed: [صَفْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SafrAE]{.trn} (root: [صفر]{.arroot}) becomes [صَفْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SafrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [صَحْرَاءُ]{.ar} [SaHrAE]{.trn} (root: [صحر]{.arroot}) becomes [صَحْرَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [SaHrAwAtun]{.trn}.
+ [إِبْطًاءٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEun]{.trn} (root: [بطء]{.arroot}) becomes [إِبْطَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [EibTAEAtun]{.trn}.
+ [سَمَاءٌ]{.ar} [samAEun]{.trn} (root: [سمو]{.arroot}) becomes [سَمَاءَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAEAtun]{.trn} or [سَمَاوَاتٌ]{.ar} [samAwAtun]{.trn}.

### The [At]{.trn} plural for words ending with [يٰ]{.ar}

If a noun ends with [ىٰ]{.ar}, then whether the [ىٰ]{.ar} is a feminine marker or not, it becomes a [yAE]{.trn} with an [a]{.trn}-mark [يَ]{.ar} when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. For example,  

+ [حُبَارَىٰ]{.ar} [HubArA]{.trn} becomes [حُبَارَيَاتٌ]{.ar} [HubArayAtun]{.trn}.

### Designative nouns of the pattern [فَُِعْل]{.ar} and [فَُِعْلَة]{.ar}

If a designative noun is of the pattern [فَعْل]{.ar} [fael]{.trn} or [فَعْلَة]{.ar} [faelah]{.trn}, and the middle letter is not [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, then the ∅-mark on the middle letter will be converted to an [a]{.trn}-mark when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. Therefore, 

+ [نَحْلَة]{.ar} [naHlah]{.trn} becomes [نَحَلَات]{.ar} [naHalAt]{.trn}, not [نَحْلَات]{.ar} [naHlAt]{.trn}.

If a designative noun is of the pattern [فِعْل]{.ar} [fiel]{.trn}, [فِعْلَة]{.ar} [fielah]{.trn}, [فُعْل]{.ar} [fuel]{.trn}, or [فُعْلَة]{.ar} [fuelah]{.trn}, and the middle letter is not [و]{.ar} or [ي]{.ar}, then the ∅-mark on the middle letter can either:

  i.   be retained,
  ii.  be converted to an [a]{.trn} mark, or
  iii. be converted to the vowel mark on the first letter.

Thus,

+ [ظُلْمَة]{.ar} can become either [ظُلْمَات]{.ar} [PulmAt]{.trn} or [ظُلَمَات]{.ar} [PulamAt]{.trn}, or [ظُلُمَات]{.ar} [PulumAt]{.trn}.
+ [كِسْرَة]{.ar} can become either [كِسْرَات]{.ar} [kisrAt]{.trn} or [كِسَرَات]{.ar} [kisarAt]{.trn}, or [كِسِرَات]{.ar} [kisirAt]{.trn}.

Note that this rule of changing the vowel mark is only true for designative nouns. Descriptive nouns will retain the ∅-mark when forming the [At]{.trn} plural. So [صَعْب]{.ar} [Saeb]{.trn} and [صَعْبَة]{.ar} [Saebah]{.trn} become only [صَعْبَات]{.ar} [SaebAt]{.trn}, not [صَعَبَات]{.ar} [SaeabAt]{.trn}.

### Applicability of the [At]{.trn} plural

We had mentioned that the [Un]{.trn} plural is used, with very few exceptions, only for male rational beings. Conversely, the [At]{.trn} is used for both female rational beings, and for non-rational beings (both masculine and feminine) like animals, inanimate objects, and abstract concepts. Rarely, it is also used for male rational beings.

Examples:

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمَاتُ فِي ٱلْمَدْرَسَةِ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimAtu fi -lmadrasati.]{.trn}  
"The female teachers are in the school."

[ٱَلْحَيَوَانَاتُ فِي ٱلْغَابَاتِ.]{.ar}  
[EalHayawAnAtu fi -lgAbAti.]{.trn}  
"The animals are in the forests."

## Plurals of descriptive nouns

It is not just designative nouns that have plurals. Many descriptive nouns may be pluralized with sound plurals as well. For example, [طَيِّبٌ]{.ar} [Tayyibun]{.trn} has the [Un]{.trn} plural [طَيِّبُونَ]{.ar} [TayyibUna]{.trn} and the [At]{.trn} plural [طَيِّبَاتٌ]{.ar} [TayyibAtun]{.trn}. The complete rules of whether a descriptive noun has a sound plural are somwehat complicated. For now, you may use the following rule of thumb:

Only masculine descriptive nouns that form their feminine by the addition of [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [Un]{.trn} plural. And all feminine descriptive noun that ends with [ة]{.ar} may be pluralized with the [At]{.trn} plural. But there do exist feminine descriptive nouns that don't end with [ة]{.ar} that form the [At]{.trn} plural. For example,

+ [كَبِيرٌ]{.ar} [kabIrun]{.trn} "big (masc.)" forms its feminine with the addition of [ة]{.ar}: [كَبِيرَةٌ]{.ar} [kabIratun]{.trn}. Therefore it can be pluralized with the sound [Un]{.trn} plural [كَبِيرُونَ]{.ar}. And [كَبيرَةٌ]{.ar} can be pluralized as [كَبِيرَاتٌ]{.ar}.
+ [غَضْبَانُ]{.ar} [gaDbAnu]{.trn} "very angry (masc.)" forms its feminine without [ة]{.ar}: [غَضْبَىٰ]{.ar} [gaDbA]{.trn}. Therefore it will not form the sound [Un]{.trn} plural.

In using plurals of descriptive nouns, Arabic distinguishes between rational beings and non-rational beings. Here we explain the usage of descriptive noun plurals with rational beings. We will explain the usage of descriptive noun plurals with non-rational beings in the next chapter, if Allah wills.

When a descriptive noun is describing plural rational beings, then the descriptive noun will be pluralized. For example,

[ٱَلْمُعَلِّمُونَ طَيِّبُونَ.]{.ar}  
[EalmueallimUna TayyibUna]{.trn}  
"The male teachers are good."

[كَانَتِ ٱلْجَارِيَاتُ ٱلطَّوِيلَاتُ سَرِيعَاتٍ.]{.ar}  
[kAnati -ljAriyAtu -TTawIlAtu sarIeAtin]{.trn}  
"The tall girls were fast."

## Pronouns for the plural

We have learned detached pronouns, completed-action verb doer-modifications, and attached pronouns for the singular and the dual. Here we will add the corresponding pronouns for the plural. We use the root [فعلل]{.arroot} as a template to show the verb doer-modifications.

|Person|Detached pronoun|Completed-action verb doer-modification|Attached pronoun|
|:---|:----|:----|:----|
| he/him |[هُوَ]{.ar} [huwa]{.trn} |[فَعَلَ]{.ar}  [-a]{.trn}  |[ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}|
| she/her |[هِيَ]{.ar} [hiya]{.trn} |[فَعَلَتْ]{.ar} [-at]{.trn} |[ـهَا]{.ar} [-hA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ masc.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[فَعَلَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| they/them~dual\ fem.~ |[هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn} |[فَعَلَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn} |[ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}|
| they/them~pl.\ masc.~ |[هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn} |[فَعَلُوا]{.ar} [-U]{.trn} |[ـهُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}|
| they/them~pl.\ fem.~ |[هُنَّ]{.ar} [hunna]{.trn} |[فَعَلْنَ]{.ar} [-na]{.trn} |[ـهُنَّ]{.ar} [-hunna]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ masc.~ |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} [Eanta]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتَ]{.ar} [-ta]{.trn} |[ـكَ]{.ar} [-ka]{.trn}|
| you~sing.\ fem.~ |[أَنْتِ]{.ar} [Eanti]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتِ]{.ar}  [-ti]{.trn} |[ـكِ]{.ar} [-ki]{.trn}|
| you~dual~ |[أَنْتُمَا]{.ar} [EantumA]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُمَا]{.ar} [-tumA]{.trn} |[ـكُمَا]{.ar} [-kumA]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ masc.~ |[أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} |[ـكُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}|
| you~pl.\ fem.~ |[أَنْتُنَّ]{.ar} [Eantunna]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُنَّ]{.ar}  [-tunna]{.trn} |[ـكُنَّ]{.ar} [-kunna]{.trn}|
| I/me |[أَنَا]{.ar} [Eana]{.trn} |[فَعَلْتُ]{.ar}  [-tu]{.trn} |[ـنِي]{.ar} [-nI]{.trn}/[ـِي]{.ar} [-I]{.trn}|
| we/us~dual~ |[نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} |[فَعَلْنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} |[ـنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn}|


Here we will re-list some of the rules for the singular and dual pronouns and add rules for the plural pronouns:

+ The dual attached and detached pronouns for the absent person "they/them~dual\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمَا]{.ar} [humA]{.trn}.
+ The plural attached and detached pronouns for the absent person "they/them~pl.\ masc.~" are pronounced the same: [هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}.
+ Only the dual verb doer-modification for the absent person differentiates between the masculine ([ـَا]{.ar} [-A]{.trn}) and feminine ([ـَتَا]{.ar} [-atA]{.trn}). Otherwise, the same pronouns are used in the dual for both genders.
+ Speaking person pronouns and verb doer-modifications do not differentiate between the masculine and feminine genders.
+ The singular attached pronoun for the speaking person is [ـنِي]{.ar} [nI]{.trn} when a doee pronoun, and [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn} otherwise. This [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn} becomes a [يَ]{.ar} [ya]{.trn} when preceded by an unvoweled [ي]{.ar}. Examples:
  + [لِي]{.ar}  
    [lI]{.trn}  
    "for me"
  + [ضَرَبَنِي.]{.ar}  
    [DarabanI.]{.trn}  
    "He hit me."
  + [فِيَّ]{.ar}  
    [fiyya]{.trn}   
    "in me". 
  + [إِلَيَّ]{.ar}  
    [Eilayya]{.trn}  
    "to me"

    Note that the [ي]{.ar} in [فِي]{.ar} and [إِلَىٰ]{.ar} gets doubled when it joins with the pronoun [يَ]{.ar}.

+ The attached pronoun and verb doer-modification for the dual/plural speaking person "we/us" are the same: [نَا]{.ar} [nA]{.trn}.
+ The same pronouns and verb doer-modifications are used for the dual and plural speaking person: [نَحْنُ]{.ar} [naHnu]{.trn} and [ـنَا]{.ar} [-nA]{.trn} respectively.
+ The [u]{.trn}-mark on the attached pronouns [ـهُ]{.ar} [-hu]{.trn}, [ـهُمَا]{.ar} [-humA]{.trn}, and [ـهُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn} becomes an [i]{.trn}-mark ([ـهِ]{.ar} [-hi]{.trn}, [ـهِمَا]{.ar} [-himA]{.trn}, and [ـهِمْ]{.ar} [-him]{.trn} respectively) when they are preceded by the vowels [◌ِ]{.ar} [i]{.trn}, [ـِي]{.ar} [I]{.trn}, or the semi-vowel [ـَيْ]{.ar} [ay]{.trn}. Examples: 
  + [عَلَيْهِ]{.ar}, [ealayhi]{.trn} "on him"
  + [فِيهِمَا]{.ar} [fIhimA]{.trn} "in them~dual~"
  + [بِهِمْ]{.ar} [bihim]{.trn} "with them~pl.~".
+ The final ∅-mark on the [مْ]{.ar} in the masculine plural pronouns ([هُمْ]{.ar} [hum]{.trn}, [ـهُمْ]{.ar} [-hum]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمْ]{.ar} [Eantum]{.trn}, [ـتُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn}, [ـكُمْ]{.ar} [-kum]{.trn}) becomes a [u]{.trn}-mark ([هُمُ]{.ar} [humu]{.trn}, [ـهُمُ]{.ar} [-humu]{.trn}, [أَنْتُمُ]{.ar} [Eantumu]{.trn}, [ـتُمُ]{.ar} [-tumu]{.trn}, [ـكُمُ]{.ar} [-kumu]{.trn} respectively) when followed by a connecting [hamzah]{.trn}. Examples:
  + [هُمُ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُونَ.]{.ar}  
    [humu -lmueallimUna.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ are the (male) teachers."
+ The plural masculine verb doer-modification for the absent person "they~pl.\ masc.~" [ـُوا]{.ar} [U]{.trn} has a silent [Ealif]{.trn} which is written only and not pronounced. This [Ealif]{.trn} is dropped when a doee pronoun is attached. For example: 
  + [ضَرَبُوا ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "They hit the man."
  + [ضَرَبُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabUhu.]{.trn}  
    "They~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."
+ The plural masculine verb doer-modification for the addressed person "you~pl.\ masc.~" [ـتُمْ]{.ar} [-tum]{.trn} becomes [تُمُو]{.ar} [tumU]{.trn} when a doee pronoun is attached. For example:
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُ ٱلرَّجُلَ.]{.ar}  
    [Darabtumu -rrajula.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit the man."
  + [ضَرَبْتُمُوهُ.]{.ar}  
    [DarabtumUhu.]{.trn}  
    "You~pl.\ masc.~ hit him."

## Verbs with plural rational doers

In section \@ref(chap-duals-sec-verbs-dual-doer) we learned that if a noun has a dual doer, then:

1. If the doer noun is placed before the verb or is not mentioned, then the dual doer-modification is employed.
2. If the doer noun is placed after the verb, then the singular doer-modification corresponding to the gender of the doer is employed.

We had given the following examples:

+ [ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "They~dual~ went to a house."
+ [ٱَلرَّجُلَانِ ذَهَبَا إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [EarrujalAni pahabA EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) men went to a house."
+ [ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَتَانِ إِلَىٰ بَيْتٍ.]{.ar}  
  [pahabati -lmarEatAni EilA baytin.]{.trn}  
  "The (two) women went to a house."

Verbs with plural doer nouns also a corresponding rule, using the plural doer-modification only when either the noun is not mentioned, or is mentioned but placed before the verb. However, this rule is only valid for doers which are rational beings. We will deal with non-rational doers in the next chapter.

Examples:

## Verbs with multiple doers mentioned individually

If there are multiple doers of a verb, and each is mentioned individually, then there is often more than one way to handle them. Here we will give the more common usage.

If the verb precedes the doers, then it will usually have the doer-modification of the first mentioned doer. Examples:

[ذَهَبَتِ ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْغُلَامُ.]{.ar}  
[pahabati -lEummu wa-lgulAmu.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the boy went."

If the verb follows the doers, then it will have the doer-modification corresponding to number of the doers. Example:

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ ذَهَبَتَا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu pahabatA.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the girl went."

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَتَانِ ذَهَبْنَ.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatAni pahabna.]{.trn}  
"The mother and the two girls went."

If the doers consist of both male and female persons, then the verb will have the masculine doer prefix corresponding to the number of the doers. Example:

[ٱلْأُمُّ وَٱلْجَارِيَةُ وَٱلْغُلَامُ ذَهَبُوا.]{.ar}  
[EalEummu wa-ljAriyatu wa-lgulAmu pahabU.]{.trn}  
"The mother, the girl, and the boy went."

If the doers consist of different persons (speaking person, addressed person, and absent person), then they are placed in order of strength: The speaking person is stronger than the addressed person, who is stronger than the absent person. The verb doer modification of the strongest person is then used. For example,
  
[ذَهَبْتُ أَنَا وَأَنْتَ وَهُوَ.]{.ar}  
[pahabtu Eana waEanta wahuwa.]{.trn}  
"I, you, and he went."

[أنْتَ وَهُوَ ذَهَبْتُمَا.]{.ar}  
[Eanta wahuwa pahabtumA.]{.trn}  
"You and he went."

[أَنَا وَمُحَمَّدٌ ذَهَبْنَا.]{.ar}  
[Eana wamuHammadun pahabnA.]{.trn}  
"I and [#muHammad]{.trn2} went."
